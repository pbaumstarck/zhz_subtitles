00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,200
In the year 1722,

18
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,700
Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty passed away.

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,400
Nian Gengyao, Viceroy of Sichuan-Shaanxi

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,700
and Long Keduo, Director of the Imperial Infantry

21
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:03,691
distinguished themselves during the Princes' fight for the throne

22
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,200
by notable service to the victory of Fourth Prince Yìnzhēn

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,000
They are now ministers highly esteemed by the new Emperor, <br> <i>Caption:</i> Yōngzhèng

All rise.

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,900
By the mandate of heaven, the Emperor hereby decrees

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Long Keduo, by loyal service to Emperor Kangxi, <br> <i>Caption:</i> Sū Péishèng (<i>Emperor's personal eunuch</i>)

33
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,300

appointed president of the Board of Civil Appointments, <br>concurrently charged with running the Li Fan Yuan.

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Nian Gengyao, Viceroy of Sichuan-Shaanxi, is hereby knighted Duke of Second Class.

37
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,200
All affairs related to the military <br> <i>Caption:</i> Nián Gēngyáo

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,300
as well as ministers of border defense, funds, <br> <i>Caption:</i> Zhēn Yuǎndào (<i>father of Zhen Huan</i>)

39
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,500
and the governors of Sichuan-Shaanxi and Yunnan <br><i>Caption:</i> Guāěrjiā Èmǐn

40
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,000
shall all report to General Nian. This is the Emperor's decree.

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,300
Gratitude for His Majesty's benevolent grace.

42
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,500
His Majesty indeed thinks very highly of General Nian

43
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,000
– and Sir Long Keduo. <br>– Congratulations Sir Long!

44
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,000
You have done the country a great service.

45
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,500
General Nian,

46
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,200
His Majesty truly appreciates you greatly.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,100
Sir.

48
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,400
You have rendered invaluable service to His Majesty.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,700
Please wait for a few moments, Great General Nian.

50
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,700
Great General.

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Imperial Eunuch Su, what can I do for you?

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,500
His majesty is concerned about the wounds on your arm

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,400
and has specifically instructed me to deliver this precious medicine to you,<br>for your use.

54
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,500
The humble Nian Geng Yao, appreciates his majesty's merciful grace.

55
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,700
I wish to ask, Royal Eunuch Su, <br>is my younger sister doing well in the Palace?

56
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,600
Hua Fei Niangniang's beauty and status surpass all in the Imperial Harem

57
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,700
Rest assured, Great General.

58
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,300
Please take care of her, Imperial Eunuch Sū.

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,200
It is my duty and pleasure.

60
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,100
(Hall of a Resting Soul: The emperor's study)

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,500
Your Majesty

62
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,500
From the House of Respectful Affairs. <br>(Records the Emperor's nightly visits to different concubines.)

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,400
Your majesty, please flip a name board over.

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
<i>Caption</i>： Xú Jìnliáng

65
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,600
Your Majesty, <br>it's been half a month since you've stepped foot into the harem.

66
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,500
If a name isn't flipped tonight, the Empress Dowager will surely punish me!

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Your Majesty!

68
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,700
You talk too much.

69
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,300
Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager is here.

70
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,700
Hurry up, show her in.

71
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,700
Yes, sir.

72
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,800
<i>Caption</i>: Empress Dowager (<i>tàihòu</i>)

73
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,800
Greetings, Your Highness. <br>(<i>literally, "may safety be with you"</i>)

74
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,700
Greetings, Imperial Mother

75
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,800
The weather has been warm lately. <br>I asked the Royal Kitchen to make some mung bean &amp; lily bulb soup.

76
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,400
I thought it was pretty good.

77
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,200
I brought you some, knowing you were awake.

78
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,100
Many thanks, Imperial Mother.

79
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,700
Your Majesty

80
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,500
These are the pickled vegetables Sir Long Ke Duo brought for the Dowager Empress fresh from Yang Zhou

81
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,600
He said that these are more delicious and refreshing than those made by Sanbi.

82
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,200
Over here.

83
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,800
Stop it with the long face.

84
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,700
It's like this everyday, no big deal.

85
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,400
It's already been over six months since His Majesty's coronation,

86
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,100
but we can count the number of his visits to the harem with one hand in any given month.

87
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,400
It's natural for the Dowager to be reproachful when the House of Respectful Affairs has less to do.

88
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,300
It must be distressing for you to be stuck in the middle.

89
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,800
Thank you for understanding my position, Royal Eunuch Su.

90
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,200
I hope you can bring the issue to His Majesty's attention on my behalf.

91
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
The Young Mistresses need His Majesty's presence,

92
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,100
the same way a dry field needs the rain.

93
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,900
We have said enough.

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,300
But His Majesty is so busy with state affairs lately that he can only manage to sleep 4-6 hours.

95
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,400
We wish to remind His Majesty to visit the Harem, but how do we even begin?

96
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,300
If Mother is bothered by the heat,

97
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,400
I can instruct them to bring some ice

98
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,800
to your palace.

99
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,000
The heat is not so bothersome now that I am old.

100
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,400
What worries me most is you.

101
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,600
You are always busy with state affairs...

102
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:08,300
But you can't neglect your own health.

103
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,900
I understand.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,400
As busy as you are, have you looked over the third prince's lessons?

105
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
I examined his work a few days ago.

106
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,100
His calligraphy is coming along, but

107
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,000
knowledge of his subjects still leaves much to be desired.

108
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,200
The former emperor had 24 sons, including you.

109
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,400
Your Majesty cannot compare with that.

110
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,800
I am not blessed with many children. I only have three sons.

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,100
I am sorry for making you worry about me.

112
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,500
It is not your fault.

113
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,500
The former Emperor had more consorts so naturally more children as well.

114
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,200
You only have a few consorts.

115
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,500
The Empress, Princess of Modesty (Duan Fei), Princess of Regularity (Qi Fei),

116
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,400
they are no longer young.

117
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,700
It would be difficult for them to give you children.

118
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,700
I am also concerned that my children are but few.

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,100
It is the Imperial Family's duty to have many children.

120
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,900
Only then can the dynasty see a long succession of heirs.

121
00:07:56,967 --> 00:08:01,067
It's for this reason that we need to audition new consorts every three years, to fill the harem.

122
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,400
It is as you lecture Mother.

123
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,300
Then we have agreed on hosting an audition.

124
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,700
I will do everything as per your arrangements.

125
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,900
I am old, what could I possibly arrange?

126
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,500
Let Internal Affairs Authority pick a propitious day.

127
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,200
After rounds of auditions,

128
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,300
the outstanding women will become your wives and consorts.

129
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,800
I will be waiting for my grandchildren.

130
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,400
The Empress is busy. Hua Fei assists her in managing the Harem.

131
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,200
Let Hua Fei manage the audition.

132
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,300
She is not only competent and beautiful,

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,600
but has already enjoyed your adoration for so many years.

134
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,200
It would not be a bad thing to have someone new.

135
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,700
Your affection should be shared equally by the harem, not adorning a single woman.

136
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,700
Yes, but I have just one request, Mother.

137
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:51,300
What would that be?

138
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,133
Since we are hosting an audition now, <br>I do not think it necessary to host any more in the future.

139
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:58,000
Every three years is much too wasteful.

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,400
I have always believed that the Manchu and the Han are all part of the same family.

141
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,900
So this time,

142
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,100
I would like to choose more girls from families of the Han military banners.

143
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10,833
These are just details, I see no problems.

144
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,767
As long as Your Majesty agrees to add to the harem.

145
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:17,433
But don't forget the existing consorts either.

146
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:21,433
No matter how important state affairs are, <br>you should still visit the Harem regularly.

147
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:26,900
And your Empress, she will always be the center of your Harem.

148
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,800
I understand.

My apologies for asking you to come at this hour.

151
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,900
I must have interrupted your afternoon nap.

152
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,581
How could I possibly as blessed as Niangniang as enjoy so much free time?

154

May I inquire what urgent business <i>niangniang</i> wishes to discuss?

155
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:49,467
The auditions are almost at the final round, where His Majesty will choose those who will remain.

156
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:51,100
How is everything?

157
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,800
Rest assured, Niangniang.<br> <i>Caption:</i> Huá Fēi (<i>literally "Princess Consort of Glory"</i>)

158
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:55,104
Huang Guiquan sent a reply in the afternoon.

159
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:56,867
saying that everything was in place.

160
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:59,200
Since His Majesty said the treasury was not as "strong" at the moment,

161
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,533
that we should learn to economize.

162
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,200
Although I cannot make money appear out of nowhere

163
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,100
I will at least uphold the Imperial honour.

164
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,800
How can other people understand the difficulty of MY job?

165
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:15,567
I must thank you for your troubles, Meimei. <br>(妹妹 <i>"mèimei" = "younger sister", often used figuratively</i>)

166
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,900
Also, I have ordered some new pastries to be made.

167
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,633
Meimei, please have a taste.

168
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,500
Huichun.

169
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,500
Meimei, pick for yourself.

170
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,400
Take whatever you wish.

171

Or maybe you have already had enough of these.

172
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,800
Jianqiu, bring the Peony Rolls to Hua Fei.

173
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,533
Yes.

174
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:46,667
– Songzhi. <br> – Yes.

175
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,400
Many thanks, Niangniang.

176
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,800
Aiya! Empress Niangniang, please forgive me!

177
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,100
I did not mean to.

178
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,600
Such a lack of matters!

179
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,800
You've shattered Niangniang's kind offer!

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Hadn't you better beg for Niangniang's forgiveness?

181
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:08,433
Please forgive me, Empress Niangniang!

182
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,500
You have served me from before my marriage into the Imperial family

183
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,100
And yet you are still capable of incomprehensible mistakes like the one you just made.

184
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,500
Why do I even bother teaching you anymore.

185
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,800
If the Empress will not forgive you,

186
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,967
I will not let you off lightly.

187
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:22,567
Meimei, these are just small matters. <br><i>Caption:</i> Sòngzhī

188
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:24,467
There is no need to be so angry.

189
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,800
She is not very bright and she is clumsy.

190
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,600
Thank you for forgiving her.

191
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,367
I will give her a good lesson after we take our leave.

192
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:36,033
Sòngzhī is your servant from your maiden home.

193
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:37,700
She is different from the other servants.

194
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Do not make her do things like serving tea or water.

195
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,300
Do not be angered, even if you think her incompetent.

196
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,667
Right?

197
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,133
Fuzi.

198
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,233
Greetings, Empress Niangniang.

199
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,300
Greetings, Hua Fei Niangniang.

200
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,800
She is newly selected by Internal Fairs Authority.

201
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,867
She is actually a bit intelligent, so why don't you have her?

202
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,300
Although Songzhi is clumsy and stupid...

203
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,200
The Palace of Wings has plenty of servants.

204
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,100
Why not keep her?

205
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:15,467
I have heard that servants from the Palace of Wings (Hua Fei's Residence) are competent.

206
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:18,433
Fuzi should learn from them.

207
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:21,133
Perhaps, with Sister's governance and by helping Songzhi do some heavy chores,

208
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:22,933
they will learn manners.

209
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,100
I will take my leave.

210
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,367
- We are leaving. <br>- Yes.

211
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,000
I wonder how the audition is going.

212
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,300
The Harem truly needs new faces,

213
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,200
so that His Majesty can finally have more children.

214
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,467
Go away. <br><br>Such audacity to think you can walk beside Niangniang!

215
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,200
Go, follow us from behind.

216
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:43,067
I cannot achieve prominence in affairs of the state as men can,

217
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,600
But I will not take myself lightly

218
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,400
If I were to marry someone,

219
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,400
I must marry the best man in the world.

220
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,800
Form a true conjugal bond, from which only death will separate us.

221
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,367
Bless me, Bodhisattva.

222
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,900
Hide my name from notice, so that I can be spared from entering the harem.<br>(Cap: Zhen Huan)

223
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,200
The Bodhisattva in this temple is said to be especially effective.

224
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:14,233
Young missus, your wishes will surely come true!

225
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,400
Young missus, other girls in the audition all pray to be selected.

226
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:19,467
Only our miss wants the opposite!

227
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,767
<i>Caption left</i>: Liúzhū <br> <i>Caption right</i>: Huànbì

228
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:24,667
The Bodhisattva will definitely grant your wish.

229
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:27,233
Shhhhh. If you say a wish out loud, it won't come true!

230
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:32,400
<i>Caption</i>: Wēn Shíchū <br> <i>(an imperial doctor)</i>

231
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,700
What day is this? <br>Even Doctor Wen is visiting the Bodhisattva?

232
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,800
This Imperial Doctor Wen is definitely strange.

233
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:43,400
Everyone knows that without consent from the Palace <br>he cannot accept patients outside of the Imperial Family.

234
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,633
But he comes to our residence at least twice a month.

235
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:46,800
You two talk too much.

236
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,100
Maybe I should ask Doctor Wen for a prescription

237
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,100
that will fix the two of you.

238
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,600
— Shichu Gege. <br> — Huan Meimei. <br> (哥哥 <i>"gēgē" = "older brother" or figuratively</i>)

239
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,100
I went to your manor just now to check on your family's health

240
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,800
Auntie Zhen said you came here to offer incense.

241
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,067
Walks are a nice way to relax.

242
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,300
Sister Huan, you do not have to hide it from me.

243
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,500
I know you have been worried

244
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,600
about the final round of auditions for quite a few days.

245
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,500
I do what is possible for me, <br>the rest I can only leave to fate.

246
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,867
Sister Huan, when my father was alive, he would often say

247
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,900
"my heart is as pure as ice in a vase of jade"<br>（line from a Tang dynasty poem; representing sincerity)

248
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
He asked that I give this vase to my future...

249
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,900
This has always been my wish as well.

250
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,500
If you accept it, you would not have to attend the auditions anymore.

251
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,800
In Emperor Shun Zhi's time (grandfather of the current Emperor)<br>it was decreed that

252
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
girls who qualify to be selected for the harem<br>(from families belonging to the Eight Banners, 4 Manchu, 4 Han)

253
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,800
cannot marry without first having being eliminated from the audition.

254
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,400
Brother Shichu wants to save me,

255
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,833
but you need not have offered an item of so great a value and sentiment.

256
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,700
I cannot accept this.

257
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:54,500
Sister Huan, although I am only an imperial doctor

258
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,600
who does not have an exceptional salary...

259
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,700
but I promise that I will do everything in my power <br>to ensure you a happy, secure life.

260
00:15:57,767 --> 00:15:59,233
I will cherish and protect you,

261
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,900
Prioritize you above all else.

262
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,100
Originally, my visit every half month to examine your family's health

263
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
and the opportunity to occasionally glimpse your smiling complexion

264
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,900
was more than enough for me.

265
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,500
But who could have thought...

266
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,700
and I know that,

267
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:13,800
you really have no wish to participate in the audition.

268
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,700
By saying this, Brother Shichu,

269
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:19,933
you will ruin the sibling-like affection we have always shared.

270
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,400
I do not have any brothers so

271
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,900
I have always valued you as my real older brother.

272
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,500
I naturally trust that you would treat me with kindness.

273
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,300
Of course, once you find me a sister-in-law,

274
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,133
you will treat her even better.

275
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,700
I may have startled you. But I truly hope you can

276
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,400
avoid the audition.

277
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,200
Not just because of how I...feel about you,

278
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,200
But also because Mr. Zhen once saved my father's life.

279
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,300
- Our families are friends of more than just one generation.<br>- What are they saying?

280
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,900
- That happened long ago.<br>- I don't know either.

281
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:56,500
It was nothing extraneous, please do not concern yourself over it.

282
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,633
But back then my father was also framed because

283
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:01,200
of battles within the harem for the Emperor's favour.

284
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,400
He could not isolate himself from their intrigues.

285
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,200
If a mere imperial doctor can end up like this...

286
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,900
If you are selected,

287
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:08,633
you will be embroiled in their conflicts.

288
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,300
I understand everything you say.

289
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,900
But if I do not go to the audition, Yurao will still need to go one day.

290
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,100
Since my family has no sons, I should at least be a filial daughter.

291
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,500
So pretty! <br><br><i>(Cap: Shen Mei Zhuang)</i>

292
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Walk a few steps. Let me have a look.

293
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,700
Here.

294
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,300
Very Nice. Our young mistress walks very elegantly.

295
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,800
The Emperor would approve of a more willowy waist.

296
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,700
Speak a little.

297
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:55,333
Shen Meizhuang, paying respect to Your Majesty the Emperor<br>and Your imperial Highness the Empress Dowager.

298
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,300
May all fortune and good health come to you.

299
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,867
Good. Very well behaved.

300
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,700
Should His Majesty ask what books you have read?

301
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,100
The Book of Songs, Mencius, Zuo Zhuan.

302
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,600
Wrong.

303
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,900
His Majesty is auditioning for concubines

304
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,533
to fill his Harem with women

305
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:14,000
who can give him children.

306
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,700
He is not looking for ministers or academic skill.

307
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,900
An ignorant woman is a virtuous one.

308
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,033
Yes. I understand.

309
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:41,433
(Hall of Health)

310
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:42,567
Royal Eunuch, here you are.

311
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:45,567
Hmm. Come here, all of you.

312
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,667
As per order of Hua Fei Niangniang,

313
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:53,000
in ten days the Hall of Health will host the final rounds of the auditions.<br>(Cap: Huang Gui Quan)

314
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,100
It must be cleaned thoroughly.

315
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,600
Clean and bright.

316
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,500
Should anything go wrong...

317
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,733
You all know how Niangniang is.

318
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,600
Watch your heads very carefully!

319
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:07,800
We understand, Royal Eunuch.

320
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,900
Now get back to work.

321
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:10,867
Yes.

322
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:15,333
Niangniang, please eat something.

323
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,633
Wait another minute.

324
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,300
It has been over ten days since His Majesty last came for a evening meal.

325
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,900
I heard that Hua Fei has already invited him.

326
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:29,067
I reckon His Majesty will have the meal in her palace tonight.

327
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,400
You will starve yourself, waiting like this.

328
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,200
The audition is in a few days.

329
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,400
His Majesty will doubtless come today.

330
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,900
Your Majesty shows much favor for Great General Nian and his followers.

331
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,967
But the majority of officials prove that

332
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:49,567
merit is easy to earn, <br>but hard to keep.

333
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,300
You are...cautioning me

334
00:19:54,310 --> 00:20:00,200
against those who would exploit my esteem and take advantage of the service they have rendered, to commit wrongdoings?

335
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,400
Your Majesty is indeed omniscient.

336
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,100
I have perhaps worried needlessly.

337
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,600
I humbly take my leave.

338
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:25,383
Your Majesty, the tea is cold.

339
00:20:25,383 --> 00:20:26,872
Let me pour you a new cup.

340
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:28,256
Not necessary.

341
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,600
Your Majesty, Zhou Ninghai from the Palace of Wings is waiting outside.

342
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:35,962
Hua Fei Niangniang invites you to take meal in her palace.

343
00:20:35,962 --> 00:20:37,321
I will not be going there.

344
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:40,167
Then Your Majesty would like to...

345
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:42,989
I will...go see how the Empress is doing.

346
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:44,100
Yes.

347
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:48,423
His Majesty is going to the Palace of Benelovent Hope.

348
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:55,300
Niang Niang, the dishes are getting cold.

349
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,278
I will reheat them.

350
00:20:57,278 --> 00:21:00,021
Heat them when His Majesty arrives.<br>(Cap: The Palace of Wings: Hua Fei's residence)

351
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:03,197
(Cap: Zhou Ning Hai)

352
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:11,933
Niang Niang, His Majesty will be...<br>having his meal at the Palace of Benevolent Hope tonight.

353
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,336
Alright.

354
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,647
Niang Niang, do not be angry.

355
00:21:20,031 --> 00:21:22,567
Why would I be angry?

356
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:24,942
She is, after all, the Empress.

357
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,100
His Majesty should take a few meals with her.

358
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,100
Tonight is not the 15th.<br>(Night of the full moon, which families customarily spend together.

359
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,500
(Only the Empress is the rightful wife; a concubine, no matter how adored,<br>is only a mistress, thus not "family"

360
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
in the way a wife is.)

361
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,200
Your culinary skill has improved again.

362
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,700
I'm happy that you like it.

363
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,700
You are Empress now.

364
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,400
Servants can handle the cooking.

365
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:57,967
Save yourself the trouble.

366
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:02,271
Although I am Empress, I am still your wife

367
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,200
as a wife, doing something for her husband

368
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:06,816
cannot be called troublesome.

369
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,000
This soup is flavored tastefully.

370
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,800
Jianqiu

371
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Your Majesty.

372
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:17,833
Our ancestors have a rule. Never more than three.

373
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,733
Although this duck soup is good,

374
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,600
you have already finished three bowls of it.

375
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,600
If you don't stop now,

376
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:27,375
it could be half a moon before you will be able to stomach it again.

377
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,500
I am fortunate to have you remind me.

378
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:34,898
Love fairly; regulate your affections, <br>and it will be prolonged.

379
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,900
With food, as with people.

380
00:22:36,936 --> 00:22:38,700
Is what you want to say.

381
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,000
Your Majesty sees right through me.

382
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,200
Your Majesty favours this dish.<br>Here, have some more.

383
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,633
Silence should be observed during mealtimes and during slumber.

384
00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:59,600
Today's tea is really good. Please have some.

385
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,450
No thank you. I will go to check on Hua Fei.

386
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:07,700
Take care, Your Majesty.

387
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:18,467
Greetings, Your Majesty.

388
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,133
Come here.

389
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,333
Don't wait outside from now on.

390
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,267
The autumn weather has cooled, you could catch a cold.

391
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:33,233
Thank you for your concern.

392
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,233
You are new here?

393
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,200
Yes, the Empress appointed me to serve Hua Fei Niangniang.

394
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,800
Not a bad looking girl.

395
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:47,733
Good enough to serve in your palace.

396
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:49,133
How old are you?

397
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:50,267
Seventeen.

398
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:51,800
Seventeen.

399
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,133
So young.

400
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:58,800
Now that I think about it, you were seventeen when you married me,

401
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,333
back then I was still a Prince.

402
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,833
Your memory is infallible, Your Majesty.

403
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,100
Do be careful.

404
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:36,300
Han and Man Military Banners, line up accordingly.

405
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:38,733
Two in a row.

406
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,800
Allow me to remind you young misses.

407
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,867
You have passed numerous rounds of auditions

408
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:46,633
to be examined personally by His Majesty and the Empress Dowager.

409
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,100
This is a huge honour,

410
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:50,921
but don't be nervous.

411
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:52,567
As long as you observe the imperial rules you will all be fine.

412
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:53,800
Two in a row!

413
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,033
If you are not chosen, His Majesty will announce for your name board to be dropped.

414
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:57,033
His Majesty will bestow a flower onto you, <br>and you will be allowed to go home.

415
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:59,267
If you receive a satchel, it means that you are either selected to stay,

416
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,318
or you could be immediately betrothed to someone of noble birth.

417
00:26:01,318 --> 00:26:04,767
But if you are more fortunate, you will become a concubine <br>and enter the Imperial Palace.

418
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:06,767
In which case you will remain temporarily in your respective homes.

419
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:09,800
Once you receive your titles, all that is needed is to wait for an auspicious day<br> to enter the Forbidden City.

420
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,733
Everything will depend on your destiny.

421
00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:13,651
Stop.

422
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,433
Continue.

423
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:29,633
Go

424
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:35,133
Two in a row!

425
00:27:39,094 --> 00:27:40,467
Two in a row!

426
00:27:40,467 --> 00:27:44,233
Han and Man please stand apart.

427
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:51,067
Two in a row.

428
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,300
What happened? Why are you so late?

429
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,100
How do you do, <i>gugu</i>? <br> (姑姑 <i>"gūgū" = "paternal aunt", also used for senior servants</i>)

430
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,367
You almost missed it.

431
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:05,300
If the city gate had closed,

432
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,267
this entire year would have been in vain for you! <br> (<i>Caption</i>: Ān Língróng)

433
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:08,767
I live very far,

434
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,633
and I could not find a fast carriage.

435
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:11,833
That is why I was stalled.

436
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:13,200
Please forgive me.

437
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,867
Okay. Come inside.

438
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:18,300
Thanks to GuGu, I made it.

439
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,700
If I had run into someone else, I would not have been so fortunate.

440
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,867
You are very good with words.

441
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,900
Hurry. Follow them at the end.

442
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,333
- Just go. <br>- Thank you, GuGu.

443
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,533
Go. Hurry up.

444
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,700
Mei Jiejie! <br> (<i>"jiejie" = "older sister" or figuratively</i>)

445
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,000
Huan-er! I had heard that you made it, <i>meimei</i>.

446
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,967
But I never found a chance to see you!

447
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:59,067
I had hoped that I wouldn't be selected!

448
00:29:00,733 --> 00:29:02,633
Jiejie must have been exhausted to come such a long way.

449
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:04,700
I have spent my time in the capital recovering,

450
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,733
so I feel much better now.

451
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,400
Now that you are living in your house in the Capital City

452
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,167
Unlike the old days when you lived in your grandparents' home,

453
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:12,233
We live practically next to each other in comparison,<br>visiting will be no difficult task.

454
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:14,800
Yes, I often think about

455
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,400
our bond growing up together.

456
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,000
You are dressed so plainly today.

457
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,767
But if you look closely, you are still a beauty.

458
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:26,133
Pleasing no matter what.

459
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,100
Oh Great Beauty Shen, hardly!

460
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,600
You've become so pretty that

461
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,700
His Majesty will never forget you again once he lays eyes on you.

462
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,700
Wait,

463
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,567
Everyone here is fantastic.

464
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:39,867
I may not get selected.

465
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,200
Unwanted gossip may arise if others hear us.

466
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,833
Xia Ruhua, daughter of the Magistrate of Jiaxing, is dropped.

467
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,433
Bestow the flower.

468
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:09,667
Fu Hua, daughter of Deputy Chief Fu An of the Bureau of Letters, is dropped.

469
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:11,333
Bestow the flower.

470
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:16,667
Cao Xiangyu, sister of Deputy Minister Cao Biying of Human Resources,

471
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:19,433
is dropped. Bestow the flower.

472
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,300
Lin Qingyun, daughter of Deputy Officer Lin Tingzheng of the Army,

473
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,200
is dropped. Bestow the flower.

474
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,700
Which family are you from?

475
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,400
How dare you pour such hot tea on me!

476
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,533
You don't want to live anymore?

477
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,000
In the imperial quarters, so close to His Majesty.

478
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:38,767
Who dares to be so impudent.

479
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

480
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,600
Answer the question. <br>Whose daughter are you!?

481
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,900
My...My name is An Lingrong

482
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,433
My father... My father is...

483
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:51,667
Are you telling me you don't know your own father's rank?

484
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,833
My father is An Bi Huai, Magistrate of Songyang Town

485
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,900
Just as I expected. An ignorant country girl from some poor, backward village.

486
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,867
Why go looking for shame in the Imperial Palace?

487
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,167
Do you have any idea who you've just offended? <br><i>She is Baoyi's (3rd highest rank of Royalty) daughter Xia Dongchun</i>

488
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,000
It's my first time in the Palace,

489
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,800
I panicked and made a grave error in splashing hot tea on you, Xia Jiejie.

490
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,100
It was not at all intentional.

491
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,100
Please forgive Lingrong's carelessness.

492
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:23,100
You have no hope of being selected, even if His Majesty sees you.<br>(Cap: Xia Dong Chun)

493
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:25,700
What do you have to panic about.

494
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,933
For you to even step foot in the Forbidden City

495
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:31,667
is already the chance of a few lifetimes!

496
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:34,033
How dare you dream of getting selected

497
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:38,100
If Jiejie is still angry

498
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,900
I can offer you a new set of clothes to compensate for the one I ruined.

499
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,467
Compensate?

500
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:54,467
What you have on right now looks newly made?

501
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,900
Such obvious stitch marks...must have been made in a hurry.

502
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,000
The fabric is Zhihua Silk,

503
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:03,833
something that has been out of fashion in capital city for quite some time.

504
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:08,967
This outfit here is made of Suzhou Silk.

505
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,500
Are you planning to pay me back

506
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,766
with those two remarkably plain, silver zanzi in your hair?

507
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,900
Or do you want to pay me back<br>with these two gold-plated, copper bracelets

508
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,700
that no one would want, even as a gift?

509
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:26,800
What happened here today was my fault.

510
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,833
Please forgive me.

511
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,233
I can forgive you,

512
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,900
but you must kowtow and beg for my forgiveness.

513
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,800
Only then will I be generous and...forget what happened.

514
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,400
Jiejie, don't make enemies

515
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,300
His majesty would never select a country bumpkin to be his concubine.

516
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:48,967
But Xia does have a chance of being selected.

517
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,700
Why aren't you kneeling.

518
00:32:57,833 --> 00:32:59,500
It's only a dress.

519
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,000
Xia Jiejie has a soul of benevolence and generosity, <br>this is hardly a matter to get so worked up about.

520
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,900
And you are?

521
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:08,167
My father is Zhen Yuan Dao, Coordinator of the Supereme Court.

522
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:12,500
Coordinator of the Supreme Court? <br><br>Hardly a high ranking official.

523
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,000
Justice belongs to righteousness, not to rank.

524
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,800
Are you trying to boss me around because you think yourself pretty enough to be selected?

525
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,900
Not at all. I am only concerned on your behalf.

526
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,500
Today is the audition for families of the Han military banners.

527
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,900
Jiejie might disturb His Majesty if you continue.

528
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,300
His Majesty's censure is not a matter to be taken lightly.

529
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,200
And even if His Majesty does not hear about this,

530
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,900
should anyone else find out about today's events,

531
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,000
Not only will it undermine your virtuous reputation

532
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,600
but it will also bring shame to the entirety of the Han Military Banners.

533
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,100
I do hope Jiejie will reconsider the stakes at hand before you make a rash decision.

534
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,900
I will remember this.

535
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,300
Your beauty is so indescribably moving that<br>YOU will be remembered by all who have glimpsed your face today.

536
00:34:04,233 --> 00:34:06,367
- Are you okay? <br>- Thank you for helping me.

537
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,800
I will never forget your kindness.

538
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:12,400
Please, think nothing of it.

539
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:17,100
That Miss Xia is not one to take anything lying down.

540
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,800
You incurred her wrath for my sake.<br>I fear that it will bring you distress.

541
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,100
If anyone should be distressed it is her,<br>not me.

542
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,800
I can't believe how reckless you are, did you forget where this is?

543
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,433
This is...?

544
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:28,767
This is Meizhuang <i>jiejie</i>.

545
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,600
How do you do, Meizhuang <i>jiejie</i>?

546
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
No need for formalities here, <i>meimei</i>.

547
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,200
People will scrutinize the attire before the attired.

548
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,800
It is an unfortunate fact, regardless of where you go.

549
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,500
Your attire does lack some slight adornments.

550
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
It's not especially surprising that some of them appeared slighting.

551
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,400
Take this pair of earrings as a token of our first meeting.

552
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,067
I can't!

553
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,600
I wish that you receive all your heart desires,<br>and rise above their prejudice.

554
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,300
I thank you for your generosity.

555
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,000
I am but from a humble family with humble connections

556
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,900
I may disappoint your kind intentions.

557
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,267
Origins do not decide a hero's fate.

558
00:35:14,306 --> 00:35:17,000
You have beauty. Why look down on yourself?

559
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,267
Next up: An Lingrong, Yi Bingqing

560
00:35:21,267 --> 00:35:23,667
Jiang Rulin, Dai Yin. Go

561
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:28,500
Liu Lianzi, Qi Siqin.<br>An audience of six.

562
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:40,033
Daughter of Magistrate of Songyang Town, <br><br>An Lingrong

563
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:41,367
Sixteen

564
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:45,567
I, An Lingrong, pay my respects to Your Majesty and the Empress Dowager.

565
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:48,133
I wish you great fortune and glorious peace.

566
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:55,600
Dropped. Bestow the flower.

567
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,567
I, An Lingrong, appreciate your time.

568
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:04,467
I wish your majesty and Empress Dowager her highness <br><br>a healthy, peaceful and joyful life.

569
00:36:04,467 --> 00:36:08,600
Others who were dropped allowed their dissatisfaction to show on their faces,

570
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,433
But you have surprisingly remembered propriety

571
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:12,800
It is an indescribable honor for Lingrong to come to the Forbidden City

572
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,100
and see the faces of Your Majesty and Empress Dowager Her Highness.

573
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,633
I have been blessed with fortune.

574
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:25,300
The flower in your hair is a nice touch.

575
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:30,467
Mother, she already wears a flower

576
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,300
what use would she have for another.

577
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:40,267
An Lingrong. Nameboard kept. Bestow the sachet

578
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,933
Father, Mother. I got selected.

579
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:05,733
I finally made it.

580
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:11,367
I didn't let you down. I got selected

581
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:23,433
All so vulgar.

582
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,800
Perfection may not exist.

583
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:28,267
Please consider the next generation of the Imperial family.

584
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,900
She'll do.

585
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,300
Daughter of Baoyi Director, Xia Dongchun. Eighteen.

586
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,333
Interesting name. Keep the name board. <br>(Xia=Summer Dong=winter chun=spring)

587
00:37:58,267 --> 00:38:01,167
Many thanks to Your Majesty

588
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:06,200
Xia Dongchun. Nameboard kept. Bestow sachet.

589
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,933
Daughter of Coordinater of Jizhou County, <br><br>Shen Meizhuang

590
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:18,800
Seventeen

591
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,200
I, Shen Meizhuang, pay respects to your majesty <br><br>and Empress Dowager her highness.

592
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,800
I wish your majesty countless blessings to accompany an infinite life.

593
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,000
I wish your highness serene peace and precious health.

594
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,067
Have you read any books?

595
00:38:31,067 --> 00:38:32,533
I humbly plead forgiveness for my dullness,

596
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:34,533
Having only read the "Rules of Women" and "Guidance of Women"

597
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:36,133
knowing but a few characters.

598
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:40,133
These two volumes are about women's virtues. Fitting.

599
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,000
Have you read the Four Books?

600
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,500
I have never read them

601
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:48,167
Ladies should focus on sewing and embroidery.

602
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:51,733
It's already very good that you can read a few characters.

603
00:38:51,733 --> 00:38:55,000
Thank you, Empress Dowager your highness.

604
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,167
Keep her name.

605
00:38:57,167 --> 00:39:02,767
Shen Meizhuang. Nameboard kept. Bestow a sachet

606
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:08,367
Daughter of coordinator of Supreme Court, Zhen Huan

607
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:11,233
Seventeen

608
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,667
Daughter of coordinator of Supreme Court, <br><br>Zhen Huan

609
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:20,633
Seventeen

610
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:25,033
I, Zhen Huan, pay respects to your majesty<br><br> and Empress Dowager her highness.

611
00:39:25,033 --> 00:39:27,200
Wish you all the blessings

612
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,033
Zhen Huan.

613
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,167
Which character is your Huan?

614
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:34,933
Huan Huan, a twist of a beauty's waist. <br><br>This is my nickname

615
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:38,267
Cai Shen's poem

616
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:39,533
Yes

617
00:39:39,533 --> 00:39:41,433
You are well versed in poetry and literature.

618
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:44,100
Zhen Yuandao educated his children well.

619
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,900
But I don't know if you deserve that name

620
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,667
Let me see your face.
