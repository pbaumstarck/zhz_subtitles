5
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:04,531
You are well versed in literature and poetry.

6
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:07,588
Zhen Yuandao taught you well.

7
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,100
But it remains to be seen whether you are deserving of your name.

8
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,180
Let me see your face.

9
00:00:35,382 --> 00:00:40,006
Your family name is Zhen. It's taboo to share the Emperor's name.
(Yong Zheng's given name was Yin Zhen)

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,400
Empress Dowager your highness,

11
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:44,000
When my father was an official in the time of Emperor Kang Xi,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,092
His Majesty Kang Xi remarked that Zhen is a good name

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,400
because it suggested loyalty and devotion; and as such, an encouragement for my father to be loyal and devoted.

14
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,700
I can understand Emperor Kangxi's intentions.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,800
Mother, I have remembered something

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,400
The Qiao sisters of Jiang Nan (historically the area south of the Yangtze River)

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,900
and Zhen Mi, the beauty of Hebei 
(All 3 women are found in the Tale of Three Kingdoms)

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,300
The Zhen family has always had beautiful daughters.

19
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:11,823
Zhen Mi was one of the three most beautiful women in the last era of the Han Dynasty.

20
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:14,000
Come forward.

21
00:01:41,263 --> 00:01:43,433
She has a certain sense of dignity.

22
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:47,467
ï¼ˆHe quotes the poem Zhen Huan's name comes from, meaning roughly:)
A shapely beauty, however elegant and graceful

23
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:51,300
Will lose her smoothness and the fragrant bloom of youth.
(A caution against over valuing external beauty)

24
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,367
But The forbidden city has a nurturing aura

25
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:58,100
You will not lose your youth and beauty before your time.

26
00:02:00,646 --> 00:02:03,389
Who is the girl next to her?

27
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:09,067
Sister of Sun Zhuhe of Suzhou's Weaving Factory, Sun Miaoqing. Sixteen

28
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:11,000
Sun Miaoqing failed to observe the proper Imperial Court etiquette.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,333
Take her away. She is never to be allowed to enter the Imperial auditions again.

30
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,882
Yes

31
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:18,633
Zhen Huan is kept. Bestow a sachet
- Your Majesty, grant me mercy.

32
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:20,733
Your majesty

33
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,800
Those who wished to stay have been sent away.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,100
Those who have no wish to stay can never leave again.

35
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,700
Do you know how many people dream of a life in the Palace?

36
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,133
Come now, don't sigh.

37
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:41,067
Besides, we will be going together.

38
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,700
We can look out for each other

39
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,867
By this time the eunuchs will have arrived to deliver His Majesty's Imperial decree. 
Uncle Zhen will surely be pleased.

40
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,100
Mei Jiejie.

41
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,000
It really wasn't my intention to be chosen.

42
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,700
I know you had no intention of being chosen, 
but Heaven did.

43
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:57,390
He couldn't bear to let such a glittering jewel be buried in a life of anonymity.

44
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,200
But his majesty

45
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,400
Sun Miaoqing is only easily scared, hardly a serious flaw.

46
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:08,267
The Son of Heaven deserves the highest reverence. She lost her composure too easily.

47
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,700
Please wait, my ladies.

48
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:17,267
I have orders to see you both safely out of the Palace young misses.

49
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:20,767
My sincere congratulations for your successes in the audition.

50
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,733
Take care of yourself, Jiejie.

51
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,733
You as well, Meimei.

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,500
Huan Huan, a twist of a beauty's waist.

53
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:21,000
Your majesty. The Empress wishes to see you.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,167
- Let her in 
- Yes, sir.

55
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,867
I am here to congratulate Your Majesty on your acquisition of more, worthy beauties.

56
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,500
What have you heard?

57
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,200
Word is all over the Palace.

58
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,400
Your Majesty was very happy with the results of today's audition.

59
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,300
There were one or two of acceptable quality among the drones of unmemorable faces.

60
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,600
Acceptable! 

I heard that Shen Zishan's daughter has an air reminiscent of Jin Ping (Pin Princess of Dignity).

61
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,800
And that the Zhen girl is a carbon copy of...

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
No more than a slight resemblance around the eyes and brow bone.

63
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:06,167
Even a small resemblance is remarkable.

64
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:10,100
I shouldn't say this, but...

65
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,333
Has Your Majesty thought of a rank for Zhen?

66
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,200
Gui Ren (Precious) will do. (6th rank of Princess consorts)

67
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,600
Precious?

68
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,300
Ok. Guiren it is.

69
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,167
Aside from Fucha of the Manchu Banner being Guiren,

70
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:27,233
and Borjite from the Mongolian Banner also being Guiren.

71
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,200
Of the girls from the Han Banner

72
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:30,933
there are also two Guiren.

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Who's the other one?

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Shen Guiren. Shen Zishan's daughter.

75
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,500
Shen Zishan's official post is after all ranked higher than that of Zhen Yuandao.

76
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,000
Although your majesty thinks highly of the Han Banner.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,567
the long tradition of miscegenation between the Manchu and the Mongols must be respected.

78
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,000
If the Han Banner has two Guiren... 

Would it not be too conspicuous?

79
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,100
Then make Zhen a Chang Zai (Lingering). (7th rank, though here he calls it 6th.)

80
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,800
She is from the Han Banner after all,

81
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,233
it won't do to rank her too high.

82
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:59,000
We trust Your Majesty's judgment.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,533
Though she is only a Changzai

84
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,533
I nevertheless want to give her a title.

85
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,800
Then I will instruct Internal Affairs Authority to come up with some choices.

86
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,500
No need. I already have one in mind.

87
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,433
Come here.

88
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,300
Smile (Wan) ?

89
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,200
I remember a poem from the Tang Dynasty;

90
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:29,100
There was the line: 
"A willow branch abundant with luxurious verdure"

91
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,300
Snakes down, dotted with a crush of nameless blossoms."
(She knowingly quotes a different "Wan" than the one he wrote)

92
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,300
There are few things more pleasing to the eye than Zhen's smiling visage.

93
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:56,433
Liuzhu, are we close to home?

94
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,100
Yes. Look miss, what a lively scene

95
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,900
Here she comes.

96
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,267
I can see her.

97
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,167
Congratulations. Congratulations

98
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,300
Congratulations. Congratulations

99
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:33,400
Father

100
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:39,867
Your servant Zhen Yuandao, with family in tow, respectfully greets the honorable Young Mistress.

101
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:42,400
Greetings, Young Mistress.

102
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,300
What is the meaning of this? Stand, stand!

103
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,100
Don't, Young Mistress, it would be improper to dismiss official etiquette.

104
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:50,562
Miss, you are an official Young Mistress now.

105
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,100
The Master is supposed to salute you according to etiquette.

106
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:55,467
Exactly so.

107
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,000
Liuzhu, Huanbi. Hurry and help Father and Mother up.

108
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:02,267
We are grateful for your kindness, Young Mistress.

109
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:08,433
It's windy outside. Let's go inside and talk.

110
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,900
This way please, Young Mistress

111
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,033
Watch your steps

112
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:25,967
I am an unfilial daughter.

 I cannot keep you company in your old age.

113
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:27,100
Rise, rise!

114
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:29,372
Moreover I've subjected you to this new set of etiquette that needs to be complied with.

115
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,667
My heart cannot help but be uneasy.

116
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,633
Please allow me to finish

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,700
Although I now belong to the Imperial Family

118
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,300
But I will not disregard filial piety.

119
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:44,200
I ask you Father and Mother, to allow me to conduct myself
towards you as I have always done, before I depart home

120
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,100
If you will not grant me this request, 
I would that I stay kneeling until you do.

121
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:50,567
I understand.

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,400
I have not raised you in vain.

123
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,633
Rise now, do rise.

124
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:13,000
Niangniang, You are awake?

125
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,633
Niangniang will rise.

126
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,600
I answer you respectfully Niangniang,

127
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,100
His Majesty stayed at Xin Changzai's place last night.

128
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,500
His Majesty doesn't visit the Harem for over 10 days

129
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,300
then he goes to that bitch when he does come.

130
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,467
It's been more than a month since she miscarried.

131
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,700
hasn't she had enough of the pitiful act?!

132
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,900
She's definitely playing her slutty tricks again.

133
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,267
Imbecile! How dare you be so careless?!

134
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,167
Niangniang, please forgive me!

135
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,100
What kind of servant are you?!

136
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,600
You were deliberately trying to harm Niangniang, weren't you?!

137
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,667
I know you did it on purpose!

138
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,130
Such a ruckus and so early in the morning too!

139
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,500
Why is she still here?!

140
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,967
Niang Niang, please spare me. 
- Away with you.

141
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:22,667
Niang Niang!

142
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:26,500
Niang Niang! Niang Niang!

143
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,900
Spare me!

144
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,033
Niangniang, it looks as if Hua Fei will not be coming today.

145
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:53,133
Why don't we just end it early?

146
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,300
I am the Empress. She is but a mere consort.

147
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,767
She is obligated by protocol to come pay her respects to me.

148
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:03,000
We will wait, however long it takes. 
 Tea.

149
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,300
Yes, Niangniang.

150
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,300
Huichun, bring the tea.

151
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,833
Hua Fei is last again.

152
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,533
She is the Great General Nian's younger sister

153
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:27,000
Great General Nian has seen such favor from the Emperor

154
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,500
And His majesty dotes on Hua Fei like no one else. 
(Cap: Xin Changzai)

155
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,200
Hmph. So what if she gets the most attention. 
(Capï¼š Qi Fei)

156
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,800
The one and only Empress is up there.

157
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,633
Speaking of which, 
(Cap: Cao Guiren)

158
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,900
It's been a long time since we last saw Duan Fei.

159
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Aiyo! Duan Fei, that sickly creature!

160
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,900
Nine out of ten days, she canâ€™t even get out of bed!

00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:57,533
Hua Fei arrives.

162
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,833
Greetings Hua Fei Niang Niang.

163
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,567
Please rise.

164
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,200
Looks like Xin Changzai has made a full recovery 

 You are quite early aren't you.

165
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,700
Thank you kindly for your concern, Niangniang.

166
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,100
I am not quite used to being up and about so early just yet

167
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,900
but I simply could not be late for paying my respects to the Empress.

168
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,400
It must be hard for you.

169
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,900
You need to take extra care of yourself after a miscarriage.

170
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:36,867
Your own health is tantamount in ensuring more heirs for His Majesty.

171
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:38,433
Thank you, Empress.

172
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:40,400
I answer you respectfully Empress Niang Niang,

173
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,033
Though Xin Changzai has yet to recover fully,

174
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:44,833
she is much better than before.

175
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,500
I also think she looks much more energetic.

176
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,900
Qi Fei Jiejie looks a bit more plump,

177
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,500
His Majesty will surely be pleased.

178
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,367
Thank you for your gracious words, Meimei

179
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,300
Oh, I almost forgot

180
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,000
It must have some time since His Majesty last visited Qi Fei Jiejie.

181
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,000
I have such a bad memory, please don't mind me Jiejie.

182
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,100
No harm.

183
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,400
Enough of that. We are all sisters here

184
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:14,967
no need to keep each other standing.

185
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,500
Take your seats.

186
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,800
Thank you, Empress.

187
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,967
- Greetings, Empress. 
- Do sit down, have a cup of tea.

188
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yes.

189
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,700
Huichun. Bring Hua Fei Niangniang's tea.

190
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,300
This is last year's Longjing Tea?

191
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,700
Niangniang hasn't finished it?

192
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,000
Old tea

193
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:49,567
No matter how carefully stored, will still smell moldy.

194
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,600
I gave my unfinished tea to Songzhi and the servants.

195
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,900
I have some of this year's tributary Yu Qian Longjing
(leaves harvested before the rainy season in late April)

196
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,100
Songzhi can bring some later for Niangniang to have a taste.

197
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,733
Thank you for your concern

198
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
His majesty also gave me some of that.

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,700
But I figured that the third prince would enjoy it,
so I gave it to Qi Fei (birth mother of the third prince).

200
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,500
But of course.

201
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:12,433
It must be a rarity for Qi Fei Jiejie to receive tea of such quality.

202
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,900
The next time the third prince wants anything,

203
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,167
don't hesitate to ask me.

204
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:19,533
The third prince is most filial.

205
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:21,933
He would never disturb His Majesty over a triviality.

206
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,400
The credit goes to Qi Fei for raising a disciplined son.

207
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:26,467
the third prince is indeed filial

208
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:29,500
He must be very fond of study, 

knowing how much His Majesty values knowledge.

209
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,433
And if His Majesty is happy,

210
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:33,067
neither Longjing tea,

211
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:36,233
nor even leaves of gold, will pose any difficulty.

212
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:41,467
the fourth and fifth princes are still young. 

third prince is the oldest, and thus most exemplified prince

213
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,300
so his character will naturally be commendable.

214
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,900
His Majesty's ascension to the throne was such a rushed affair.

215
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,500
The Palace still lacks many things.

216
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,300
How deplorable that the Empress has to live in this Palace of Benelovent Hope.

217
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,800
I was thinking that we should pick a nice day and really decorate this palace.

218
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,333
It should make Niangniang's home more comfortable.

219
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,900
How very considerate of you Meimei

220
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,767
His Majesty has not been in power very long yet 

We must be frugal if we can.

221
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,867
This matter can wait.

222
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:10,000
The Empress is indeed benevolent.

223
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,233
In comparison, my Palace of Wings is much too lavish.

224
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,400
I feel uneasy every time I visit you Your Highness.

225
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,833
The Palace of Wings used to be the residence of the previous Emperor's Yi Fei,

226
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,500
It is naturally grand.

227
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,100
Indeed. Yi Fei mothered many children, 

Emperor Kangxi was very fond of her.

228
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,400
It's getting late, I will take my leave of you.

229
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,533
Your Highness, I will take my leave as well.

230
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:59,500
We take our leave of you.

231
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,100
What conceit. But it only took a few words from Niangniang to shut her up.

232
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,400
I only spoke the truth.

233
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,133
Our palace may not be the most opulent,

234
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:19,167
But it is a place of felicity.
(Capï¼š Jian Qiu)

235
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:22,133
His Majesty gifted this Palace of Benelovent Hope to Niangniang
 because of your virtue and compassion.

236
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,000
That is a truelly harmonious union.

237
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,200
Don't be angry Niangniang, 

the Empress is only jealous of the attention His Majesty gives to our palace.

238
00:16:30,704 --> 00:16:33,167
Indeed, the former Yi Fei was greatly favoured and bore many children.

239
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,700
But her son was charged with treason, which implicated her.

240
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,767
She was cursing me with a similar fate.

241
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:39,433
There's no need to take her words seriously Niangniang,

242
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,533
Just look at how frail the Empress appears

243
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:45,167
she wouldn't dare to compete with you even at full health

244
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:49,333
His Majesty will surely antagonize her if she dares to antagonize you.

245
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,367
Aren't you wise.

246
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Not at all. All I know is that His Majesty cherishes Niangniang like no one else.

247
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:02,167
Exactly. The Palace of Benelovent Hope is the Empress' residence.

The Palace of Wings is Niang Niang's residence.

248
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,100
Of all the palaces, only our palace (Yi Kun Palace) and The Palace of Peace (Kun Ning Palace)

249
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,900
where the Imperial Wedding took place, share the character Kun.

250
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:11,067
This shows how much His Majesty values Niangniang.

251
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:14,867
Exactly. Courtesy is all that exists between the Emperor and Empress.

252
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,333
But His Majesty's regard for you is undisputed.

253
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:32,033
We are here.

254
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:41,567
Are you a sister of Sister Zhen?

255
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:47,633
No way. Huanbi and I are the same, we are the personal maids of our young miss.

256
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:51,800
Even a servant is dressed in such finery. 

The Zhen Manor must be very splendid.

257
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,200
Miss Zhen is waiting for you inside Young Mistress.

258
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,800
Mrs Zhen is waiting as well.
Please go in.

259
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:04,433
Jie Jie.

260
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:07,367
We are sisters. Such formality is unnecessary.

261
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:10,833
Auntie and I are connectionless here in the Capital

262
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,367
I'm very fortunate to have met you.

263
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:15,200
Now that you are here, you are no longer alone.

264
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,100
Do have a seat, Young Mistress An.

265
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,033
This is ?

266
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:24,933
This is Auntie Xiao.

267
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:28,133
She accompanied to the Capital to assist me with things.

268
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:29,967
Have a seat. Auntie

269
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:31,100
Thank you.

270
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,700
It's only because of your kindness that I have a safe place to stay Jiejie,

271
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:38,167
Nothing will ever repay the enormity of my debt to you.

272
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,600
I will feel at loss if you don't stop being so polite.
What are friends for?

273
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,600
I hope the journey was not disagreeable?

274
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,600
Don't get me started! The innkeeper almost wouldn't let Young Mistress An go, 
thinking that he could profit from her.

275
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,867
But I scared him off in the end!

276
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:54,615
It was all thanks to Liuzhu's quick thinking.

277
00:18:54,615 --> 00:18:55,869
Otherwise,

278
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,500
we would not have been allowed to leave, even if we paid him extra.

279
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,500
It's all thanks to Jiejie's good instruction that Liuzhu is so useful.

280
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:06,300
If you don't mind me asking,

281
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,133
which is the month of your birth?

282
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:11,400
I am seventeen this year. Born on April 17.

283
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,755
I'm sixteen this year. Born on Feb. 9.

284
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:17,600
You are really younger than me. 

I need to call you Meimei from now on.

285
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,134
Yes. I will do everything Jiejie says.

286
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:25,400
Huan er,

287
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:29,767
Father. Why are you still up?

288
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:35,633
-Have a seat.
- Yes.

289
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,900
I have observed these few days, you have done well taking care of Young Mistress An.

290
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,533
Dad knows that you have grown up.

291
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:05,900
There is something that maybe I'm not supposed to say.

292
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,433
But at this point I feel like I have no other choice.

293
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:11,000
You must remember.

294
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,033
If you are not perfectly confident about keeping his majesty's regard.

295
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:20,167
You would do much better to keep a low profile and remain as anonymous as possible.

296
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:24,900
I'm not counting on you to rise to prominence and monopolize His Majesty's affections,

297
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:29,200
I would rather that the pearl of my eye

298
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,633
enjoy a peaceful, long life devoid of cares.

299
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:42,433
I don't seek His Majesty's affection

300
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,400
only that I can be safe in the Palace

301
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:49,200
and protect the lives of our family, as well as my own.

302
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,567
Good. I am glad to hear this.

303
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:59,219
Then, according to the rules,

304
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:03,167
You can bring a personal maid with you into the Palace.

305
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:06,100
This servant must be trustworthy

306
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,033
as well as smart and competent

307
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:11,533
Have you decided who to bring?

308
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:13,133
I have made up my mind

309
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:16,600
Liuzhu is smart. Huanbi is cautious

310
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,833
I want to bring them with me.

311
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:23,833
Good. The three of you grew up together

312
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:31,267
I can set my mind to rest with them accompanying you.

313
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:36,033
Especially Huanbi...she...

314
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:46,000
She is after all your younger sister.

315
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,400
What?

316
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,300
I have never told your mother about this

317
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,767
Many years ago. I...

318
00:21:56,767 --> 00:22:00,367
I met a Han girl.

319
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:04,967
Then... we had Huanbi

320
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:09,300
No wonder when you brought Huanbi home

321
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,300
You said only that she would be my maid

322
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:18,367
Her mother was not only a Han girl

323
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:22,233
but she was also the daughter of an indicted official.

324
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:24,900
If the truth ever gets out

325
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,767
Not only will it affect you negatively

326
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:30,567
but Huanbi's life could be in danger as well.

327
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:37,167
I betrayed your mother's trust

328
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:40,000
And made Huanbi live an unfair life

329
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,533
You had your reasons, Father.

330
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:48,000
I will keep Huanbi's secret in mind.

331
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,100
If the opportunity ever rises

332
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,567
I will do my utmost to find a good husband for her

333
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:58,267
I appreciate it. The rest is up to fate.

334
00:22:58,267 --> 00:23:02,133
All these years, Huanbi and I have been like real sisters.

335
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:05,286
I won't mistreat her.

336
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:07,000
Good.

337
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,333
Our miss is a young mistress now.

338
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,433
Yep, she sure is!

339
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:19,367
I hear she can bring maids with her to the Palace

340
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:20,833
as company.

341
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,067
Mhm, what about it?

342
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,000
Would you go?

343
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,700
Going where?

344
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,667
The palace!

345
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,367
I will go wherever our miss goes.

346
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,900
I grew up with her

347
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:33,833
I will never leave her.

348
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,267
And will you go?

349
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:40,600
I don't know.

350
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,900
Miss treats you so well!

351
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:45,333
I didn't say that she doesn't treat me well.

352
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm only thinking

353
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,100
If we all leave with Miss so suddenly,

354
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:52,367
Who will serve the Master...and Madame?

355
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:54,067
You are right.

356
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,300
Master was the one who brought us here.

357
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,500
But, our job is to serve Miss

358
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,400
As if Master and Madame will ever need us to worry about them

359
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:08,467
By the mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:

360
00:24:08,467 --> 00:24:12,167
Daughter of Zhen Yuandao,

 Coordinator of the Supreme Court, Zhen Huan

361
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:16,433
is hereby granted the sixth rank, Changzai, titled Wan

362
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:21,267
She is to enter the Imperial Court on the 15th day of the 9th month (Lunar Calender).
Qin Ci.

363
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:24,800
We thank Your Majesty's benevolent grace.

364
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,000
By the mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:

365
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:33,467
Daughter of An Bihuai, 

Magistrate of Songyang town, An Lingrong

366
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:36,367
is granted the 7th rank Daying (Promise).

367
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:40,967
to enter the Imperial Court on the 15th day of the 9th month.
Qin Ci.

368
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:42,933
My thanks for Your Majesty's benevolent grace.

369
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:44,533
Everyone, please rise.

370
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:49,767
Master Zhen
(lit. Person of great status/prestige/rank)

371
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,100
This is Fang Ruo GuGu, who teaches Imperial etiquette in the Palace

372
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,100
Greetings, Gugu

373
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,600
What a clever Young Mistress,

374
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
She is a credit to you, Master Zhen.

375
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,667
Thank you for your praise, Gonggong (Royal Eunuch)

376
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,667
Don't mention it.

377
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,500
Earlier, I brought another Gugu to Xia Changzai's home

378
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,200
Their manner was quite lofty.

379
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,533
(Cap: Fang Ruo)

380
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:14,467
Your servant, Fangruo, 
pays respect to Wan Changzai and An Daying.

381
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:16,500
May good fortune be with you, Young Mistresses

382
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,700
Gugu is no ordinary person
ï¼ˆolder Imperial servants are respected because)

383
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,300
Formal salutations will be unnecessary while you instruct us.
(of their long service and connection at Court)

384
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,100
I am hardly deserving of being bowed to by you.

385
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,100
You are very courteous Young Mistress.

386
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,633
Gonggong. Thank you for your hard work.

387
00:25:28,633 --> 00:25:31,133
The heat has remained lingering these past few days.

388
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,000
You have been inconvenienced on our behalf.

389
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,800
You are too kind Madame Zhen.

390
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,500
Fangruo Gugu has served in the Imperial Court for a very long time

391
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,600
She taught Imperial etiquette to Young Mistresses even in Emperor KangXi's time.

392
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,700
The two Young Mistresses can't do wrong by attending carefully to Gugu's instruction.

393
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:49,533
We thank you for your elaboration Gonggong.

394
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,300
Since Young mistresses Zhen and An live together

395
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,000
it would be inconvenient to send a separate Gugu

396
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,000
We will trouble Fangruo Gugu to instruct them both.

397
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:02,100
The Young Mistresses can also help each other.

398
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,400
It is no more than what I should do.

399
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,700
Gonggong, please have some tea in the 
reception hall (room usually reserved for receiving guests).

400
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,267
I can't, I still need to see to the next Young Mistress.

401
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:13,067
Ah, then this way please Gonggong.

402
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:18,933
Young mistresses.

403
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:21,833
There were eight girls chosen this time.

404
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,700
They will enter the Palace on two different days.

405
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,800
First are the Manchu and Mongolian girls. Then the Han girls.

406
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,000
Young mistresses An and Zhen,

407
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,567
And Shen Guiren of the family of Jizhou province's Coordinator.

408
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:34,100
Will enter on the same day, with the second group.

409
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,567
Jizhou Province Coordinator

410
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:38,633
Mei Jiejie is a Guiren!

411
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:41,033
we need to congratulate Mei Jiejie.

412
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,400
Yes, the three of us will have more time to spend outside,

413
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:48,200
and we are friends so we can watch out for each other

414
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:52,567
Oh? There's truly a girl capable of such arrogance?

415
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,900
Xia Dongchun is indeed arrogant, thinking she comes from a good family.

416
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,300
and is now a Changzai.

417
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,300
I heard that she had the audacity to Gugu went there yesterday.

418
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:04,867
I suppose she must be quite pretty?

419
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:07,900
She hasn't even stepped foot in the Harem and she's already bullying people.

420
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
This I have to see.

421
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,200
Oh, I heard that on the day of the audition some girl stopped her. 

Who was it?

422
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,500
It was Zhen Huan, the daughter of Zhen Yuandao, 

Coordinator of the Supreme court.

423
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,900
His majesty seemed to like her quite well; she was chosen as well.

424
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:25,833
She was granted the rank Changzai.

425
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,267
The harem will be quite lively from now on.

426
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:32,167
Tell Xia's Gugu

427
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,700
she need not be overly attentive with her lessons,
since the girl is so unappreciative.

428
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,000
That goes without saying, Niangniang.

429
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:46,667
Everyone cries about being poor.

430
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,600
Taxes are owed every single year.

431
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,067
There is not one province that doesn't owe the central government at least several hundred thousand.

432
00:27:56,067 --> 00:28:01,067
The country is poor.

 The people are poor.

433
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:05,567
So where did all the money go?

434
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:07,967
Please calm down. Your majesty

435
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,700
Your majesty, I figured,

436
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,167
money, being such a useful thing,

437
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:15,900
goes where it ought to go.

438
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,767
Have you heard, Your Majesty

439
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:20,500
right now a thousand year old piece of land can have eight hundred owners.
(...infer what you will)

440
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:26,867
Please flip a nameboard over Your Majesty.

441
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,200
Who said you could open your mouth, I never even told you to come in.

442
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,000
But Your majesty, the hour has already arrived.

443
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,200
Then Xin Changzai will do.

444
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,500
I must report, Your Majesty,

445
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,600
Young Mistress Changzai's green board has been put up.

446
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,200
Her name board will likely be unavailable for a month or two.

447
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:43,067
Why is that?

448
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,500
Hua Fei Niangniang said

449
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,700
Young Mistress Changzai hasn't fully recovered from her miscarriage

450
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:51,833
So she might be unable to attend to Your Majesty.

451
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,667
Hua Fei can be so willful.

452
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:02,600
Fine. Tell Xin Changzai to take good care of herself,

453
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,400
I will go visit Hua Fei instead.

454
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,567
Yes

455
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,400
His Majesty arrives.

456
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:17,267
Greetings Your majesty.

457
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:21,567
Where is your Niangniang? Why isn't she here to greet me?

458
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:22,533
Replying to your question,

459
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:24,200
Niangniang felt unwell today

460
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,633
so she went to sleep early.

461
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:26,933
Already?

462
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:34,233
I will go back then, since she is already asleep.

463
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:38,467
It's about time that I visit Qi Fei and the third prince

464
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,800
Don't bother coming again if you leave.

465
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,233
Childish. You are more willful than ever.

466
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:49,300
It's been awhile since your last visit,

467
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,900
perhaps you've already forgotten the name Shilan. (Hua Fei's name)

468
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,000
Nonsense

469
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,300
You are the only person who would ever dare to be this rude in front of me.

470
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,500
You smell very good.

471
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,200
It's the special Huan Yi incense (Joy &amp; Pleasant) that Your Majesty has gifted only to me,

472
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,000
I use it everyday

473
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,800
Exactly. This is the scent that I love

474
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,800
no one else has it.

475
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,167
We common people all have our own Master and Mistress at home,

476
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:29,200
It's the same inside the Forbidden City.

477
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,233
But there are only three true masters.

478
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:35,433
The Empress Dowager, the Emperor, and the Empress.

479
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,800
The other consorts can only be called "Young Mistress"

480
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,033
This is the inviolable rule that sets the "Di" (true wife and her issue)
apart from the "Shu" (consorts and their issue)

481
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,500
For example, even though Hua Fei Niangniang is the Emperor's uncontested favorite

482
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,300
she is still only just the Young Mistress Hua.

483
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,500
If we were being polite, we would call her Hua Fei Niangniang.

484
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:53,167
Niang Niang?

485
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,000
Yes.

486
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:56,700
But the title Niangniang

487
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,100
is not for just anyone either.

488
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,800
She would need to be in charge of her own Palace 
(where other, usually lesser concubines also reside)

489
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:04,000
And her rank has to be "Pin" (ranked fifth, above Guiren) and above

490
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,400
Only when she is mistress of her own palace can she reside in its main residence,

491
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,033
and manage its daily affairs.

492
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,433
There is but one mistress in every palace,

493
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,800
but there can be an unlimited number of 
Guiren (6th), Changzai (7th) and Daying (8th) in any given palace.

494
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,800
Then I have the lowest rank.

495
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,100
Actually no, Daying is not the lowest rank.

496
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,333
The lowest is Guan Nuzi (Serving Women).

497
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,800
I have only heard of the pea sized government official (lit. sesame) ranked 9th,

498
00:31:27,867 --> 00:31:31,100
who knew that the same existed for a Young Mistress in the Harem?

499
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,000
What is a "Servant Lady"?

500
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,100
A Servant Lady is not so different from the serving maids

501
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,300
the only difference being that they can attend His Majesty at night.

502
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,900
If His Majesty likes her, she could be promoted to the rank of Daying.

503
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,000
Custom has it that serving women can only be promoted one rank at a time.

504
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,200
You can't skip a level.

505
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:04,132
Niangniang, your humble servant greets you respectfully.

506
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:05,900
Rise

507
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,199
Thank you, Niangniang

508
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:10,266
Niangniang, The Empress has drawn up the plans for

509
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:12,132
the new Young Mistresses' residences.

510
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:14,500
She wanted me to read it to you

511
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,167
If you find anything inappropriate, it can be modified.

512
00:32:18,733 --> 00:32:19,699
All right. Read it.

513
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:22,900
From the Manchu White Banner, Fucha Guiren will live in the Palace of Lasting Fortune (Yan Xi Gong)

514
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,300
From Mongolian Minor Red Banner, Boerjijite Guiren will reside in the Palace of Essence (Zhong Cui Gong).

515
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,400
From Han Minor Yellow Banner, Shen Guiren will be in the Palace of Whole Blessings (Xian Fu Gong).

516
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,567
From Han Blue Banner, Wan Changzai is in the Palace of Imperial Heritage (Cheng Qian Gong).

517
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:36,233
What did you say? Wan Changzai?

518
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:39,100
Yes. Eldest daughter of Zhen Yuandao, Coordinator of Supreme Court

519
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,167
Of all the newly chosen Young Mistresses,

520
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:44,533
only she received a title. 
Though her rank is not high.

521
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:47,233
The eloquent one?

522
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,900
Yes. You are correct.

523
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,567
Is this Palace of Imperial Heritage appointed to her by His Majesty?

524
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:55,367
His Majesty had nothing to do with drawing up the residences.

525
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:57,333
Everything has been to the directions of the Empress.

526
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:00,133
The Palace of Imperial Heritage is extremely well situated.

527
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:03,700
Not only is it large and grand, but it's also close to His Majesty's study.

528
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,633
The Empress really knows how to make His Majesty happy.

529
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,400
She would give him anything for just one word of praise.

530
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,800
She is herself getting along in years,
so she's preparing replacements who will be loyal to her.

531
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:20,500
The Palace of Imperial Heritage...does she mean for her
to be the sole inheritor of the Imperial attachment?

532
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,500
Let's talk about His Majesty now.

533
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:27,367
His majesty was the fourth son of the Former Emperor,

534
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:29,667
Formerly the Prince (Duke) of Yong (Harmonious).

535
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,600
He was married in his Princely Mansion.

536
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:34,967
The bride was the current Empress Dowager's niece, by a cousin.
(ie., her first cousin once removed; his second cousin)

537
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,500
Of the family Wulanala.

538
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,500
The Duchess was compassionate, wise, and elegant. People adored her.

539
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,100
She and His Majesty were deeply in love.

540
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:50,100
Unfortunately, three years after their ceremony the Duchess died in childbirth.

541
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,100
The infant prince died as well.

542
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,167
His Majesty is still saddened by the event, even now.

543
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:01,467
He bestowed upon her posthumously the title Chun Yuan Empress ï¼ˆEmpress of Purity).

544
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,800
It shows how constant our Majesty's affection is.

545
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,500
Then the current Empress?

546
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,600
I heard that the Empress is issued from a concubine (shu)?

547
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,700
The blessed are not bound by the distinction of "Di" and "Shu."

548
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,800
Her highness the Empress has a virtuous nature, she is the mother of the nation.

549
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,300
I spoke out of turn.

550
00:34:24,733 --> 00:34:28,067
Empress Niangniang is the Empress Chunyuan's s younger sister.

551
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,100
The Empress Dowager appointed her to the then Prince Yong as a duchess-consort.
(one rank beneath the Duchess)

552
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,500
After the death of Empress Chunyuan,

553
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:36,300
the duchess-consort inherited the Duchess's rank.

554
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,233
His Majesty treats her with courtesy and respect.

555
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,700
Are there any other palaces available?

556
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,000
There is...

557
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,000
the Palace of Jade Fragments (Sui Yu Xuan), where Fang (Fragrance) Guiren used to reside,

558
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,800
is tidy and somewhat refined, but it's a little out of the way,
a bit far and not too big either.

559
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,500
Not too big? It's tiny!

560
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,700
And there is also a stage there formerly used for opera performances.

561
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:03,400
It only became a residence for the less popular concubines because the Former Emperor thought it too far as a theater.

562
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:06,000
The location is also said to be unlucky.

563
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,900
Unlucky?

564
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,200
Just because Fang Guiren was banished to the 
Leng Gong after her miscarriage...

565
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
(Leng Gong, lit. Cold Palace; place that concubines who fall out of favor are banished to,
most remain there til death.)

566
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,600
What's the big deal?

567
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,467
If she moves in,

568
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,200
she might even conceive a child like Fang Guiren had done.

569
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:22,567
Wouldn't that please the Empress even more?

570
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:23,733
Yes.

571
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:26,000
Who else lives in the Palace of Jade Fragments?

572
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,067
No one.

573
00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:29,833
Clean it up a little,

574
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:33,167
Get it ready for Wan Changzai's arrival.

575
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,600
What of that Xia girl?

576
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,200
The one that His Majesty pointed to on a passing whim, 
the one whose name he called "interesting."

577
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:46,100
Yes, the Empress had to ask His Majesty to make her a Changzai as well,
 because of her father's official rank.

578
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,000
So you think the Empress is inclined to show her favor?

579
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,700
I can't be sure.

580
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,900
Watch her for me.

581
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
In case she intends to swear her allegiance to the Empress.

582
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,300
Put her in with Fucha Guiren.

583
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,200
We'll see how her insolence likes that.

584
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,367
But I heard,

585
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:07,267
His majesty now showers his attention on Hua Fei Niangniang.

586
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,800
Yes, it is so.

587
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,067
Hua Fei Niangniang is the Great General Nian's younger sister.

588
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,500
Her position was already uncontested even while His Majesty was still the Prince of Yong.

589
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,900
But if Hua Fei is indeed so adored by His Majesty,

590
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,500
why hasn't she been granted the title Gui Fei (Noble Consort, 3rd rank)

591
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,100
or Huang Gui Fei (Imperial Noble Consort, 2nd rank) yet?

592
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,200
That brings me to my next point.

593
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:26,600
The reason is because Hua Fei Niangniang has never borne any children.

594
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,000
So Hua Fei Niangniang was promoted to the rank of Fei (4th rank) without any children?

595
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,100
That's how highly His Majesty regards her.

596
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,300
Of course, His Majesty's affection is not the most important thing,

597
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,933
but conceiving a heir is.

598
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:44,000
Even a princess is better than no children at all.

599
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,533
Otherwise, you will have absolutely nothing to rely on.

600
00:36:47,533 --> 00:36:52,633
But of course Hua Fei Niangniang still has her youth and health,

601
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:54,500
plus His Majesty's affection,

602
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,100
so naturally she will have eventual offspring.

603
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,600
I heard that Hua Fei Niangniang's beauty is beyond compare?

604
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,900
She is indeed a celebrated beauty within the Han Banner.

605
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,533
Well, not just in the Han Banners,
but in all of the Eight Banners, the Manchu and the Monglian together,

606
00:37:05,533 --> 00:37:08,600
there is not one who can hold a candle to her.

607
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,700
That is why she is foremost in His Majesty's affections, and his Harem?

608
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,400
Li Bai (poet) once said

609
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,833
How long can you like someone if you only like her appearance?

610
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,600
Niangniang, Hua Fei changed Wan Changzai's residence

611
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,133
to the Palace of Jade Fragments (Sui Yu Xuan).

612
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:29,267
Poor girl.

613
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,900
That place is quite remote,

614
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,500
not to mention extremely plain.

615
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,533
It used to be no more than an opera stage.

616
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,900
Oh, Fang Guiren used to live there!

617
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,400
Hua Fei can be so insolent, making such a change,

618
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:44,333
without even one word in advance to Your Highness.

619
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:47,700
You speak of it as if it's something new.

620
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,500
That insolence is exactly what His Majesty likes about her.

621
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,333
Another Grey hair.

622
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:01,267
Whose nameboard did His Majesty flip tonight?

623
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,900
His Majesty is busy with state affairs today.
He has decided to rest at the Hall of a Resting Soul.

624
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,767
He is likely still awake.

625
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,500
I guess it's just as well.

626
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,100
His Majesty has a fondness for Wan Changzai.

627
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,300
Since the place is so undecorated and obscure,

628
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,567
send some osmanthus trees
(homonymous with "noble")

629
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:18,667
to ornament it a little.

630
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:21,267
Rest assured, Niangniang. I will take care of everything.

631
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:32,800
People always say that once you pass the Palace gates, 

you are forever separated from the life outside.

632
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,600
I'd never expected for it to happen to our family.

633
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,300
Promise you'll take excellent care of yourself.

634
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,600
And be extra cautious with your interactions inside the Harem.

635
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,800
Don't start conflicts and don't involve yourself in disputes

636
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Especially involving the Emperor's favorite, Hua Fei Niangniang.

637
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,400
If, one day, you have the fortune of becoming someone His Majesty esteems highly, then good,

638
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,300
But it's more important to stay alive.
Do you understand?

639
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,333
I will be careful,

640
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:09,300
so that you will have no reason to be concerned for me.

641
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:18,100
After I am gone, I'll need you to take care of father and mother, for me as well as yourself,
do you understand?

642
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,633
Yurao understands.

643
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,867
Young Mistress, time is running out.

644
00:39:48,433 --> 00:39:50,433
I have to leave now,

645
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:57,867
Please take care! Father, Mother!

646
00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:05,466
