5
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,861
Greetings, Young Mistresses.

6
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:17,824
This is...?

7
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:20,097
This is the side door forthe Gate of Obeisance and Chastity.
(Gate north of the Imperial Garden)

8
00:01:22,813 --> 00:01:24,120
Side door?

9
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,601
Consorts are only allowed to enter the Forbidden City through side doors .

10
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:30,598
The Main Gate is reserved for the Empress.

11
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,080
Mei Jiejie.

12
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
Young Mistress, there will be plenty of time to talk later,

13
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,000
the eunuchs will show you to your residences.

14
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:44,364
It's getting late.

15
00:01:44,364 --> 00:01:46,689
your luggage have already been delivered to your palace

16
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,933
by Internal Affairs Authority.

17
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,700
Please enter the Forbidden City right away.

18
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,700
Which palace has been assigned to Wan Changzai?

19
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:52,959
Sui Yu Xuan (Palace of Jade Fragments).

20
00:01:56,302 --> 00:01:58,680
Please go Young Mistress, there is nothing for you to worry about.

21
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:04,453
Wan Changzai, this way please.

22
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:08,005
An Daying, this way please.

23
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:13,099
Shen Guiren, please walk this way.

24
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:20,570
How splendid, no wonder people dream about coming to the Forbidden City.

25
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,978
The wild geese are flying. It's an auspicious sign.

26
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:35,695
Young Mistress, let's hurry. There is still a long way to go.

27
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:40,946
Greetings, Young Mistress.

28
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:41,964
Rise.

29
00:02:41,964 --> 00:02:43,009
Thanks, young mistress.

30
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:46,902
Guiren, this is your Chang Xi Tang (Hall of Perpetual Luminance).

31
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:47,920
It's quite regal.

32
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:50,167
Many thanks, Gonggong

33
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,242
Gonggong, from our Young Mistress, please treat yourself to a cup of tea.

34
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:57,037
My thanks Guiren, this way please.

35
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,862
Isn't it getting more and more deserted?

36
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,363
It's not deserted, only peaceful.

37
00:03:06,363 --> 00:03:09,602
Yes, our Young Mistress likes peace.

38
00:03:09,602 --> 00:03:12,658
Young Mistress, there is your residence.

39
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:17,465
-Thank you, Gonggong. 
-Excuse us.

40
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,048
Someone like you got selected?!

41
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:26,817
It's as they say, the road is narrow for enemies.
(Idiom: enemies will clash inevitably)

42
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:31,597
Although...you're just a Daying aren't you?

43
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,885
An Daying, everything is ready for you.

44
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,900
The House of Respectful Affairs has already delivered your luggage.

45
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:47,167
Greetings, Xia Jiejie.

46
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:49,333
Don't call me that, I can't afford to be your "jiejie,"

47
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,633
I'd rather not catch your poor person germs thanks.

48
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:56,518
Greetings, Xia Changzai.

49
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,612
Greetings, Xia Changzai.

50
00:04:01,612 --> 00:04:04,720
That's more like it.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,516
Young Mistress, let's step inside.

52
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,009
Young Mistress, we are here.

53
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,500
- It looks like it's been renovated.
- It's pretty.

54
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,700
Indeed.

55
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,700
This was where Fang Guiren lived when His Majesty first became the Emperor.

56
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:29,133
His Majesty specifically commissioned for it to be renovated.

57
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,400
So Fang Guiren also lives here?

58
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:33,867
...this way please, Young Mistress.

59
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:38,392
Wan Changzai arrives!

60
00:04:38,392 --> 00:04:42,363
Your servants welcome Young Mistress. Greetings, young mistress.

61
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:44,567
All rise.

62
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:48,500
Please feel free to relax now that you have arrived Young Mistress.

63
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,304
We will take our leave of you.

64
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:51,700
Thank you Gonggong.

65
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,100
We have cleaned the whole day in preparation for your arrival Changzai,

66
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,933
are things to your expectations?

67
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:04,071
"Palace ï¼ˆPavilion) of Jade Fragments," an exquisite name.

68
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,567
If I may,

69
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:08,167
the East and West Halls are to the sides of the Main Hall,

70
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:09,713
the bedchamber is in the back,

71
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:11,633
and behind that is a small garden.

72
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:14,467
To the south is Yin Lu Xuan (Lodge of Flowing Green),

73
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:16,867
it's a place to be away from the heat on hot summer days.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,700
The pear flower trees in the back are exquisite during flowering season,

75
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,000
it's where the name Jade Fragments comes from.

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,667
Oh, the Crabapple Trees' red blossoms are very festive during bloom

77
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:31,233
Why there is a stage here?

78
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,200
The consorts customarily enjoy watching operas,

79
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,167
so there are stages almost everywhere.

80
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,167
The stage here was a little too out of the way

81
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,911
so people gradually stopped coming.

82
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,600
Which was why it was eventually converted into a place of residence.

83
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,100
But it's a pleasant place don't you think?

84
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,460
It's indeed a place of tranquility.

85
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,800
Young Mistress, this is a new tribute, a gold osmanthus tree.

86
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,600
The Empress had it specifically prepared for you.

87
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,685
Osmanthus signifies nobility;
the newly planted osmanthus in Sui Yu Xuan

88
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:02,689
signifies the arrival of someone distinguished,
a cause for celebration all over the Harem.

89
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:03,433
Yes yes yes.

90
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,400
How kind and thoughtful of Her Highness the Empress.

91
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,100
Please step into the Main Hall now Wan Changzai.

92
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:35,833
Your servant, Sui Yu Xuan's Leading Eunuch, Kang Luhai,
respectfully at your service, Wan Changzai.

93
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:39,200
May your every wish come true, and many blessings grace you.

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,867
I am your humble servant, Leading Maid, Cui Jinxi.

95
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:46,067
My respects to Wan Changzai,

96
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,700
May you be blessed.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Rise, both of you.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,167
- Yes 
- Thank you Changzai.

99
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,300
I heard that a Fang Guiren also lives here?

100
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,800
I would like to pay my respects to her first.

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,600
Young Mistress has not been informed,

102
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,700
Fang Guiren no longer lives at Sui Yu Xuan.

103
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,800
The West Hall is currently vacant.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,500
Chun Changzai (Pure/Genuine) of the East Hall arrived four days ago.

105
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:13,000
You will have a chance to be introduced soon.

106
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,300
Young Mistress, this is Xiao Yunzi.

107
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:20,400
These two are Kang Luhai's disciples.

108
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,767
Xiao Hezi and Xiao Yinzi.

109
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,267
These are the maids Pei Er and Ju Qing.

110
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:29,567
They are all appointed specifically to care for your needs.

111
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,500
Greetings, Wan Changzai.

112
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,700
From now on you will all be mine.

113
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,700
I do value cleverness and aptitude in a servant,

114
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,000
but nothing is more important than loyalty.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,433
Yes. yes. yes

116
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,533
Do you understand?

117
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:52,467
We dedicate our allegiance to you and only you.

118
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:55,067
Rewards.

119
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,900
We await for your orders.

120
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Mistress must be tired from such a long day, please rest.

121
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:08,700
You may all go for now.

122
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,193
Yes. Yes.

123
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,100
Cui GuGu, you must have served in the Palace for quite some time already?

124
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,800
I am undeserving Mistress, please call me by my (humble) name.

125
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,300
Gugu, please be at ease.

126
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,600
I've never been a huge fan of formalities.

127
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,100
We are mistress and servant in name,

128
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,632
but you are my elder, and much more experienced than I,

129
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:39,467
I have much respect for you.

130
00:08:40,756 --> 00:08:42,767
I am not deserving, Mistress.

131
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:45,467
I used to serve the Consort Dowager.

132
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,000
The Consort Dowager enjoyed peace and solitude,
so I was moved here instead.

133
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,167
The Consort Dowager's servants must be very steady.

134
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,433
You flatter me.

135
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,400
Then I shall trouble you to manage all household affairs
together with Kang Gonggong.

136
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:01,567
Please rest assured that I will devote all of my effort to serving you, Young Mistress.

137
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,600
Gugu, please rest now,

138
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,200
Liuzhu and Huanbi can help me change.

139
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,500
Then I will take my leave.

140
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:25,800
Phew, let's sit! 

We've been restraining ourselves the whole day.

141
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:32,667
The Palace is so full of all sorts of rules, it's enough to scare me witless!

142
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,600
But everything is all so fancy-looking too!

143
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,900
Stop being so enraptured by your surroundings! Don't forget, rules, rules, rules!

144
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:40,233
You two came with me from outside the Palace,

145
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:42,833
we all need to be extra cautious with what we say and do,

146
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,200
so that nothing bad befall us.

147
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
I know

148
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,300
We'll all be fine as long as Liuzhu keeps her quick tongue in check!

149
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,800
- Shut up!
- Her quick tongue is not necessarily a bad thing,

150
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,700
she knows what should and shouldn't be said.

151
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,100
We were together growing up,

152
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,600
now we are together in this Forbidden City.

153
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,600
Without trustworthy people by your side, life in the Palace is like

154
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,300
the experience of a blind person walking at the edge of a cliff,
with the looming threat of a horrible death overhead.

155
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,800
Our fates are irreversibly entwined now.

156
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:20,333
I know you treat us as if we were your real sisters,

157
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,900
Huanbi and I will always do our utmost to protect you.

158
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,633
You will protect me, 

and I will do my best to protect you.

159
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:29,567
Rest assured. Young mistress..

160
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,700
NIangniang has been reading all morning

161
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,300
won't you have some mandarin oranges? They are a fresh tribute.

162
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,000
The newly selected concubines will have all settled down by now?

163
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:43,067
Yes, they should all be resting at their respective palaces by now.

164
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,100
What a rare moment of respite for me,
for Hua Fei to administer to everything by herself.

165
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,667
Even the mention of Hua Fei makes me angry.

166
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:53,400
These mandarin oranges here...
there were originally some high quality pomelos (grapefruit variant) available,

167
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,533
but Songzhi from Hua Fei's palace took them instead,

168
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,800
all the while saying that since His Majesty will be having supper in their palace,

169
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,567
it's only right that they take the best ingredients.

170
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,600
The same thing happened last time.

171
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,500
They had the first pick for the new tribute silks from Suzhou.

172
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:11,467
These are only trivialities, why not let her do as she likes?

 It's hardly a big deal.

173
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,500
The peony flowers outside are looking a little askew,

174
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,000
tell the gardeners to take care of it,
they will bloom again come spring.

175
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,200
Niangniang!

176
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Niangniang's grace nurtures the whole realm,
do you expect her to squabble with Hua Fei over something like that?

177
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,433
Where did Liuzhu go?

178
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:34,433
Have you forgotten, Young Mistress?

179
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,100
You asked our kitchen to make some pastries this morning,

180
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,567
and for Liuzhu to deliver them to Shen Guiren and An Daying.

181
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,367
She left not too long ago.

182
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:45,467
Young Mistress,

183
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,600
Jianqiu Gugu has made a delivery for you by the Empress's orders.

184
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:54,167
She has also invited you to an audience at the Empress's palace in three day's time, 
at the hour of Mao (5:00-7:00AM).

185
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:55,533
I understand.

186
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,400
Also, the Leading Eunuch from Yi Kun Gong (Palace of Wings), Zhou Gonggong,
 is outside, waiting to see you.

187
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,200
Yi Kun Gong?

188
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,600
He comes on Hua Fei Niangniang's behalf.

189
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:09,533
I'll be right there.

190
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:10,367
Understood.

191
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,000
Young Mistress, Hua Fei's authority is not less than that of the Empress's,
you must take care to tread delicately.

192
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,700
Ah.

193
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,700
It's been such a long time since your last visit.

194
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,583
Hm.

195
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,500
This way please.

196
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,400
Your humble servant greets you, Wan Changzai.

197
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,100
Thank you for waiting, Zhou Gonggong.

198
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,800
Hua Fei Niangniang has instructed me to deliver some gifts for you.

199
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,800
I appreciate Niangniang's generosity.

200
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,633
Please convey to Niangniang my gratitude for her.

201
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:48,067
Will Gonggong not have a cup of tea?

202
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,567
Apologies for declining Wan Changzai's kind invitation,

203
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,500
Our Niangniang is very strict with rules,

204
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,800
I still need to deliver the other Young Mistresses' gifts,

205
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:57,867
so I must not tarry.

206
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,600
I thank you for your trouble, Gonggong.

207
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,600
If Young Mistress does not require anything else, 
I shall excuse myself

208
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,133
Congratulations, Young Mistress,

209
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:20,200
Hua Fei Niangniang believes that you have much potential.

210
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,900
I have no use for these right now,

211
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,000
make a record of the gifts and store them in the warehouse for now.

212
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,400
Yes.

213
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,800
So Shen Guiren has received as many gifts as you, Young Mistress.

214
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,100
Only Fucha Guiren and Xia Changzai have received things in Yan Xi Gong
(Palace of Lasting Fortune) where An Daying lives

215
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,600
Hua Fei Niangniang is most likely bestowing her extravagant gifts
according to the Young Mistresses' family backgrounds,

216
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,333
is she intending to recruit people for her camp?

217
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:17,233
Your servant, Jianqiu salutes the Young Mistress.

218
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,100
You came all this way personally?
Please do come in!

219
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:29,667
Empress Niangniang figured

220
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,533
the new Young Mistresses must still be unfamiliar with the forbidden city,

221
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33,800
so she sent me to see if you needed anything.

222
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,533
She also ask me to bring some tributary cloths from Jiangnan's Textile Manufactures

223
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:37,767
for you, Xia Changzai.

224
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,300
The Empress flatters me by sending Gugu personally.

225
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,600
I am so honored.

226
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,433
You are very welcome, I will excuse myself then.

227
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:45,600
Please take care! Gugu.

228
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,967
Here will be fine, Young Mistress.

229
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,200
You shouldn't blame people for passing you over, 
since it is your own origin that is humble.

230
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:10,167
So few rewards? How very pitiful!

231
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:23,300
However extravagant Hua Fei Niangniang's gifts are, 
they can't compare with the Empress Niangniang's!

232
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,600
Tell them to hurry and make a dress with the cloths from the Empress,

233
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,800
I will wear it to the first official audience with the Empress as a symbol of my gratitude for Niangniang.

234
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,600
Yes Mistress.

235
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,300
Young Mistress, don't take her words to heart.

236
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:47,033
I am insignificant. 

Xia Changzai only spoke the truth.

237
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,600
Don't lose hope, Young Mistress. 

A hero is a hero, regardless of how humble his origins.

238
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:59,167
Young Mistress. Chun Changzai is here.

239
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,300
Show her in quick! 
(Cap: Chun Changzai)

240
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,900
Wan Jiejie has been busy the whole day,

241
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:07,100
I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time?

242
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Not at all.

243
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,233
I was planning to visit MeiMei,

244
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:11,667
but MeiMei beat me to it.

245
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,167
Have a seat.

246
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:14,967
Tea. Huanbi

247
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,200
Yes.

248
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:22,000
Today we are serving Puer tea,

249
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,333
I hope you are ok with it?

250
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,433
- Here.
- You have so many delicious pastries!

251
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:30,567
I didn't eat enough at dinner,

252
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,400
why don't we put the tea aside

253
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:33,733
until I have my fill of the sweets,

254
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:35,700
the tea can neutralize the flavor?

255
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,600
Go ahead.

256
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,833
- Liuzhu, bring more pastries. 
- ok!

257
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,167
It tastes so good.

258
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,067
Meimei seems rather young still?

259
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:51,500
No. I am already fourteen!

260
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:57,533
I don't think Meimei likes Puer tea,

261
00:16:57,533 --> 00:17:00,100
Huanbi, bring a cup of milk tea instead.

262
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,367
Yes

263
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:03,233
Thank you, Jiejie. I love everything sweet!

264
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,100
Take it slowly. Don't choke.

265
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:07,899
Please call me Chuner,

266
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:09,567
My parents both call me Chuner. 
 - Ok

267
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,933
Why didn't you eat enough at dinner?

268
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:17,832
I was missing my parents,

269
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,300
The Royal Kitchen served marinated goose for dinner tonight,

270
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,633
it made me think of my mother's marinated goose, the best in the world!

271
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,400
...I lost my appetite after that.

272
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:27,800
From now on if you don't eat enough for dinner,

273
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,000
You can always come to Jiejie's place for pastries.

274
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,733
Is that okay?

275
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,733
Wan Jiejie, you are so good to me!

276
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:38,167
I heard His Majesty likes Jiejie a lot.

277
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,000
I saw how many servants were here this afternoon delivering gifts

278
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:42,533
and knew that it must be true!

279
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:45,700
I just received some fresh flowers.

280
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,700
They are pretty.

281
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,800
If you like them, 

you can take a few home to decorate your hair.

282
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,400
No thanks you...

283
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:54,367
I think I like the pastries more.

284
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,433
Eat up if you like them!

285
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:01,267
Huanbi. Pack some pastries up

286
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:02,667
so Chun Changzai can bring them back with her.

287
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,700
Thank you! Jie Jie.

288
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,533
<i> Jiangnan's lotus flowers are ripe for the picking.
(based on traditional, lotus picking poetry from the Han dynasty)</i>

289
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:20,433
The Royal Garden is as beautiful as expected.
 Every detail is exquisite.

290
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,667
Commoners are indeed common,

291
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:28,833
can't even be quiet when embroidering.
(suggesting that singing is an art used for seduction, indecency)

292
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,700
During the first three days 

we are not allowed to serve His Majesty at night,

293
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,800
but just imagine when we will be allowed,
she'll be jumping into His Majesty's bed.

294
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:37,367
I was humming subconciously

295
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,967
If Changzai does not like it, I will stop.

296
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:42,533
Stop acting like a victim,

297
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:43,700
who are you trying to show?

298
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,700
I am not.

299
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,833
You haven't had the chance to meet His Majesty yet,

300
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,967
but take care when you do,

301
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,900
I won't let you off easy if you use the coquette act to tempt His majesty!

302
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:01,633
She is always like that

303
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:03,333
Who does she think she is.

304
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,633
Young Mistress, don't get upset over what she says.

305
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:12,633
Forget about it. If she is here, then I will go elsewhere.

306
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:18,133
Accompany me to see two Jiejies. 
-Yes.

307
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,000
It smells really good.

308
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,700
Doesn't it?

309
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,500
Let me pick another.

310
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,700
Here you are. Quick, come inside.

311
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Why didn't you announce Young Mistress An's arrival?

312
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,700
keeping her standing there in the sun.

313
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,200
If she gets sunburns or a heatstroke you'd better watch your hide!

314
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,600
Don't blame him, Jiejie. 

 I asked him to not announce me.

315
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:44,433
I meant to give you a surprise,

316
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,200
but instead I've irritated you.

317
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,800
It's all Lingrong's fault.

318
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,300
Your intentions were good, 

 what fault could u have?

319
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,300
It's all your fault for scaring An Meimei.

320
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,600
Hurry up, show her in 

and serve her a cup of tea to ask for her forgiveness.

321
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Exactly. Come on in!

322
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,300
I went to Xian Fu Gong to see Mei Jiejie just now,

323
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,067
in the hopes that we could come visit Zhen Jiejie together,

324
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:06,400
but Jiejie beat me here first.

325
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,667
I ended up being one step behind after all.

326
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,000
You are not late at all,

327
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,700
We can all chat for a while.

328
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,200
The mistress of the palace I live in now, Jin (Respect) Pin Niangniang,

329
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:17,467
is tremendously easy to get along with.

330
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,000
How about you?

331
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:23,833
I'm...fine, more or less.

332
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:27,467
Fucha Guiren does not seem the sort who likes looking for trouble,

333
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:30,367
but Xia Changzai...

334
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,800
I'll just ignore her.

335
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,900
I will only talk to Jiejies.

336
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,000
Then Young Mistress An, please visit here more often.

337
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,600
I know Young mistress does not like Liuan Tea,

338
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,700
So I switched your tea to XIang Pian tea.

339
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,100
I have troubled Huanbi to remember the little details about me
from the time that I stayed at your manor.

340
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:52,567
The two Young Mistresses are like family to my Young Mistress,

341
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,667
it's only right that I pay attention to your preferences.

342
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,433
I thought LIuzhu was the quick one,

343
00:20:56,433 --> 00:21:00,000
turns out Huanbi has an even sweeter mouth

 and an even better eye for detail.

344
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,967
Huanbi has served me for a long time

345
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:03,933
she naturally remembers many details.

346
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,300
Of course. Those who have been with us since youth are naturally better,

347
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,800
I also brought Caiyue and Caixing with me.

348
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,200
Speaking of which, you didn't bring any servants with you into the Palace.

349
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:19,200
Are the palace servants appointed to you to your liking?

350
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,500
Baojuan is smart, she is quite reliable.

351
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,300
The other two are still young, not more older than fifteen years of age.

352
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,533
I don't expect them to do too much.

353
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:31,533
But it's alright, I have never been one for too much trouble,

354
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:33,033
so there is nothing to worry about.

355
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:35,067
Jinxi!

356
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:40,200
- Here. 
- Go inform Empress Niangniang.

357
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,400
I would like to have Juqing moved to Yan Xi Gong to serve Young Mistress An.

358
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,200
Yes, I understand.

359
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,033
Juqing may be young, but she is quite reliable.

360
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,700
Take her with you when you leave.

361
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,300
If you need anything else,

362
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:54,133
don't hesitate to let me or Mei Jiejie know.

363
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:55,733
Thanks you very much. Jie jie

364
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:57,767
I received some new silk today,

365
00:21:57,767 --> 00:21:59,067
I think they will suit you.

366
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:02,267
I will ask Caiyue to deliver them to Yan Xi Gong.

367
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:04,800
The two of you are so kind to me,

368
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:07,533
I can never repay my debt to you.

369
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,300
I am endless grateful for everything you have done for me.

370
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,967
The three of us came together to the Palace,

371
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:20,300
we are most acquainted with each other out of everyone here,

372
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,667
we should look out for each other, no thanks needed.

373
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,133
Today is Young Mistress's first official audience with the Empress,

374
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,400
you should dress up so that you can stand out.

375
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,300
Fetch some warm water for me outside,

376
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:02,900
Huanbi can help me here.

377
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,000
Understood.

378
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:13,367
Do an ordinary bun.

379
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:14,533
Yes

380
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:22,200
Niangniang, it's time to go to Jing Ren Gong (Palace of Benelovent Hope).

381
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,833
It won't do to be late today...

382
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:27,233
No hurry.

383
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:29,633
Niangniang is always so original,

384
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:31,867
this hairstyle is especially pleasing to the eye,

385
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:33,167
artful but natural.

386
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:35,600
Let's go

387
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,400
Meimei, you are all so early today.

388
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,200
Have you adapted to life in the Palace?

389
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,500
Thanks to your care and concern,

we are doing well.

390
00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:51,733
I'm not late, am I?

391
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:56,367
Greetings, Hua Fei Niangniang

392
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:04,533
Greetings, Empress. 
- Please rise, Meimei

393
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,767
Hua Fei meimei came so late,

394
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:13,300
are you feeling unwell?

395
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,300
His Majesty was going over the official reports til late last night,

396
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:19,000
so I stayed up also to keep him company.

397
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,600
Then this morning His Majesty refused to let me rise early.

398
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,833
So I came late.

399
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,433
I hope Empress Niangniang is not mad?

400
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:31,200
His Majesty has been busy with state affairs lately

401
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,167
so He may have neglected you for a while.

402
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,033
Naturally He would want to make it up to you.

403
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:38,000
Today we are meeting the new Meimei,

404
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,433
from now on, we will have new companions.

405
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:49,833
Who does Hua Fei think she is showing off to?

406
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:59,333
The Young Mistresses will perform the formal salutation to Empress Niangniang. 
(Cap: Jiang Fu Hai)

407
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,300
(Consisting of three kneels and nine kowtow.)

408
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:17,164
(For the women the handkerchief over shoulder movement
represents the kowtow.)

409
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,300
Blessings, Empress niangniang.

410
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,900
All rise.

411
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,433
Thank you. Empress Niangniang.

412
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:40,500
Meet the other consorts as well.

413
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,267
Duan ï¼ˆRegularity/Modesty) Fei is unwell,

414
00:25:43,267 --> 00:25:46,933
Young Mistresses will not be seeing her today.

415
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:49,233
Duan Fei has been unwell for a very long time,

416
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:52,667
Do visit her on my behalf, Jianqiu, when the ceremony is over.

417
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,233
Yes. Niangniang

418
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:58,167
All Mistresses salute Hua Fei Niangniang.

419
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,567
Blessings, Hua Fei Niangniang.

420
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:09,167
The jadeite that the Internal Affairs Authority sent me this year is not as pure,

421
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,067
not at all clear and transparent.

422
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:15,033
Quality jadeite is getting harder to come by nowadays.

423
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:17,933
Meimei is still young, jadeite's color is too dark at your age,

424
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
so the Internal Affairs Authority selected some lighter colored ones for you.

425
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:25,300
But then again, if you don't have high quality jadeite Meimei,

426
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,700
how can anyone else have anything better?

427
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,767
I suppose so, I do feel that jadeite is a little too old for me.

428
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:34,400
I don't deserve to wear them yet,

429
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,133
If Niangniang likes them,

430
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:41,533
I can give Niangniang the pair of earrings I'm wearing right now.

431
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:44,100
I recently received a pair of eastern pearls and

432
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,267
have just asked the craftsmen to make a pair of earrings with them.

433
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,300
It would be too wasteful if I accept your pair as well.

434
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,833
His Majesty would disapprove if he hears of it.

435
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,633
Empress Niangniang is truly frugal.

436
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,500
Why don't we let the Meimei rise first?

437
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:10,100
Oh no, I was so absorbed talking to Empress Niangniang.

 I almost forgot you were all still kneeling.

438
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:12,167
Rise

439
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:14,633
Thank you Hua Fei Niangniang.

440
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,300
I heard there was a very talented Xia Changzai.

441
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,333
Blessings, Hua Fei Niangniang.

442
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,700
I am the Changzai of the family name Xia.

443
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,400
Xia Changzai sure is well attired,

444
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:30,633
that material you are wearing looks expensive?

445
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,800
This was a gift from Empress Niangniang.

446
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:40,367
I picked it specifically for today's occasion.

447
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:45,433
You understand the concept of gratitude, 

not bad.

448
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:46,633
Rise

449
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:48,167
Thank you, Hua Fei Niangniang.

450
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,500
And which of you is Shen Guiren and Wan Changzai?

451
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,900
I am Guiren Shen Meizhuang from Xian Fu Gong (Palace of Whole Blessings).
My respectful regards for Hua Fei Niangniang.

452
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,667
I am Changzai Zhen Huan from Sui Yu Xuan (Pavilion of Jade Fragments),
my respectful regards for Hua Fei Niangniang.

453
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,200
How elegant you are, Shen Guiren.

454
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,500
And Wan Changzai, your beauty is still visible, though you are dressed plainly.

455
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,100
His Majesty truly has good taste.

456
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,933
Everyone of you is outstanding.

457
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,600
Alright, rise.

458
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,200
Thank you, Hua Fei Niangniang.

459
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,000
Niangniang's beauty is the true beauty of an empire, 

 you are the truly eye-catching one.

460
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,900
We are but like dim fireflies in the glowing light of your pearl-like beauty, 

we would not dare to compete.

461
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,200
Shen Meimei has a very sweet mouth.

462
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,800
Although...the beauty of an empire...

463
00:28:44,033 --> 00:28:47,400
isn't that a phrase for describing the Empress Niangniang?

464
00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:54,033
Empress Niangniang's brilliant grace nurtures the land, 

like the bright moon overhead.

465
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,500
Hua Fei Niangniang's glorious beauty overwhelms

like a pearl shining.

466
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,800
We are but dust compared to you.

467
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:09,933
More and more clever tongues are joining the Harem.

468
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,233
Naturally, all of the Meimei are smart and capable.

469
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:18,033
From now on, we will all live together in the Harem.

470
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,400
Your first duty is to serve His Majesty wholeheartedly,
and add children to the Imperial Family.

471
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,100
Then of course, you must live harmoniously with each other,
and never be tempted into jealousy,

472
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,500
for it would trouble His Majesty.

473
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,900
Understood.

474
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,700
Jiang Fuhai, what did the Empress Dowager say?

475
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,900
Empress Dowager Niangniang said it's a joyful thing

 to have the new Young Mistresses.

476
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:40,300
And that she is conscious of your kind intentions,

477
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,167
but as she is preoccupied with meditating on the Buddha's teachings,

478
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,600
it will not be necessary for Niangniang and the Young Mistresses
to pay their formal respects at Shou Kang Gong.

479
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:47,867
I see.

480
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:50,967
You all must be tired, you may take your leave now.

481
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:55,333
Yes. Excuse us.

482
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:13,400
Jiejies, you have such smooth tongues!

483
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,500
Fawning over Hua Fei after flattering the Empress,

484
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,900
such a splendid performance!

485
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,900
Quite admirable. Bravo!

486
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:25,967
Greetings, Xia Changzai.

487
00:30:30,267 --> 00:30:34,767
Jiejie, your servants have their hands full with your rewards,

488
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:37,367
do you even have enough room in your palaces for them?

489
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:41,500
We are all sisters, 

we all share equally in the Imperial blessings.

490
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,100
I was just thinking of selecting some choice pieces

491
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,500
to deliver to each of you after I return to my residence.

492
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,900
But since you are already here,

493
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,100
please, pick something you like.

494
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,500
Please pick something Xia Changzai.

495
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,933
There's no shortage of these toys in my family,

496
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:08,067
But Shen Guiren sure seems an expert at purchasing favors with small gifts like these.

497
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,600
How did someone like HER get into the Harem?
What an insipid girl.

498
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,300
The Xia family are lower than the servants at Nian manor.

499
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,200
I heard that she has been pestering Fucha Guiren everyday 
in their own palace these past few days,

500
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,800
and bullying An Daying at every chance besides.
There is absolutely no peace to be had there because of her.

501
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,300
Look at her dress.

502
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,400
She thinks that she can strut around like she owns the place
just because she has the Empress's support?

503
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,900
I heard Xia jiejie comes from a family of warriors,

504
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,400
I admire you very much.

505
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,800
My family has served in the military generation after generation,

506
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,300
Loyal to the country

507
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,400
How can a county magistrate even hope to compare with us?

508
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,200
What happened on the day of the audition was purely an accident,
I had no intention of offending you.

509
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:59,300
I have not stopped thinking about it ever since, 
I regret my mistake endlessly.

510
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,800
It's just... since you come from a military family,

511
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:05,667
You must excel in both mental and physical strength.

512
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,900
As expected Jiejie, you are fearless and bold,

513
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,033
you truly live up to your family's name.

514
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:12,733
I'm only a product of my family's good principles.

515
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,200
Such stupidity actually exists in the world.

516
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,700
And she is a Changzai (lingering)...

517
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:22,800
I guess she's the lingering laughing stock.

518
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:25,133
Yes

519
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,100
She is a concubine just as you are! 

You can't hit her!

520
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,800
Let me go!

521
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,433
Greetings, Hua Fei Niangniang.

522
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:56,367
Hua Fei Niangniang...

523
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,800
- Zhou Ninghai Let her go.
- Yes

524
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,500
The Royal Garden during fall is as beautiful as a painting,

525
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,600
but such splendid scenery is ruined by imbeciles.

526
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,400
How disappointing

527
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,300
An Daying insulted me,

528
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,300
I only wanted to teach her a lesson.

529
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,500
A lesson...

530
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,500
Are the Empress and I no longer present in the Harem?

531
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,900
I hadn't heard that the Harem is now Xia Changza's possession...

532
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,700
or that we must trouble you to teach other concubine "lessons"...

533
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,400
I fear that you can't shoulder such a difficult burden...

534
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,600
The maples this year do not quite look red enough.

535
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,100
I have heard that maple dyed in blood is an exquisite shade of red.

536
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,200
Is that so?

537
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,400
Then reward Xia Changzai with "A Zhang of Redness"
 (Zhang is a measure of length, =3.33 meters)

538
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,100
Let her blood add some hue to the maples

539
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,400
A Zhang of Redness?

540
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,867
Replying to your question, young mistress

541
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,100
A Zhang of Redness is a kind of punishment in the Harem.

542
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,400
The subject is beaten with a wooden board that is 
2 cun thick and 6 chi long, (Cun=3.33cm Chi=33.3cm)

543
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,300
below the waist, until bone and tendon are broken

 and the flesh severely mutilated.

544
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,600
It will look like a patch of pure red from a distance,
a dazzling sight.

545
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,100
That is why it's called A Zhang of Redness.

546
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,000
Young Mistress. This way please.

547
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,300
Hua Fei Niangniang, please have mercy!

548
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,000
Hua Fei Niangniang I will never do it again!

549
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,900
Please forgive me!

550
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:31,700
Young Mistress, it would be a huge honor if your blood really
color the maples as the rumors say!

551
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,200
Hua Fei Niangniang, have mercy!

552
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,100
Guards, take her to the Shen Xing Si (Bureau of Caution and Punishment).

553
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,000
Please forgive me,

554
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,000
Hua Fei Niangniang...Hua Fei Niangniang!

555
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,600
Please forgive me, Hua Fei Niangniang!

556
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,400
Xia disrespected her superiors and caused disorder in the Harem.

557
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Meimeis must be startled.

558
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,600
Although it is said...punish by example, not by number,

559
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,300
but the whole affair still originated with the three of you.

560
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,100
Xia dug her own grave,

561
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,000
but you three are not the guileless type either.

562
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,600
Reflect on your own actions in solitude.

563
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,567
I almost died of fright!

564
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,900
Xia was stupid and arrogant, 

but that sentence was too much!

565
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,500
I'd always heard that Hua Fei was harsh, 

but I never imagined her to be this perverse.

566
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,200
Hua Fei told us to go and reflect...

567
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,300
This...

568
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,900
It's only reflecting, don't be afraid.

569
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,500
Jiejie, let's return to our palaces. I'm scared!

570
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,800
Let's go back.

571
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
What's going on?

572
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,100
What happened?

573
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,900
There's a... a...

574
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,800
Calm down, speak properly! Don't go around frightening people!

575
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,400
Yes

576
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,800
Young Mistress, I am with the Office in charge of maintaining the Royal Garden.

577
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,300
I came to check if the wells in the garden all had water, as according to my duty,

578
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,900
But as soon as I got here...
I never thought...!

579
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,600
In the well...there was...!

580
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,100
I will check it out.

581
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,200
No, don't go! There might be something inauspicious.

582
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
Relax. I will come right back.

583
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,200
What's wrong? What's wrong?!

584
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,500
Don't go there. There is a dead person.

585
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,200
What...?

586
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,400
Replying to your inquiry, the dead girl is Fuzi

587
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,300
She was found in a well.

588
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,600
Fuzi?

589
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,400
How did she end up in a well for no reason?

590
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,900
I do not know.

591
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,100
It was a remote place, people seldom passed by.

592
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,300
Of course you wouldn't know,

593
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Fuzi was the servant I appointed to serve Hua Fei.

594
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,300
You may rise.

595
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,700
Then I will make some inquiries at Hua Fei's palace.

596
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
I have one more thing to report,

597
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,700
Speak.

598
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,500
Hua Fei Niangniang has punished Xia Changzai...

599
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,800
with A Zhang of Redness.

600
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,900
Xia habitually overstepped her bounds, leave her be.

601
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,100
But Fuzi was pitifully innocent...

602
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,700
she died for nothing.

603
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,800
She was still a child.

604
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,100
I didn't find her on Long Street either!

605
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,800
Alright, go go go.

606
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,400
Young Mistress, where did you go off to?
We couldn't find you anywhere!

607
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,000
Why do you look so pale?

608
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,300
Sit down, sit down!

609
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,200
Young Mistress, Jiang Fuhai was just here to deliver the Empress's indictment;

610
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,800
starting tomorrow,

611
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,700
the new mistresses are to get ready to serve His Majesty.

612
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,500
Congratulations, Young mistress,

613
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,200
Our Young Mistress will surely be His Majesty's favorite.

614
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,400
Young Mistress won't necessarily be called on to serve tomorrow,

615
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,900
but you should still start preparing for when the time comes.

616
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,300
Young Mistress, you haven't eaten anything yet, have you?

617
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,300
You must be hungry. Hurry, tell them to bring in the meal.

618
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,200
No...that won't be necessary.

619
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,200
I have no appetite.

620
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,900
Then bring the meal later. We will help her in first.

621
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,300
Niangniang, Jiang Fuhai is here.

622
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,300
He said he has some questions for you from the Empress.

623
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,100
Let him in.

624
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,200
Yes.

625
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,900
Greetings, Niangniang.

626
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,000
You may rise.

627
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,600
It's good that you're here, 

I have something to ask you.

628
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,400
Yes

629
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,900
What's that Fuzi's background?

630
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
I can't even scold her?

631
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,800
She is nothing more than a servant, she has no background.
Niangniang you are joking with me.

632
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
A joke you say?

633
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,500
All right, then I will tell you a joke.

634
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:28,700
Did Fuzi make it her mission to antagonize me, 
thinking that she had the Empress's support?

635
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,900
Fuzi is newly selected by Internal Affairs Authority

636
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,200
Empress Niangniang had only had her for a few days 

before she came to serve you Niangniang.

637
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,600
There is no talk of her having the Empress's support.

638
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:42,700
The other day her clumsiness hurt me while she was brushing my hair.

639
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,600
I only scolded her a little bit

640
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,100
before she ran out in a noisy, crying flurry.
She hasn't returned even now!

641
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,000
I thought

642
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,300
that's how the Empress disciplines her servants...

643
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,000
Niang niang. Fuzi is dead.

644
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:00,333
Dead?

645
00:40:02,023 --> 00:40:06,317
