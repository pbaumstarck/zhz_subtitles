4
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:08,971
Niangniang, Fuzi is already dead.

5
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:10,420
Dead?

6
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,980
How could she be dead?

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,417
When did this happen?

8
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,167
She was just retrieved from a well.

9
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:20,257
Her body is badly swollen.

10
00:00:20,257 --> 00:00:23,287
You are in Niangniang's presence. How could you speak so freely of such things?

11
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:25,168
No matter.

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,400
It must have been the day you scolded her.

13
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:28,799
She ran out crying.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,200
She was not watching her steps, so she must have fallen accidentally into the well.

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,800
So, it's my fault then?

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,600
That can't be,

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,300
it's all Fuzi's fault for having such a bad temper.

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,100
How can any servant not get an occasional scolding,

19
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,000
don't you agree, Jiang Fuhai?

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,500
This...your servant dare not comment.

21
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,400
What do you mean "I don't dare"?

22
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,900
If you won't believe me, then feel free to ask anyone serving at Yi Kun Gong (Palace of Wings).

23
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,900
Everyone saw her run out by herself.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,900
Do you mean, Gonggong...

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,300
that someone pushed her from behind?

26
00:01:00,642 --> 00:01:01,733
I would never dare to make such an assumption.

27
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:03,516
There is nothing you won't dare to do.

28
00:01:03,516 --> 00:01:04,900
If you don't believe me,

29
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,303
then cross examine every single person from my palace.

30
00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:09,900
Niangniang, it has not come to that.

31
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,640
But let me make one thing clear,

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,558
you came today by order of the Empress.

33
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:19,100
You asked what you had to ask, I answered, 

 and have witnesses to support my answer.

34
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,000
If you want to take anyone into custody, be my guest.

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,000
Otherwise, if you dare to bother me about this matter again,

36
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,100
don't expect me to be generous.

37
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:31,867
Excuse me, my Lady

38
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,033
Remember, all of you, this is what happened.

39
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:51,600
Fuzi ran out on her own free will

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,633
She misstepped and fell into the well, where she drowned.

41
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:56,267
Yes.

42
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:05,333
It smells so good. my lady.

43
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:11,400
Young Mistress had a bad fright yesterday,

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,933
she didn't have an appetite at lunch nor dinner yesterday.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,800
At least eat something this morning?

46
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
It would be alright if it was only a one-time shock,

47
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:24,167
I'm only afraid that I will have to live with similar horrors from now on.

48
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,600
Why?

49
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,533
Xia Changzai picked a fight with us,

50
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:32,100
Meizhuang and I have evidently made many enemies.

51
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,200
Hua Fei is forceful, her methods are cruel.

52
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,600
Being so surrounded by enemies,
I fear for not only my own safety,

53
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,967
but once I make one wrong move

54
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,600
I fear that my whole clan will have to suffer for it.

55
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,800
What should we do?

56
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,600
I don't know yet.

57
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,000
Young Mistress, do you remember when we
made osmanthus candy at home?

58
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,800
These osmanthus are blooming beautifully,

59
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,100
How about I make some candies with them?

60
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,000
What do you say?

61
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,500
Your culinary skills are impeccable,

62
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,000
I will eat some if you make any

63
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,300
Okay!

64
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,300
I'll go get some help!

65
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,233
Pei Er, what are you looking at that's so interesting?

66
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,200
Look Young Mistress, the ants are moving in a weird pattern.

67
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,533
The ants are avoiding the tree root,

68
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,767
as if they are afraid.

69
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,900
Well I think the ants are just stupid,

70
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,000
taking the far way.

71
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,400
Xiao Yun zi, come here.

72
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,300
Dig up the spot where all the ants are avoiding.

73
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:19,633
What is this. Buried so deeply

74
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Mistress, there is a jar here. 
- Dig it up, let's have a look.

75
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,655
What is it?

76
00:04:28,655 --> 00:04:29,200
Pull harder.

77
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:32,533
Here. Let me see.

78
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:33,967
Back off.

79
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:43,967
This jar is very odd, it has a strong fragrance.

80
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,900
Sui Yu Xuan used to be Fang Guiren's residence,

81
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,900
after her miscarriage she was banished to the Cold Palace.

82
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,100
But she still enjoyed His Majesty's adoration once,

83
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,100
what if there's some kind of rare perfume in it?

84
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:04,782
Our mistress likes perfumes, why not open it up and see?

85
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,300
Open it!

86
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:11,574
Let me see.

87
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,925
Open it up.

88
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,751
What is it? Such an irritating smell!

89
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:21,240
It stinks!

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,479
It's nothing but some cheap spices.

91
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,733
Huanbi, cover it up

92
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,800
You all are to keep your mouths shut
about what we dug up today.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We don't need any idle gossip.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,533
Yes, yes.

95
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,300
Make the osmanthus candy tomorrow instead.

96
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,900
You can all go!

97
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,133
Go back to your duties.

98
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,933
Huanbi. Let's go inside

99
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:45,533
Take it away

100
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,000
Mistress, what's going on?

101
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,800
Why do you so pale?

102
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:57,533
I feel very unsettled.

103
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:03,167
Huanbi, go find Docter Wen, ask him to come see me.

104
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:07,790
Remember, it has to be Docter Wen. 
- Okay.

105
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:30,067
Docter Wen. I'm glad you are here.

106
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,067
My mistress does not feel well

107
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:34,867
can you please check on her?

108
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,067
Is she all right?

109
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:39,267
Either way, she insisted on asking you to take a look.

110
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:41,400
Please hurry.

111
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:58,133
Young Mistress, you seem to have had a very serious fright?

112
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,300
I saw something I shouldn't have seen.

113
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,100
Then you have to find a way to forget about what you saw.

114
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:15,100
That day, what you said outside the Palace,
do you still stand by your promise?

115
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,000
Of course. I will forever place you above everything else.

116
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,000
"Forever"...is easily said,

117
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,800
but...not so easily done.

118
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,300
I know I don't have many merits,

119
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,100
but I always do my best to keep my word.

120
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,300
I will forever remember the debt owed to the Zhen family by my father.

121
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,267
Young Mistress, command me as you will.

122
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:00,533
I don't want to serve His Majesty in bed.

123
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,700
I don't want that to happen either,

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,500
but Young Mistress is already in the Harem,

125
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,900
sooner or later you will need to accompany His Majesty in slumber.

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,800
It would be advisable, for the sake of your future,
that you do so as early as possible.

127
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,200
But I can't help but be afraid,

128
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:25,367
if I serve him right now...

129
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:29,000
Docter Wen, I have something to show you.

130
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:42,400
Why do you have this Young Mistress?

131
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,100
The cherry-apple tree in Sui Yu Xuan.

132
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Flowers have not bloomed this spring.

133
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:53,600
I dug that up from under the tree today by chance.

134
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,400
The Fang Guiren who used to live here had an unexplained miscarriage,

135
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,000
I suppose the real cause is that, or something like it.

136
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,267
It's apparent how much scheming goes around in this Harem.

137
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:11,033
Fang Guiren most likely doesn't know, even now, just what caused her downfall.

138
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,700
It's fortunate that you discovered this early,

139
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,000
otherwise, all the ladies who live in Sui Yu Xuan would have suffered the consequences.

140
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,700
I know I don't have the privilege of being your companion for life,

141
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,700
but if I can protect and keep you safe through the years,
then it is another way to honor my promise to you.

142
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,033
Is my condition serious?

143
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,300
Fear is the reason for your high temperature,
you must first calm your nerves.

144
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,500
If treated with care, you can recover in half a month.

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,100
But if you would like to be...extra cautious with your recovery,

146
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,200
then I will prescribe something that will allow you more time to make a recovery.

147
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:57,467
This kernel of musk is the strongest component of musk.

148
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,900
It would be best for Young Mistress to have no contact with it.
Let me take it instead,

149
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,100
I will use it as medicine, so that atonement can be found for the life that it took.

150
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:10,967
Doctor Wen. I am so scared.

151
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:14,633
Don't be.

152
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:22,167
Liuzhu, see Docter Wen out.

153
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,400
Wan Changzai has fallen sick? She was fine yesterday.

154
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,000
Wan Changzai is under an evil influence which,

155
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,900
combined with stress from a serious shock, has induced flu symptoms.

156
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,600
A shock?

157
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,500
Yes, she has suffered an excessive fright.

158
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,600
Right now she has a fever, and keeps muttering unintelligibly.

159
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,400
If that's the case then Chun Changzai should move away from Sui Yu Xuan for the time being, 
to avoid the disease.

160
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,733
Yes. It's a dangerous season right now.

161
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:00,400
Wan Changzai's illness is caused by both internal and external factors,

162
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,167
I fear that should the other Young Mistresses be infected...

163
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:07,033
Then... 
- So let Chun Changzai move.

164
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,800
Since you diagnosed Wan Changzai

165
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,967
and since she won't make a full recovery for quite a while,

166
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:13,933
why don't you continue tending to her illness.

167
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,500
I will do my best.

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,200
Starting today the new concubines will be available to serve Your Majesty,

169
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,500
do you still plan to visit Hua Fei's palace?

170
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:28,600
Are you prying into my thoughts?

171
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't dare to pry into your thoughts.

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,400
Please flip a nameboard instead.

173
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,100
Please flip a nameboard over, Your Majesty

174
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,233
Where is Wan Changzai's nameboard?

175
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:55,733
To reply to your inquiry

176
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:58,567
this afternoon, the Royal Clinic sent someone to report

177
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:04,200
that Wan Changzai has had a serious shock, 

which triggered the flu. 
She needs to rest to make a recovery.

178
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,367
A shock?

179
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:09,733
Hua Fei gave Xia Changzai A Zhang of Redness

180
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:12,467
in front of Shen Guiren, Wan Changzai, and An Guiren.

181
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:15,800
Xia Changzai is already...paralyzed from the waist down.

182
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,100
What did she do?

183
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,133
Xia Changzai disrespectful etiquette,

184
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:21,133
she intended to hit another concubine.

185
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,900
But still, Hua Fei was too harsh.

186
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,500
She meant to use violence in the Palace, that needs to be punished.

187
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:28,300
Pay no more heed to her.

188
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,900
One of Hua Fei's servants, Fuzi, was found inexplicably dead in a well.

189
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,000
Wan Changzai chanced upon the event and saw the body.

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,533
Inexplicably?

191
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:38,500
What did Hua Fei say?

192
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,867
She said it was an accident,

193
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:44,167
but Jiang Fuhai thinks that there is something amiss.

194
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:50,867
Maids are at least from families belonging to the Eight Banners.

195
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:53,100
Hua Fei...

196
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,100
Look into this case. 
-Yes

197
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:00,667
Wan Changzai is sick

198
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:04,033
but Shen Guiren and An Daying are still healthy.

199
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:13,367
Congratulations Shen Guiren.

200
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:20,233
Tonight, his majesty flipped your nameboard

201
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,367
You are the first one,

202
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:26,133
Among all the new young mistresses

203
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:29,000
Thank you, Gong gong. Cai Yue.

204
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,733
Thank you Gong Gong. <br />You don't have to thank me

205
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:36,833
Young mistress, please get ready

206
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,252
for His Majesty's visit.

207
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,200
But... What should I...

208
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,100
Oh yes. This here is Liu Momo

209
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:48,567
She,

210
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:51,800
Will tell you what you should do.

211
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,267
Later, the Grace Carriage will come here to pick you up

 and drop you off at the Hall of a Resting Soul.

212
00:13:57,267 --> 00:14:01,833
Young mistress, take care!

213
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,700
Excuse me

214
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,100
Good bye, Gonggong.

215
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,033
Your Majesty, Shen Guiren is here.

216
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:15,967
Carry her in

217
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:51,100
Your Majesty.

218
00:14:56,633 --> 00:15:00,533
His Majesty learnt that you like chrysanthemums so he sent you all of these. 
He really has you on his mind.

219
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:06,033
What other flowers are there during the fall?
 You are thinking too much.

220
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:08,667
It's true. You are His Majesty's favorite.

221
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,667
It's been a month since new mistresses entered the Harem,

222
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,433
His Majesty hasn't visited any of the new Daying,

223
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,600
and He is indifferent to the rest of the new Young Mistresses.

224
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,500
But he really likes you.

225
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,167
Not only has He summoned you the most at night, 
He has also given you the most rewards.

226
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:22,000
What are you saying in broad daylight!

227
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:26,967
The white ones are Snow on a Sunny Spring Day,

228
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,867
The yellow ones are called Dragon Above the Clouds.

229
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:30,433
And that one, two blossoms on the same stem.

230
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:32,333
Just like His Majesty and Young Mistress!

231
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,800
You naughty girl.

232
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,633
The Emperor arrives!

233
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,833
Greetings, Your Majesty.

234
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,300
What were you talking about? Laughing so merrily.
Let me hear it too.

235
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,167
-Rise.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

236
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:50,433
Do you like the flowers?

237
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:54,500
Yesterday I passed by the greenhouse and saw them in full bloom

238
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,367
so I told them to send you some.

239
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:59,267
I like them very much. Thank you, Your Majesty.

240
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,400
Replying to Your Majesty's inquiry, our Young Mistress really likes chrysanthemums.

241
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,500
So she's especially grateful for them Your Majesty.

242
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,200
I can see that. Your dress also has chrysanthemums embroidered on it.

243
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:12,767
Why do you like them?

244
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:15,367
They would rather die on the stem with scent still intact,

245
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,800
than be blown away into the sky by cold winds.

246
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,400
I like them because they symbolize honor and integrity.

247
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,800
You are well read.

248
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,300
I did not mean to show off Your Majesty, please forgive my slip.

249
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,300
I like that you are well read, knowledge can impart sense.

250
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,400
Chrysanthemums are symbols of honor and integrity,

251
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,200
but the reason I like them is because they alone belong to the fall.
They do not vie for attention like the others.

252
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:46,733
Only by enduring loneliness, can someone enjoy constancy.

253
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,700
Thanks for your advice.

254
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:51,700
If you like them,

255
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,200
I will ask them to pick out the most beautiful ones for your palace.

256
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,700
I heard there are green chrysanthemums in the greenhouse right now,

257
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,900
they took quite a while to cultivate.
You can have all of them.

258
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

259
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
The name of your residence...
(Chang Xi Tang; Hall of Perpetual Luminance)

260
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,100
sounds like the name of an old schoolroom, not an ounce of romance.

261
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,400
Since you like chrysanthemums, 
let it be called Cun Ju Tang (Hall where Chrysanthemums are stored).

262
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,100
I came today because I have a plan to share with you.

263
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:40,000
I want you to start learning about household management.

264
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,500
Some small, troublesome details,

265
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,100
notice them, give them some thought.
Learn as much as you can.

266
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:47,867
But I don't know any of these things.

267
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,800
Then you should try to learn.

268
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,033
You are smart. And you always consider the general interest.

269
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:55,367
I know that and I like it.

270
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:58,167
That's why I came here to remind you.

271
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:02,367
Managing the Harem is just like managing a family.

272
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:06,200
Pay more attention. And then you will learn how to do it gradually

273
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Yes. I would love to give it a try

274
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
That's it.

275
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,267
As long as you put time and effort in it. everything will be easy to learn

276
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:19,867
Empress always feel sick.

277
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:24,033
Hua Fei is aggressive and impatient.

278
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:26,033
What I like about you is you are composed.

279
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:28,200
Learn more.

280
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,667
Then you can help me manage the Harem

281
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,167
Young mistress, Jianqiu Gugu is here.

282
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,033
Jianqiu saluting to you, Young Mistress.

283
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,200
Don't move.

284
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,367
Gugu, what brings you here.

285
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:51,367
How would I deserve your visit.

286
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:54,300
The Empress heard that 

 the Young Mistress is still unwell.

287
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,100
She is really worried

288
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,033
so she sent me to check on you.

289
00:18:58,033 --> 00:19:00,500
Many thanks for the Empress's concern.

290
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,633
Why is the Young Mistress so skinny?

291
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:04,133
What did the Imperial Physician say?

292
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:06,600
Young Mistress, it's time for your medicine.

293
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,833
Young Mistress.

294
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,000
Our Young Mistress is frail, and she had a big scare.

295
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,800
She drinks the Imperial Physician's medicine three times a day,

296
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,033
but she is not getting any better.

297
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:43,500
The sickness of the body is easily cured,

298
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,833
but the sickness of the heart needs medicines for the heart.

299
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,100
Also, Xia Changzai's legs are now crippled.

300
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,300
The Imperial Physician said that she will live,

301
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,700
but she can no longer walk.

302
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,000
Hua Fei said that her living in the Palace of Lasting Fortune is now an inconvenience.

303
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:58,400
So she was moved to the Cold Palace.

304
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,267
It's a pity,

305
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,500
but it's her fault for not meeting the expectations

306
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,167
and also for harming you, Young Mistress.

307
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:09,367
I was cowardly. It was not Xia Changzai's fault.

308
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:11,067
Of course it was not Xia Changzai's fault.

309
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:13,533
But it is an unfortunate time for you to fall ill, Young Mistress.

310
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:16,167
Now Shen Guiren has an advantage.

311
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:18,167
She got the favour first.

312
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:20,667
I have no fortune,

313
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:23,200
unlike Shen Guiren.

314
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,167
It's my fault,

315
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:29,000
If I make Niang Niang worried

316
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,700
Please rest.

317
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,267
I'm returning to Palace of Benelovent Hope

318
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:34,600
I will visit you sometime in the future

319
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,333
Kang GongGong

320
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,933
Please walk gugu out.

321
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:42,500
Excuse me

322
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:50,867
That Wan Changzai is so beautiful.

323
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:52,967
But I didn't expect her to be such a coward

324
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:56,333
She only has a pretty face

325
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,267
She hasn't been in the Harem for a long time. She already saw that bloody scene

326
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:02,440
How can she not be afraid?

327
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:08,036
But that An Daying... she seems weak, but even after seeing that, she still seems fine.

328
00:21:08,036 --> 00:21:10,892
You too have witnessed so many things that Hua Fei has done.

329
00:21:10,892 --> 00:21:12,564
The other day she came here to say greetings.

330
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,367
Although you are the biological mother of 3rd Prince.

331
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,567
You still need to greet here first

332
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:22,247
Empress, are you blaming me for being a coward?

333
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:26,612
But his majesty is not fond of 3rd Prince

334
00:21:26,612 --> 00:21:29,100
He also does not like me.

335
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,745
I am also old.

336
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:35,714
How can I compare with Hua Fei? She is young and beautiful. She also has the Nian family supporting her.

337
00:21:35,714 --> 00:21:37,933
You should consider the future

338
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:40,867
At least you have a Prince.

339
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:44,967
My 1st Prince and Empress of Purity's 2rd Prince died early.

340
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:47,367
3rd Prince is the eldest son.

341
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:52,400
Your standing is much more higher than Glory who hasn't given birth to any child.

342
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,333
But...

343
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,700
But, the Emperor doesn't like 3rd Prince.

344
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,700
If His majesty doesn't like him, you need to find a way to fix it.

345
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,233
You are such a cowardly mother

346
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:08,000
No wonder 3rd Prince is not making any progress

347
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,067
His majesty hasn't stepped into my palace

348
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:14,033
for months already

349
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:19,733
Niang niang, look.

350
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:22,200
Although Imperial Garden has chrysanthemums all over the place.

351
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,933
But they are not as charming as those in our Palace of Wings.

352
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:27,900
Of course. Different places have different aura that will nurture different characters.

353
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,600
The niang niang in our palace is the most beautiful

354
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,733
Of course flowers there is the most beautiful

355
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,333
Did you put honey on your mouth? Full of sweet lies.

356
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,233
How would I say such disrespectful words

357
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:38,833
I made niang niang unhappy again

358
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:41,800
But Niang Niang, what I said is true.

359
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:47,500
Niang niang. Look at those chrysanthemums

360
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,633
In my lifetime,

361
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,567
I haven't seen any green chrysanthemums

362
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:53,300
It's indeed very special

363
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,233
Look. The guys from the green house is in a hustle.

364
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:57,433
They are definitely for our palace.

365
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,367
Since they are for me.

366
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:01,933
Then stop them

367
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:04,133
Let's take a closer look.

368
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:06,233
You all come over.

369
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:14,167
Greetings, Princess of Glory 
- Rise

370
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:19,900
Greetings, Princess of Glory

371
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,700
Why did you walk so slowly?

372
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,967
Is this green chrysanthemum so precious that you are unable to lift your legs?

373
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:28,400
It is hard work for you to have bred such a precious flower

374
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,267
Put it here

375
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:33,567
Princess of Glory,

376
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:38,100
The Chrysanthemums...
- speak if you have something to say

377
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,733
Is for Hall of Chrysanthemums

378
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:47,500
Then bring them there.

379
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,233
Princess Glory, pleae forgive me! Princess Glory, please forgive me!

380
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:53,633
Niang niang, forgive me! Niang niang, forgive me!

381
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,100
Slap yourself

382
00:23:55,567 --> 00:24:02,867
It's all my fault! It's all my fault! It's all my fault!

383
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:05,767
Hall of Chrysanthemums

384
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:09,433
My lady, this sign is very pretty.

385
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:12,133
His majesty said he was going to change it, and changed it immediately.

386
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:14,467
He really has your ladyship on his mind.

387
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:17,500
Don't say things like this out loud.

388
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,600
People will laugh if they hear it.

389
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:34,800
Move quickly

390
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,100
It has taken so long to move a couple pots of flowers

391
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:41,267
From now on there will be no chrysanthemum in this palace

392
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:44,200
Quickly! Move them out!

393
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,567
It's still early to say greetings.

394
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:53,733
My lady, walk slowly

395
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:55,900
My bones are so stiff from sitting in the sedan chair

396
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,700
It's more comfortable to walk around like this

397
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:02,867
What's wrong with you? You dare to startle the lady!

398
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:04,067
I'm delivering water to House of Respectful Affairs.

399
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:05,600
I didn't mean to offend young mistress on purpose

400
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,567
All right, Cai Yue

401
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:08,500
Come home with me to change my clothes

402
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,233
Otherwise, we will be late.

403
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,267
Precious Shen is so early today

404
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:26,433
I am late for the greetings.

405
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:28,100
Please forgive me.

406
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,200
Greetings is about sincerity

407
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,400
Being late once in a while is not a big deal

408
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,067
Thank you, Niang Niang.

409
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,667
Give her a seat

410
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,867
Empress Niang Niang is as tolerative as always.

411
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,633
But I'm afraid your tolerance will spoil Precious Shen

412
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:45,533
and undermine the rules in the Harem

413
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:46,933
That's so right.

414
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:49,200
Don't take my words seriously,

415
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,167
But from now on, we can be absent from greetings to Empress

416
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:55,133
If we claim that we are sincere enough?

417
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:56,767
Replying to your words, Empress Niang Niang

418
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:58,600
We are not coming late on purpose

419
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,533
On our way here, an eunuch got our dresses dirty.

420
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:02,933
We have no choice but to go back to change.

421
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:04,833
Whether you are doing on purpose or not,

422
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:08,967
What you did is wrong. You should take responsibility for your own actions

423
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:17,467
Empress Niang Niang, although what Precious Shen did was wrong

424
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:19,533
But she is always cautious and dilegent in serving you.

425
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:22,367
Please forgive her this time

426
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:24,367
Pin of Respects is the main concubine of Palace of Whole Blessings

427
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:28,367
You are also responsible for Precious Shen's actions.

428
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:32,467
Let's not get other matters involved.

429
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:36,100
Meimei, what do you suggest I should do to her?

430
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,467
Shen Guiren has been arrogant and disrespected the Empress.

431
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,767
She should be flogged thirty times.

432
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:50,600
But I think we should be more flexible when executing the laws.

433
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,933
Since it's her first offence.

434
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:55,500
We should take 2-month stipend away as a token of penalty.

435
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,084
Pin of Respects is also responsible. Same penalty will be extended to her.

436
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:05,300
What do you think, Empress Niangniang

437
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,600
I admitted for being at fault.

438
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,167
But this has nothing to do with Pin of Respects.

439
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,633
Please reconsider.

440
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,500
Since Princess of Glory has made the decision for me.

441
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:20,767
I agreed. Only a little penalty is enough.

442
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:22,833
It's 2 months away from new year.

443
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,833
It is not convenient that they got stipends suspended.

444
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,400
1 month is enough.

445
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:30,100
Thank you, Empress Niangniang

446
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,833
I will keep this in mind. This will never happen again.

447
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:35,400
Rise.

448
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,700
Thank you, Empress Niangniang

449
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,367
You all must be tired. Go back to your palaces.

450
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:44,200
Excuse me.

451
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,933
Excuse me, then.

452
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:58,733
Actually we don't have to get into this matter so seriously

453
00:27:58,733 --> 00:28:01,167
Then what do you think?

454
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:03,467
I see you as my sister.

455
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:06,533
As you always dedicated in serving me.

456
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:09,600
So I never cared whether you come early or late

457
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:13,700
You think I am embarassing Precious Shen.

458
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:16,567
You are always generous

459
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:19,300
However the palace is different from the prince's mansion.

460
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,733
Because the Emperor knew that you were generous

461
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,467
He asked me to help manage the harem

462
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,200
This way my strict way and your gentle way could balance out

463
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,500
If I do not act this way

464
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,433
Then I would be unworthy of the trust that the Emperor placed on me

465
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,233
The Emperor asked Meimei to manage the harem.

466
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:37,500
Because he believed that Meimei would be the role model of the harem

467
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:37,758
Therefore in the future

468
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,467
when Meimei come to my palace to show respect

469
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,167
Please come earlier

470
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,933
I will remember that.

471
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,500
However there are times that the Emperor treasures me

472
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:51,133
and insists that I not wake up early.

473
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:53,267
So I ask Niang Niang

474
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:56,433
At that time, who should I listen to?

475
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,469
Both you and I are the Emperor's women

476
00:29:00,469 --> 00:29:02,267
Of course we will all listen to the Emeperor

477
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,633
Thanks for the Empress's clarification

478
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:08,667
Excuse me, then

479
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,500
I have something to tell Niang Niang

480
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,400
Speak

481
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:24,833
Fuzi was hit first and lose consciousness

482
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:26,433
then she was thrown into the well

483
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:27,400
For real?

484
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,800
There were scars for proof

485
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,433
There were severe damage to Fuzi's neck and head

486
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:33,300
Also on that day someone saw

487
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,500
the Emperor spoke to Fuzi in the Palace of Wings

488
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,967
The princess of glory became very upset right away

489
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,233
The princess of glory became more and more presumptuous

490
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:46,500
You tell the whole story truthfully to the Emperor

491
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,300
Yes

492
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:57,967
Bring me the general journals of House of Respectful Affairs.

493
00:29:57,967 --> 00:29:59,667
Zhou Gonggong has brought it here.

494
00:30:19,267 --> 00:30:21,333
This month, Precious Shen serves his majesty's night twice.

495
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,100
So did Precious Fucha.

496
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:26,400
Quite often

497
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,633
Not that often compared to you.

498
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:32,867
But his majesty only visited the Harem seven times

499
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:35,100
We should plan ahead.

500
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,467
Otherwise when they got arrogant in the future,

501
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:41,567
I can't control them anymore.

502
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,000
His majesty values the harmony between Han and Man.

503
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:49,967
Ask Precious Fucha to come here.

504
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:52,033
I will give her a good lesson.

505
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,767
Yes.

506
00:31:00,037 --> 00:31:03,921
Precious Fucha.

507
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:14,033
His majesty often says, Man and Han are families.

508
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:17,500
You should know Han Chinese when serving his majesty

509
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,833
When he is writing something

510
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:22,100
You should be grinding the ink.

511
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,633
It's hard to grind ink.

512
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,267
You've got to spend more time practising.

513
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:30,168
Yes.

514
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,367
What I have told you can benefit you.

515
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:39,200
You think grinding for 2 hours is enough?

516
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:41,833
You still need more practice

517
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,878
Robzandanzing Tribe in Qinghai has risen in rebellation

518
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,533
Northwestern China is politically unstable.

519
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:58,033
Zhang Tingyu!

520
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,100
Who do you recommend that can be sent to pacify the rebels.

521
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,067
I think, when talking about military talent and trustworthiness,

522
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:08,900
Only one man is suitable

523
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,137
Nian Geng Yao

524
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:11,767
How insightful you are.

525
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:13,600
It's less than a year since youre enthroned

526
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,714
8th and 9th Prince's gang has not been eradicated.

527
00:32:16,714 --> 00:32:19,533
Nian Gengyao is the elder brother of Princess of Glory.

528
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:21,433
He is in charge of Northwestern military affairs for many years.

529
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:23,300
That's why I think,

530
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,400
Nian Gengyao is the best choice.

531
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,302
Nian Gengyao indeed contributed a lot to my enthronement.

532
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:35,033
But now he seems to have autocracy in Northwestern China.

533
00:32:35,033 --> 00:32:38,633
Yue Zhongqi, Left military governer, is the 21st descendant of Yue Fei (A famous general in history)

534
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:40,300
He is also familiar with Northwestern affairs.

535
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,600
People call him A General that never Loses.

536
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,467
He is cautious and smart. Why don't we...?

537
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:50,133
Then I will appoint Nian Gengyao

538
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:52,333
to General of Expedition.

539
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:56,100
Yue Zhongqi to General of Courage and Efforts. Also he will act as consultant for Nian Gengyao

540
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,533
Send them to Qinghai to pacify the rebels.

541
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:00,267
We will follow your orders.

542
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,333
Zhou Ninghai from Palace of Wings brought some dim sums to you.

543
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,767
They are from Princess of Glory.

544
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:16,367
They invite you to taste some.

545
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:17,900
Let him leave the dim sums here.

546
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,800
Yes.

547
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:25,170
I remembered that General of Jilin pay tributes to me and send me a pot of East Pearl.

548
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:31,200
Take it to Princess of Glory in person.

549
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,567
Tell her that it is a reward for her assistance in managing the Harem

550
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:37,733
Yes

551
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:44,800
It's late. Please go to bed.

552
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,267
I'm not sleepy at all

553
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:50,400
It's rare that you are so energetic

554
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,833
not sleepy at all

555
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,167
Ever since you fell ill,

556
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:55,633
except for Precious Shen, Promise An and Lingering Chun,

557
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,000
Nobody came here to visit you.

558
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,600
These few days,

559
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,400
I know that the servants and eunuchs are lazy.

560
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,033
I only asked them to do something trival,

561
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:10,299
even Little Yinzi dare to bicker with me.

562
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,200
It's understandable

563
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,099
We can't force them to do things they don't want to do.

564
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:16,099
Yes

565
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,200
Listen. Somebody is crying.

566
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,367
It's little Yunzi.

567
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:32,267
It's his night shift.

568
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:34,200
Let's go to see him

569
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,100
Why are you crying so sadly?

570
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:48,367
Sorry to bother you. Please forgive me.

571
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,199
Everyone has unhappy moments.

572
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,967
It's not a crime to be sad.

573
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:56,700
But tell me the reason

574
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,300
My elder brother is working for Imperial Warehouse.

575
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,033
He has been sick for over a month and does not get any better.

576
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,633
That's why I'm sad.

577
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:06,033
Everyone of us can be sick from time to time

578
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:09,200
Since I don't have anything to do these days.

579
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,633
You can go to attend your brother.

580
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,433
Thank you, young mistress.

581
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,167
Young mistress, it's getting cold.

582
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:17,800
Let's go back inside.

583
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,067
It's late. You can go to your room

584
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:21,133
Yes

585
00:35:26,433 --> 00:35:28,700
Your majesty is tired because of the state affairs.

586
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,833
I asked them to make cubilose with lotus seeds.

587
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:32,100
It's nourishing and clearing.

588
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,600
Please have some

589
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:46,600
Thank you for this.

590
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,833
Fuzi's death has been reported to you by Jiang Fuhai.

591
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:55,767
Ladies in the Harem always get jealousy over little things.

592
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:59,033
I don't have a solution to it. Please tell me what to do.

593
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,733
I know who you are talking about.

594
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,800
Ladies get jealousy all the time.

595
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:07,833
But if they don't love me,

596
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,300
there won't be any problem

597
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,367
I don't want to blame them for loving me.

598
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,733
You should have more patience.

599
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:16,833
Yes

600
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,467
cubilose can moisterize the lungs.

601
00:36:21,867 --> 00:36:27,233
It's winter. You should eat something more nourishing.

602
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:28,833
Thank your for your concern

603
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,933
How is Lingering Smile doing?

604
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:41,233
Docter Wen is known for his brilliant medical skills.

605
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:45,067
It's just Lingering Smile is still not getting any better.

606
00:36:45,067 --> 00:36:46,833
But it takes time to recover from any diseases.

607
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,133
According to the doctor,

608
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:49,867
Lingering Smile doesn't have enough Chi. She is very week.

609
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:51,533
It takes time to build up her health.

610
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:56,267
Then tell her to be patient. Take good rest and nourishment.

611
00:36:56,267 --> 00:36:57,333
Yes

612
00:36:57,967 --> 00:37:00,315
Look at you.

613
00:37:00,315 --> 00:37:02,137
Who do you want to impress with that upset face.

614
00:37:03,323 --> 00:37:06,533
Shifu, look at Lingering Smile. (Shifu = teacher)

615
00:37:06,533 --> 00:37:08,110
As a servant

616
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,433
Why servants of other Consorts can be so proud.

617
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:11,896
we are such a loss of face.

618
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:14,351
You think I am proud of myself?

619
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,700
Little Youzi from Precious Fucha,

620
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:22,762
Only because his majesty likes his mistress. He dare to call me his brother.

621
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:24,433
He should look into the mirror,

622
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:27,233
Who the hell does he thinks he is.

623
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:32,180
It's young mistress's fault.

624
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,467
It's been two months. She is still not getting any better.

625
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:37,706
I heard Doctor Wen said,

626
00:37:37,706 --> 00:37:39,767
Maybe she still needs more time to recover.

627
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:41,339
Maybe it's pulmonary tuberculosis

628
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:42,333
Don't say that.

629
00:37:43,354 --> 00:37:45,300
I think Young mistress,

630
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,512
can't have adoration even though she recoverd. Since the illness has destroyed her face

631
00:37:48,512 --> 00:37:51,178
We became the servants of the servants all because of her.

632
00:37:51,178 --> 00:37:53,733
Palace of Shattered Jade is such an unlucky palace.

633
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:57,304
It used to have Fang Guiren.

634
00:37:57,304 --> 00:37:59,815
Now it's the unhealthy Wan Changzai.

635
00:38:00,937 --> 00:38:04,034
No. We can't go under with her.

636
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:07,994
Please tell me what to do, Shifu,

637
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,875
Be smart.

638
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:13,754
Shifu, it's your shift today.

639
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:16,901
She is sick so she doesn't get around.

640
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:19,467
nothing can happen even if I am not on duty

641
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:21,433
But we should plan ahead.

642
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,609
about transfering to other young mistress's place.

643
00:38:31,118 --> 00:38:32,532
Young mistress wants a cup of hot tea.

644
00:38:32,532 --> 00:38:34,140
What takes you so long.

645
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,365
If she wants a cup of tea.

646
00:38:35,365 --> 00:38:37,834
I need to start a fire and boil the water.

647
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:39,127
Tell her to wait a little longer.

648
00:38:39,127 --> 00:38:41,549
One more thing, this month Internal Affairs Authority

649
00:38:41,549 --> 00:38:44,171
hasn't delivered young mistress's regular tea.

650
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:46,186
She can only drink water then

651
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:49,079
Yesterday I saw you were drinking tea.

652
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,067
Why young mistress can't drink any tea?

653
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:53,319
Did you drink all the tea?

654
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:54,405
We are in the Harem

655
00:38:54,405 --> 00:38:56,570
It takes proof and evidence to accuse me of anything

656
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,267
You think you are still in your maiden home?

657
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:01,262
Peier,

658
00:39:02,481 --> 00:39:04,931
Liuzhu is the close servant of young mistress.

659
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:07,732
You have been in the forbidden city for a long time. Why you still don't behave like you are supposed to.

660
00:39:07,732 --> 00:39:09,611
Boil the water as soon as possible.

661
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:11,804
If we ran out of tea, go pick some up in Internal Affairs Authority.

662
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:23,250
Lingering won't get any better.

663
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,304
Since Pin of Beauty likes you.

664
00:39:25,304 --> 00:39:26,897
Please take me with you.

665
00:39:30,505 --> 00:39:31,999
Gonggong has found a better place to go.

666
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:33,770
Why don't you just tell young mistress?

667
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,039
We can celebrate.

668
00:39:37,386 --> 00:39:38,918
Sooner or later.

669
00:39:40,243 --> 00:39:41,890
Come on. Let's go to see her.

670
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:50,535
Young mistress,

671
00:39:53,107 --> 00:39:54,436
I'm telling you, young mistress

672
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:57,564
We can't serve you any longer.

673
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:01,054
What happened? Tell me about it.

674
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:07,264
