4
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:07,533
I report to you, Young Mistress...

5
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:10,100
We may no longer serve you!

6
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:13,233
What happened? Tell me about it.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,433
Eunuchs from Internal Affairs Authority has told me,

8
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:22,333
Pin of Beauty from Palace of A Blissful Beginning,

9
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,633
asked me to serve her.

10
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,367
I see.

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,167
It's a good place to go

12
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,667
It's a fortunate thing for you.

13
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,667
Pack your stuff and go.

14
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,000
Thank you, young mistress.

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,600
I don't want to leave you,

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,367
Please take care

17
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,900
Huanbi,

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,133
Get everyone here.

19
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:04,933
Yes.

20
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:14,800

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,300
It's been 2 months since I fell ill.

22
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:29,100
I don't like noises.

23
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:32,033
I don't need too many servants.

24
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:36,167
So I want to ask you all something.

25
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:38,033
If anyone wants to leave Palace of Shattered Jade.

26
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:41,100
Huanbi will give you some mony and you may leave.

27
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:46,933
Everyone, let's congratulate Kang Gonggong and YIn Gonggong.

28
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:49,533
Pin of Beauty has asked them to serve.

29
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:51,500
They will leave as soon as they finish packing.

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,367
Young mistress always treats you well.

31
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:55,667
Kang gonggong is flattery like a dog.

32
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,602
But now you find a better spot you just leave without saying anything

33
00:01:57,602 --> 00:01:59,967
You don't even care about loyalty.

34
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:01,898
Liuzhu, you are wrong about me.

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,300
I want to serve young mistress with my whole heart.

36
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,400
But Pin of Beauty specifically asked for me.

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,666
I had no choice.

38
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,133
"No Choice"?

39
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,600
I don't know why anyone will force you to serve her.

40
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,467
Since you want to serve young mistress with your whole heart.

41
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:20,867
Then we must make your wish come true.

42
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:22,867
Why don't you go refuse Pin of Beauty's offer?

43
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:24,133
Tell her,

44
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,067
You are too loyal to serve another mistress

45
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:27,900
Pin of Beauty won't blame you.

46
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,767
And I will apologize to you.

47
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:33,200
But I'm afraid someone is just bluffing.

48
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,333
Liuzhu

49
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:36,467
Kang Gonggong is such a loyal servant.

50
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:37,767
that he will do the same thing to every mistress.

51
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:40,200
Huanbi, give him money.

52
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,900
Kang gonggong. Have a nice trip

53
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,133
Yin Gonggong. Hold tight.

54
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:55,500
Learn that loyalty from your shifu.

55
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,100
You will have a bright future

56
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:02,300
Thank you. Young mistress.

57
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,767
Anyone who wants to leave may leave.

58
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,800
Now we still have leaving allowances for you.

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,667
If you want to leave after today?

60
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,100
Young mistress will report it to the Empress.

61
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,600
You will be dragged to Bureau of Cautious Punishment to serve as a hard laborer

62
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,533
Think twice!

63
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:24,167
I'm too stupid to serve you.

64
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:39,867
I am willing to follow young mistress. I will never betray you.

65
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:46,400
I wll also follow you.

66
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,167
I received such a big favor from Lingering.

67
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,067
I will never betray you.

68
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:56,300
Why do you say this?

69
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,833
My brother in Imperial Warehouse is so sick. Nobody cares about him

70
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,283
You still care about him even if you are sick.

71
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:03,048
You also asked Doctor Wen to treat him

72
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:04,002
Otherwise,

73
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,500
Otherwise, my brother will be dead already.

74
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,333
You have been so great to us.

75
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,033
I will be loyal to you till the end of my life.

76
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,333
Even when I am dead,

77
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,533
after my reincarnation as a cow.

78
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:16,533
I will carry you to be a Buddha.

79
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:18,033
Idiot.

80
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,799
That's exactly what's on my mind.

81
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:21,066
I will never lie.

82
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:22,700
All right now.

83
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:25,300
Stop Kow towing. You will abrase your head.

84
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,833
Then I have to get Doctor Wen here for you one more time.

85
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Other people are saying

86
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,033
Everyone in Palace of Shattered Jade

87
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:32,533
is sick and unhealthy

88
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,933
Now it's winter. Cold at night

89
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:40,600
Little Yunzi will be affected by the weather while on duty

90
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,867
Prepare a thicker blanket for him

91
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,033
Yes

92
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,333
Thank you, Young mistress

93
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,433
Since you are following me

94
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:55,133
who is sick all day and doesn't receive any adoration.

95
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:57,100
You never have any good things coming.

96
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,467
But you still treat me like this.

97
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,233
I have nothing to return the favor.

98
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:05,267
As long as I live for another day

99
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:09,000
I won't let you feel wronged.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,600
Thank you, young mistress.

101
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,933
Internal Affairs Authority is so lazy.

102
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:20,467
They think that our young mistress is not powerful enough.

103
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:21,833
They won't even deliver any decent charcoals to us.

104
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,433
Quiet. Look.

105
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:25,933
Young mistress is still sick

106
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:28,733
She will feel bad if she hears about this.

107
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,300
Is the water ready?

108
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,300
Yes

109
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,333
We can't use this charcoal. Too smokey.

110
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:37,900
Let me get a hand warmer ready (using hot water)

111
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,300
Put it onto young mistress's bed. That will make her feel warmer

112
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,033
Go ahead

113
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,300
Greetings, young mistresses

114
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,867
It's getting cold. Does your mistress sleep well?

115
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,633
Greetings, Precious Shen, Promise An.

116
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,100
This room is so cold

117
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,300
How is it? Are you feeling better?

118
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,500
Sister

119
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,067
Your hands are so cold

120
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,100
Are you feeling better?

121
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:12,267
It's still the same

122
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:14,400
You can't stay like this forever

123
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:19,267
Your jade ornament has such a good color

124
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:20,800
It must be a gift from the Emperor right?

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,733
Mei Jiejie is in the Emperor's favor right now

126
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:28,333
Palace of Shattered Jade is cold and remote. It's not suitable for a patient to live here.

127
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,967
I brought you some silver charcoal. Just use them for the moment.

128
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:35,100
I saw Jinxi was using black charcoal.

129
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,200
It must be those sneaky servants from Internal Affairs Authority who won't give you supplies.

130
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,300
I should report it to the Empress

131
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:44,567
I've been sick for a long time 
It's no wonder that they don't treat me as well

132
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:46,000
It's better to have one less problem than one more

133
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:48,567
Not to mention since you're in favor right now

134
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,267
They don't dare to treat me too badly

135
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:54,200
Not to mention, you guys have brought it to me anyways

136
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,133
Bring me something when I need it desperately. Nothing can compare to this favor.

137
00:06:57,933 --> 00:06:59,600
It's all because you have a good personality

138
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,633
You can even tolerate Kang Fuhai's leave. He is such an ungrateful thing

139
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,600
Since he is ungrateful,

140
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,100
It's better not to keep him around

141
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:10,192
What you mean is?

142
00:07:10,192 --> 00:07:13,133
It doesn't matter if you have a lot of servants 
What you need are loyal ones

143
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:18,033
That's right. I should pay attention to that when I go back

144
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:20,067
You too LinRong

145
00:07:21,088 --> 00:07:23,345
I don't know how to educate my servants

146
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:24,733
Thanks for your reminder

147
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:29,343
Your illness hasn't improved in a long time

148
00:07:29,343 --> 00:07:32,973
It's because you're worrying too much right?

149
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:35,359
I'm ok. How about you?

150
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:38,854
Have you served the Emperor?

151
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:41,244
Why would the Emperor remember me?

152
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:42,464
Don't think too much about it

153
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:44,136
The wars in northwestern regions are pressing

154
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:46,705
It's natural that the Emperor doesn't come to the Inner Palace

155
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:48,980
Sooner or later you will serve the Emperor

156
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:51,906
I know the Emperor is busy

157
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:55,064
I've heard that it's been over 10 days since he visited the Harem

158
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:58,540
Yes, if the Empress Dowager finds out she'll nag about it

159
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:04,700
I know the weather is cold, need to hold a warmer

160
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,379
With this cover, you won't burn your hands

161
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:09,330
So I made this for you overnight

162
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:14,663
Flower Woven Silk. when we all came into the palace

163
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:16,303
we all received a piece of this

164
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:18,337
Such good cloth

165
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:20,513
made into a warmer cover, isn't it a waste?

166
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:25,057
It's not a waste. I don't have anything good enough for you

167
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:26,450
As long as you like it

168
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,742
I like it

169
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,149
It's almost the end of the year

170
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:31,535
The Empress wants me to visit the palaces

171
00:08:31,535 --> 00:08:34,222
and see how the decorations are going. I have to go now

172
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,172
Go ahead, be careful on the road

173
00:08:37,147 --> 00:08:39,959
Then I will also come visit you another day

174
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:42,060
Your body is weak, it's cold outside

175
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,337
so don't walk around outside, or else you'll catch a cold

176
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:47,216
It's ok, I like being with you both

177
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:51,124
Jin Xi, escort them out

178
00:08:51,124 --> 00:08:52,039
Yes

179
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,803
Take care of yourself

180
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:01,844
It's time for your medicine

181
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,752
How long do you have to keep drinking this medicine?

182
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:15,046
Medicine is still part poision, I'm afraid it'll harm your body

183
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:18,500
This medicine just doesn't let me recover as fast

184
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,508
It's fine

185
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:23,100
No one's found out right?

186
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,622
It's only me and Liu Zhu, no one else knows

187
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:28,733
However

188
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:31,100
Why do you also hide it from Precious Shen and Promise An?

189
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,917
Because we are like sisters,

190
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:36,610
I can't tell them

191
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,337
There's always a possibility

192
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:40,048
that someone finds out

193
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:41,613
I won't drag them down with me

194
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:49,400
Look

195
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,651
It's rare for Cai Yue to come here

196
00:09:51,651 --> 00:09:53,191
Please sit

197
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:54,105
Bring a chair, invite her to sit

198
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:55,892
I'm not sitting

199
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:58,160
I just helped Precious send some things to Palace of Shattered Jade

200
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,743
So I came to get this month's allowance

201
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:03,679
Go wrap up Precious Shen's monthly salary

202
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,212
and give it to Miss CaiYue

203
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:05,940
Yes

204
00:10:07,225 --> 00:10:09,289
You were at the Palace of Shattered Jade?

205
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:10,265
That's right

206
00:10:10,265 --> 00:10:13,555
My young mistress is friends with Lingering Smile

207
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:14,848
Lingering Smile is sick

208
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,566
My young mistress thinks about her often

209
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:19,785
Lingering Smile should get some treatment

210
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,078
Of course

211
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,700
Since she's sick, she needs some extra care

212
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,768
Palace of Shattered Jade is always out of stuff

213
00:10:25,768 --> 00:10:28,594
Thankfully my young mistress picks out good things to send there

214
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,620
Or else who knows what it would be like for them

215
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,539
This isn't something Precious should worry about

216
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:36,675
This is our Internal Affair Authority's lack of attention

217
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:38,897
I will definitely get someone to replenish them

218
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:42,078
You're in charge of everything in the Interal Affairs Authority

219
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:44,043
There are a million things for you to do every day

220
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,350
It must be your servants who forgot about it

221
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:53,445
SongZhi Gu Gu, what brings your honor here?

222
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,740
Don't flatter me

223
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,458
It's almost the new year

224
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,209
Palace of Wing's gold paper is running out

225
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:00,977
I'm afraid Niang Niang will use it to wrap gifts

226
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:02,442
so I came over to pick up some

227
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:04,214
Why didn't you say so earlier

228
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:07,418
Palace of Wing's gold paper was sent over first thing

229
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:09,376
We also doubled the amount

230
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:12,959
Just now the Empress's palace just took a stack

231
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,909
What's remaining we still have to give out to each palace's young mistresses

232
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,335
I'm afraid We don't have any extra

233
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:21,255
Huang Gui Quan

234
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:25,403
I'm afraid you don't want your job any more

235
00:11:25,403 --> 00:11:28,302
It's always been that you'll give whatever the Palace of Wing's wants

236
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:30,731
Since inventories are low, just bring them all to me

237
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,449
and purchase some for others later right?

238
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:33,510
This...

239
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:38,402
Some people's young mistress's have low standing

240
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:41,142
They're not good enough to have gold paper to wrap gifts

241
00:11:41,142 --> 00:11:43,096
Wouldn't you say so?

242
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:44,168
Here

243
00:11:44,168 --> 00:11:45,336
Thanks

244
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,862
You've come to get this month's allowance?

245
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:51,104
Congratulations

246
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,072
I'm afraid I remember the wrong date

247
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:56,041
I thought Precious Shen was still under punishment

248
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,373
and not able to get her monthly salary

249
00:12:06,577 --> 00:12:09,860
Huang Gui Quan, let me tell you

250
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,168
When the time comes and you don't have any

251
00:12:12,168 --> 00:12:13,564
don't blame Niang Niang for getting mad at you

252
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,924
What the heck...

253
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:41,064
It's so cold out

254
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:42,371
Has the annual bonus come out?

255
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:43,832
Yes

256
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:46,528
For Precious Shen's sake, Internal Affairs Authority

257
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:47,582
gave us all of it

258
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,945
Thankfully we have Precious Shen

259
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:53,155
Just now Precious Shen sent someone over

260
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:54,601
and gave us a bunch of stuff

261
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:55,530
Really?

262
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,334
Now we can have a good new years celebration

263
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:00,369
Today is the 25th right?

264
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,248
Don't know if young mistress's illness can get better

265
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:06,606
Don't want her to miss out on the new years eve feast

266
00:13:06,606 --> 00:13:10,582
Just now Jiang Fu Ha came with an edict

267
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,950
Saying that since young mistress is sick

268
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,244
Empress is allowing her to stay here and rest

269
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:17,782
She doesn't need to attend the new years eve feast

270
00:13:17,782 --> 00:13:18,843
That's great

271
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:20,290
We'll be waiting for the new year to come

272
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,687
And have a good new years celebration with young mistress

273
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:23,898
That's right

274
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:33,934
The Emperor and Empress have arrived

275
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:43,486
Greetings Emperor and Empress

276
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:46,019
Today is a family feast, don't be so formal

277
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:46,909
Sit

278
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,759
Thank you your Majesty

279
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,892
imperial brother always says we don't have to be formal

280
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:54,911
But acoording to rules, we still have to be 
(Duke of Fruits, Yunli)

281
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:57,504
Only 17th brother would say this

282
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,844
He's most afraid of being formal

283
00:13:59,844 --> 00:14:02,713
Today he hasn't escaped and was not late

284
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:04,556
It's already a very rare thing

285
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:09,246
Everyone is here today, how can I be late?

286
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:12,347
First give a toast to Imperial brother

287
00:14:12,347 --> 00:14:16,591
Wishing you longevity, pease and health 
May our country have peace and prosperity

288
00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:17,559
Good

289
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:21,042
Wishing your majesty a hundred years' peace, health and fortune.

290
00:14:23,675 --> 00:14:28,358
May the Emperor live forever

291
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:29,494
Drink

292
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:39,491
This wine is great

293
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:40,547
Princess of Glory

294
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:44,619
Did you also drink it all?

295
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:45,827
Of course

296
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:55,066
Your Majesty seems very happy today

297
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,418
This afternoon there was news from the Northwest

298
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:05,079
Nian GengYao put down Robzang Danjin's rebellion

299
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:08,162
Capture their generals and officials

300
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,413
What a good Nian Gengyao

301
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:14,371
What a good General Nian

302
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,206
Congratulations Your Majesty

303
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:21,882
Congratulations Your Majesty, all is well now

304
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:24,333
Your brother, very good

305
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:28,728
Brother is working hard in the frontier

306
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,790
I am working hard here in the Harem

307
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,272
That's what we should do

308
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:49,889
Everything's good in our yard

309
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:52,568
except for a few winter plums and pine trees

310
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:53,915
With this snow

311
00:15:53,915 --> 00:15:55,661
the yard's all empty

312
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:57,591
If you feel it's empty

313
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:59,070
We can cut some window flowers

314
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,763
It will seem even more lively

315
00:16:00,763 --> 00:16:01,624
Sounds good

316
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:03,621
Then please get me some colored paper and gold or silver papers.

317
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:04,914
Let's cut window flowers

318
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:05,650
Good good.

319
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,311
I'll go get the papers

320
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:08,613
Then I'll go get some scissors

321
00:16:08,613 --> 00:16:10,649
Then I'll find some patterns

322
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:11,970
I'll go with you

323
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:05,171
Niangniang, Princess of Modesty's palace has sent someone here.

324
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:07,145
saying that Princess of Modesty's old illness striked again.

325
00:17:07,145 --> 00:17:08,832
They want a doctor.

326
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:14,102
Today's new year eve. She is bringing bad luck

327
00:17:14,102 --> 00:17:15,236
Don't send any doctors

328
00:17:15,236 --> 00:17:18,378
What if Princess of Modesty send someone for a doctor on her own?

329
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:19,631
Pass my words to the imperial hospital

330
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:23,217
Whoever dares to treat that bitch

331
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:25,474
acts against the will of Nian Shilan.

332
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:28,202
I see. Excuse me

333
00:17:43,749 --> 00:17:45,776
Your majesty, let me toast you

334
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:51,507
Where is Lingering Smile?

335
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:54,876
Lingering Smile is still recovering.

336
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:57,982
It's so cold outside. So I told her to have a rest.

337
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:20,081
Jinxi, let me see.

338
00:18:23,907 --> 00:18:26,208
Look at the peacock spreading its tails. Jinxi made it looks like a real one.

339
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,114
So nice

340
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:27,613
Yes

341
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:29,700
But the portrait of Two Gods of Love made by young mistress is better.

342
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:33,095
Look. They almost come to life.

343
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,123
Two Gods of Love don't actually exist.

344
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:37,365
I was just thinking of a pattern

345
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:39,542
But I heard there are people,

346
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,267
Their paper cut works look exactly the same as a real person

347
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:43,317
But I haven't seen such talented people.

348
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:47,478
Young mistress, we have someone who can do this

349
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:50,174
I saw Little Yunzi cut your portrait.

350
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:51,709
And he hides it in his sleeves

351
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:52,795
- Really? 
- Don't talk nonsense.

352
00:18:52,795 --> 00:18:54,438
Little Yunzi. Don't be over modest.

353
00:18:54,438 --> 00:18:55,050
Let me see

354
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,805
Take it out.

355
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:05,881
So vivid.

356
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:08,177
Little Yunzi, you got a talent.

357
00:19:08,177 --> 00:19:08,928
Exactly

358
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:09,929
I'm not that good.

359
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:11,341
I can't cut out something as beautiful as you are.

360
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:13,684
Next time let me cut something better for you

361
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:15,143
It does look like young mistress.

362
00:19:15,143 --> 00:19:17,380
But if we only look at those eyes and eyebrows

363
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,287
It also looks like Huanbi

364
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:23,267
How can I be compared to Young mistress

365
00:19:23,267 --> 00:19:24,325
Let me see

366
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:27,657
Huanbi has served me so long

367
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:29,014
that we actually look alike

368
00:19:30,026 --> 00:19:32,146
Why wouldn't I look like you?

369
00:19:32,146 --> 00:19:33,521
If all of us looks the same,

370
00:19:33,521 --> 00:19:34,669
That's scary

371
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:39,034
But you are as naughty as I am

372
00:19:40,068 --> 00:19:42,901
I heard people in the forbidden city say that,

373
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:43,990
In new year's eve

374
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,633
If you hang something precious to you onto the branches.

375
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:48,024
as high as you can,

376
00:19:48,024 --> 00:19:49,267
Then you can make a wish.

377
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:51,353
If young mistress likes this portrait.

378
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:53,675
why don't we hang it onto the tree in our yard?

379
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:56,694
Then we can pray that everything will go well in the new year.

380
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:58,853
This is also a blessing to Little Yunzi

381
00:19:58,853 --> 00:20:00,014
Good idea.

382
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:04,426
But in our yard there are nothing but withered trees

383
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:06,100
There's no point hanging the portrait there.

384
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:08,733
Why don't we find somewhere with winter plums

385
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:10,767
And hang the portrait there 
-Good

386
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:13,400
Garden of Winter Plums is a great choice. It's also close.

387
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,333
Are there white ones?

388
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,618
Jade green stamens and wingceltis colored center.

389
00:20:15,618 --> 00:20:18,633
the blossoms are like red clouds. So beautiful

390
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:20,300
Not bad

391
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,467
Red plums with white snow

392
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:25,433
Subtle scents are floating around

393
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,133
That's what we call a great scene

394
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:28,800
Let me check it out

395
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,933
Young mistress!

396
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:32,367
You haven't fully recovered.

397
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:33,400
It's not good to walk around

398
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,333
And Empress has explicit orders that since you are still ill, it's better to avoid walking out.

399
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,733
If Empress heard about this, she will blame us. 
- right

400
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,203
It's already late night.

401
00:20:43,203 --> 00:20:46,338
Everyone is in the family feast

402
00:20:46,338 --> 00:20:48,133
I will wear my cape.

403
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:50,233
It's warm and inconspicuous

404
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:52,233
I've been sick for such a long time

405
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,000
It's time to go out and get some distractions

406
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,533
Young mistress! 
-Nobody is allowed to follow me

407
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:57,633
I will go by myself

408
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,267
If anyone dares to stop me

409
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:06,400
I will let him kneeled in the snow for the whole night.

410
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:35,467
5th Brother. Let me toast you.

411
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:39,633
Wish you peace. 
- Wish you all go well

412
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,700
Have the winter plums flowered yet?

413
00:22:06,686 --> 00:22:08,249
Beautiful blossoms despite the snow.

414
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:10,731
I want to see.

415
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:12,404
It's cold ouside.

416
00:22:12,404 --> 00:22:14,133
Please watch out for your health

417
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:16,265
Beautiful blossoms despite the snow

418
00:22:16,265 --> 00:22:17,016
I can't let them down

419
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:18,743
Don't say anything

420
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,929
Su Peisheng

421
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:23,314
Your majesty?

422
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:26,185
Don't let anyone follow me

423
00:22:26,185 --> 00:22:27,098
I want to be alone for a while

424
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:29,362
To sober up

425
00:22:32,198 --> 00:22:33,601
But your majesty,

426
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,299
Don't say anything 
- Your majesty...

427
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:38,134
Your majesty, are you going anywhere?

428
00:22:48,078 --> 00:22:50,281
Empress Niangniang, what should we do now

429
00:22:50,795 --> 00:22:52,181
It's dark and slippery outside

430
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:58,785
17th brother,

431
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,703
His majesty won't allow anyone to follow him

432
00:23:03,703 --> 00:23:05,000
But it's dark and slippery ouside

433
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,314
We have to send someone to accompany him

434
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,237
Why putting red plums out.

435
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,324
Princess of Glory isn't aware of it.

436
00:23:14,362 --> 00:23:16,368
The decorations are Glory's responsibility

437
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:19,673
Rest assured, I'll check him out

438
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:40,463
What the heck I'm sent to do!

439
00:23:41,093 --> 00:23:41,828
It's New year's eve 
(Yu. (Family name Yu))

440
00:23:41,828 --> 00:23:43,420
Only I am sent here in such cold weather

441
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:45,453
cutting flowers for worshipping the heaven later

442
00:23:45,453 --> 00:23:47,159
They are just bullying me because I'm new here.

443
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,642
When entered the Harem

444
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,958
girls will pray for his majesty's adoration

445
00:25:12,408 --> 00:25:15,607
I only wish that my parents and my younger sister can be heathy and safely

446
00:25:16,605 --> 00:25:19,590
that I can survive the Harem

447
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:21,067
stay safe untill I'm dead

448
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,608
In the Harem there are only endless schemes

449
00:25:25,633 --> 00:25:27,273
It's hard to keep myself safe

450
00:25:29,837 --> 00:25:32,970
I wish. If the wind can understand my heart, 
(comparing herself to the winter plums)

451
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:33,936
then it shall not break me. 
(comparing herself to the winter plums)

452
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,423
Who is that over there

453
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,554
Who is that?

454
00:25:46,854 --> 00:25:47,656
If you don't show yourself

455
00:25:47,656 --> 00:25:49,327
I will ask servants to search the whole Garden of Winter Plums.

456
00:25:53,603 --> 00:25:55,561
I'm a maid from Garden of WInter Plum

457
00:25:56,902 --> 00:25:58,575
I don't want to disturb your highness. Please forgive me

458
00:25:59,618 --> 00:26:01,308
You received education?

459
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:01,983
What's your name?

460
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,185
I'm too humble. Don't let my name distain your ears.

461
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:11,372
Don't get any closer

462
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:15,667
My socks and shoes are wet. I'm changing

463
00:27:04,085 --> 00:27:06,160
This year the blossoms are as good as in the past.

464
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:11,291
Every year, the flowers are always alike.

465
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:14,269
But every year, people change.

466
00:27:16,973 --> 00:27:18,341
Pincess of Glory has cut many plums and put them in vases

467
00:27:18,842 --> 00:27:19,851
She didn't do that on purpose

468
00:27:21,576 --> 00:27:22,507
It's my fault

469
00:27:23,955 --> 00:27:27,082
Princess of Glory married me for a short time. she didn't know anything

470
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,231
All these year, you still can't let go?

471
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:34,279
What are you talking about?

472
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,249
I'm waiting for spring when it gets warm

473
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,270
Then you can come to visit me. Let's chat and play chess

474
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:49,047
That's exactly what I intend to do

475
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,979
But now I can smell the intoxicating scents of Plums

476
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:54,494
I want to drink.

477
00:27:54,976 --> 00:27:57,850
Such a nice plan. Let me join you

478
00:27:59,103 --> 00:28:01,036
Looking for plums in the snow. Let's have the best of the moment

479
00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:02,672
We should drink

480
00:28:02,841 --> 00:28:03,933
Another wonderful thing

481
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,923
I didn't expect a maid can have such learning.

482
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:10,703
It's a nice suprise

483
00:28:10,703 --> 00:28:11,837
Congratulations

484
00:28:16,983 --> 00:28:17,986
You are back, young mistress

485
00:28:19,138 --> 00:28:19,998
You are back!

486
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,769
What's up?

487
00:28:26,848 --> 00:28:28,141
Here. Have a cup of tea

488
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,913
Are you frozen with cold?

489
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:36,397
What's going on?

490
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:43,631
Two cats were runing at me

491
00:28:44,644 --> 00:28:45,467
It scares me

492
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:47,439
Young mistress is afraid of cats since she is a kid

493
00:28:47,862 --> 00:28:49,478
Two cats at once. She must be scared

494
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,945
Let me make some ginger soup

495
00:28:51,945 --> 00:28:53,483
It will help you stay warm and calm

496
00:28:57,012 --> 00:28:58,029
Young mistress,

497
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:59,806
people in the forbidden city love to keep cats as pets

498
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:01,559
Cats are wild animals

499
00:29:01,924 --> 00:29:02,970
If you are afraid of cats

500
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,121
be careful

501
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:07,025
Young mistress, do you make a wish?

502
00:29:09,412 --> 00:29:09,959
Yes

503
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:12,479
It's too cold. So I came back

504
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:18,625
How do you find me

505
00:29:19,074 --> 00:29:19,942
Please forgive me

506
00:29:21,838 --> 00:29:23,907
I'm worried. Even if you are going to pass death penalty on me, I'm still concerned

507
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,727
Nobody's serving you

508
00:29:26,392 --> 00:29:28,435
So I followed Duke of Fruits here.

509
00:29:29,223 --> 00:29:31,161
You didn't notice someone following you?

510
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:34,746
I was thinking abut you. I didn't notice

511
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:36,833
Since you are here

512
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:38,184
I need you to do something

513
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:41,081
There is a maid who has good education in literature.

514
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:42,512
Find her.

515
00:29:42,512 --> 00:29:45,433
If you find her, I won't blame you for today's disobediency

516
00:29:45,974 --> 00:29:46,797
Yes, your majesty

517
00:29:48,493 --> 00:29:50,174
But I'm not smart.

518
00:29:50,174 --> 00:29:51,134
Please show me.

519
00:29:51,597 --> 00:29:53,762
How to test the maid's knowledge?

520
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:56,439
You just asked her, what's the next line of

521
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:57,743
"If the wind understands my heart,"

522
00:30:00,743 --> 00:30:01,429
Yes

523
00:30:06,444 --> 00:30:09,825
They were just talking about lighting up a paper light and wait for the new year to come

524
00:30:10,104 --> 00:30:12,394
But now they all fell asleep

525
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:17,787
It's my bad. I am so sleepy

526
00:30:19,646 --> 00:30:21,487
Today you have good luck. You won several games

527
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:23,830
But please leave us some for the new year

528
00:30:24,109 --> 00:30:25,044
You all are just trying to make me happy

529
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:31,175
I haven't been here for long. I don't know anything about the patterns on clothes.

530
00:30:32,418 --> 00:30:34,022
I want to ask you,

531
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:34,881
a dragon swirling pattern

532
00:30:34,881 --> 00:30:36,515
What kind of people will wear that?

533
00:30:36,515 --> 00:30:38,512
What kind of people will wear that?

534
00:30:39,095 --> 00:30:40,504
Why do you want to know this?

535
00:30:40,974 --> 00:30:43,477
Today's feast, all royal and noble families are invited

536
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:46,558
You were thinking about this?

537
00:30:47,966 --> 00:30:50,147
Dragon swirling pattern is for highest class

538
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,268
Dukes and Earls cannot use them

539
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:54,878
It must be a brother his majesty really favors

540
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,475
The former emperor had many kids

541
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:02,313
But as to someone who can join the feast

542
00:31:02,313 --> 00:31:03,458
which dukes are we talking about?

543
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:04,423
5th Duke and 10th Duke.

544
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:07,665
And 17th Duke.

545
00:31:09,102 --> 00:31:11,071
Although they don't have the same biological mother

546
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:13,504
They are both raised by Empress Dowager

547
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,017
That's why they are very close

548
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:17,876
I heard about this before I entered the Harem

549
00:31:18,923 --> 00:31:22,168
17th Duke is as unworldly as a wild crane or a floating clouds

550
00:31:22,168 --> 00:31:22,804
He is an expert in the classical six arts 
(propriety,music,archery,riding,writing,arithematic)

551
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:25,545
He is one of the best fluter in the capital.

552
00:31:27,277 --> 00:31:28,561
When the former emperor was still alive

553
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:31,552
9 princes of his were fighting for the crown

554
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,545
Only 17th Duke indulge himself in books and poems

555
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:37,873
That makes him a noble and lucky survivor today.

556
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:40,256
Your words makes sense

557
00:31:41,156 --> 00:31:43,388
Sometimes

558
00:31:43,388 --> 00:31:46,139
I will have more blessing not to compete for anything

559
00:31:46,616 --> 00:31:48,583
That's why you are also blessed

560
00:31:49,392 --> 00:31:50,084
I wish so.

561
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:52,085
It's not early. Please go to sleep

562
00:31:58,488 --> 00:32:00,294
His majesty have an edictment. The whole forbidden city is celebrating new year

563
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:02,001
The whole forbidden city is celebrating new year

564
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:04,019
His majesty came up with a couplet

565
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,797
whether you are a eunuch or a maid

566
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:10,861
as long as you can come up with the next line. His majesty will award you

567
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:14,066
Then please tell us about it

568
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,904
Although we are not educated

569
00:32:17,297 --> 00:32:19,945
we can still join all of the rest

570
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,883
Listen carefully

571
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,128
The upper line is "If the wind understands my heart"

572
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:38,116
Anyone knows?

573
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,297
"Then it won't destroy me"

574
00:32:58,271 --> 00:33:01,459
You are distracted. That's why you've already lost.

575
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:04,449
I lost the game

576
00:33:05,397 --> 00:33:07,681
I can't compete with you in chess

577
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,378
Your majesty, the thing you asked me to do

578
00:33:16,378 --> 00:33:18,569
I have tried my best

579
00:33:19,056 --> 00:33:19,957
But...

580
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:22,805
Brother only told you the first line

581
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:24,961
Su Peisheng doesn't know what the second line is.

582
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:26,975
It's a tough job.

583
00:33:27,163 --> 00:33:29,812
If you can't accomplish the task, that means you are getting past it.

584
00:33:30,606 --> 00:33:31,194
Don't get mad, your majesty

585
00:33:32,192 --> 00:33:33,541
You have played chess for quite a long time

586
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:34,397
You must be thirsty

587
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:36,474
If you want to scold me

588
00:33:36,726 --> 00:33:38,037
please scold me after having a cup of tea

589
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:06,529
The tea is made of the snow water on winter plums?

590
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:09,035
I can smell the winter plums in it

591
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,267
Please forgive me, your majesty. It's the scent of me

592
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:14,405
I some how get winter plums scents on me

593
00:34:14,405 --> 00:34:15,572
Sorry that I disturbed you

594
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:17,510
Your majesty's servants

595
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,554
are more and more pretty

596
00:34:19,376 --> 00:34:20,224
When I came back

597
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,727
I will ask my servants

598
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,185
To get the scents of winter plums

599
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,222
I don't recognize you

600
00:34:26,217 --> 00:34:28,184
When did you start serving me?

601
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:33,126
If the wind understands my heart, then it won't destroy me

602
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:36,155
Gardening in Garden of WInter Plums is tough

603
00:34:36,155 --> 00:34:38,268
Thanks to General Director Su

604
00:34:38,268 --> 00:34:40,625
I am fortunate enough

605
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:42,236
to serve you once.

606
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,418
Is it cold on the way here?

607
00:34:46,907 --> 00:34:48,103
The snow has stopped

608
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:51,840
Better than New year eve when my socks and shoes are soaked with water.

609
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:00,308
you came up with a nice idea

610
00:35:01,854 --> 00:35:03,607
I still have work to do in Garden of Winter Plums

611
00:35:03,607 --> 00:35:05,202
Please excuse me.

612
00:35:05,821 --> 00:35:07,371
Garden of Winter Plums has nothing but winter plums

613
00:35:08,755 --> 00:35:11,277
Here in my palace, I need some winter plums scent

614
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:13,080
You can stay

615
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:16,760
Thank you your majesty

616
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,919
What's your name

617
00:35:18,795 --> 00:35:21,007
My name is Yu Yinger

618
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:28,223
Confer Servant Lady upon Yu Yinger,maid in Garden of Winter Plums.

619
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,435
Grant her a residence in Palace of Esscence

620
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:31,757
Yes

621
00:35:32,144 --> 00:35:34,380
May you live forever

622
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:38,152
Even if it's a town house made of jade and gold. I wouldn't want to be there. (A Poem)

623
00:35:39,195 --> 00:35:42,446
I only want to plant a winter plum and indulge in wine in Luoyang City (Poem)

624
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:48,978
You don't understand what his majesty means?

625
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:53,034
I don't understand. Please tell me, Duke

626
00:35:53,897 --> 00:35:54,902
It's a poem written by Li Bai. (It's acutally not Li Bai)

627
00:35:55,494 --> 00:35:57,377
His majesty likes Li Bai's Poem

628
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:01,480
I see. Thank you, Duke.

629
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:06,962
Have a safe trip, Duke

630
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:09,621
Where are you going?

631
00:36:09,911 --> 00:36:11,616
I am going to Internal Affairs Authority

632
00:36:11,616 --> 00:36:13,135
I have to report to House of Respectual Affairs

633
00:36:14,449 --> 00:36:17,006
Since you completed the task, his majesty will award you

634
00:36:17,646 --> 00:36:19,141
It's a huge blessing I don't dare to have

635
00:36:20,252 --> 00:36:21,086
Have a safe trip

636
00:36:21,302 --> 00:36:22,690
It's not a problem if you walk the wrong way

637
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,009
But if you find the wrong one.

638
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:25,520
Then it's a huge problem

639
00:36:35,145 --> 00:36:36,737
Can you sing Kun Opera?

640
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,839
My father is a memeber of a Kun Opera Group

641
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:40,667
That's why I can sing a few lines

642
00:36:45,188 --> 00:36:47,758
You said finding the wrong one?

643
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:49,878
You mean?

644
00:36:49,878 --> 00:36:51,404
Please tell me

645
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:53,926
I was just talking nonsense

646
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,247
A strange thing happened.

647
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:07,163
Anything new?

648
00:37:08,128 --> 00:37:09,602
His majesty somehow

649
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,508
likes a maid from Garden of Winter Plums

650
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,461
First grant her as a servant lady

651
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:16,406
A few days later she was promoted to Promise

652
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,942
Garden of Winter Plums?

653
00:37:20,635 --> 00:37:21,243
Yes

654
00:37:24,461 --> 00:37:26,958
This kind of thing that the emperor suddenly fall in love with a maid happens a lot

655
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:29,954
Nowadays, his majesty really likes her.

656
00:37:30,975 --> 00:37:31,865
Can she beat you?

657
00:37:35,134 --> 00:37:36,142
Almost

658
00:37:37,156 --> 00:37:38,912
I heard she can sing Kun Opera

659
00:37:40,456 --> 00:37:41,513
That's new

660
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:43,707
watching winter plums and listening to opera

661
00:37:43,707 --> 00:37:45,134
I would like it if I were the emperor

662
00:37:46,467 --> 00:37:47,864
But however his majesty likes her

663
00:37:47,864 --> 00:37:49,460
She still came from a humble family

664
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,511
She can never defeat you

665
00:37:50,914 --> 00:37:52,115
I know

666
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:54,949
But Linrong is not happy about this

667
00:37:55,714 --> 00:37:57,344
Right

668
00:37:57,344 --> 00:37:58,290
It's a long time since she eneterd the Harem

669
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,473
She hasn't served his majesty yet.

670
00:38:01,057 --> 00:38:03,071
It's okay that other people served his majesty

671
00:38:03,071 --> 00:38:04,313
But that girl was only a maid

672
00:38:04,313 --> 00:38:05,956
She is 10 times more humble than linrong

673
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,672
Now they are both the same rank

674
00:38:08,672 --> 00:38:10,642
No wonder she feels bad

675
00:38:11,795 --> 00:38:12,919
Linrong hasn't served his majesty for such a long time

676
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:15,467
Is it because she doesn't want to?

677
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:18,855
His majesty doesn't vist the Harem a lot

678
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:21,415
And when he does, he usually go to Princess of Glory

679
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:23,365
and other favorable princess consorts

680
00:38:24,517 --> 00:38:26,719
You know how snobbish the people in the forbidden city can be.

681
00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:30,634
Without his majesty's favor, she can live worse than a servant

682
00:38:31,832 --> 00:38:33,495
Other people can complain about this

683
00:38:33,495 --> 00:38:36,962
You have received constant adoration from his majesty

684
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:40,296
I'm a little scared when I see other people's tragedy

685
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:43,894
What if one day, his majesty doesn't like me anymore

686
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:45,948
You will never lose his majety's favor

687
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,070
because of the love his majesty has with you

688
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,462
not to mention your family's power

689
00:38:51,547 --> 00:38:52,629
I wish so.

690
00:38:56,822 --> 00:38:58,542
Young mistress, the bonus for the Lantern Festival has been delivered to us

691
00:38:58,542 --> 00:38:59,681
Please take a look back home

692
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:01,852
Then I have to leave

693
00:39:23,768 --> 00:39:25,262
Greetings, Precious Shen

694
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:28,067
Thank you, Yu Meimei

695
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:34,590
It's cold and slippery. His majesty is concerned that I might fall.

696
00:39:35,548 --> 00:39:37,230
So he bestowed me a palanquin

697
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:41,750
Please forgive me for not getting down to greet you

698
00:39:42,053 --> 00:39:43,357
Exactly

699
00:39:43,655 --> 00:39:46,640
If you fell, how would you be able to serve his majesty?

700
00:39:48,156 --> 00:39:49,136
Precious Jie Jie

701
00:39:49,741 --> 00:39:51,909
I have just came back from Princess of Glory's place

702
00:39:52,487 --> 00:39:53,846
I was going to the Empress to greet her.

703
00:39:54,766 --> 00:39:57,549
Can you make way for me?

704
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:07,012
