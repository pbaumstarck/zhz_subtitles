3
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:05,063
Meimei just came from Princess of Glory's place

4
00:00:05,063 --> 00:00:06,819
and now is going to the Empress's to give my greetings

5
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:10,479
Not sure if Jie Jie would allow me to go first

6
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:17,212
Cai Yue, allow Promise Yu to go first

7
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:18,715
Let's go

8
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:30,850
She just became a Promise

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,606
Who does she think she is?

10
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:38,043
Talking about a young mistress behind her back. 
That's not how you should behave

11
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:41,050
Your servant will not do it again.

12
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,574
She is favored by the Emperor

13
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:46,617
The more you gossip, the more trouble you'll get into

14
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:50,437
Be patient and stay out of trouble. See?

15
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:51,649
Yes

16
00:00:52,994 --> 00:00:53,978
Let's go

17
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,519
Yesterday at Mother's palace

18
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:01,587
Ying'er sang "be together forever" very well

19
00:01:01,587 --> 00:01:04,159
I granted her a name

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,231
"Lady of an exquisite voice". What do you think, Empress?

21
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:09,554
She earns it

22
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:14,208
Your majesty. It's time to flip over a name board

23
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:20,816
I heard that not every Princess Consort has served you

24
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:23,634
Lingering Smile has been sick

25
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:26,293
Lingering Chun is too young

26
00:01:26,293 --> 00:01:29,171
She doesn't understand anything about the world. Is there anyone else?

27
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:31,629
There is a Promise An

28
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,114
Then I'll go with her.

29
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:39,624
Young mistress. You are back!

30
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:43,563
Young mistress. Where did you go?

31
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:45,470
I couldn't find you. I was so worried!

32
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,165
Where else can I be

33
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:49,424
I was just visiting Precious Shen

34
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:52,187
Didn't the Green House keep saying

35
00:01:52,187 --> 00:01:54,461
that hey didn't have these precious flowers?

36
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:56,617
Why did they sent so many to us today?

37
00:01:57,135 --> 00:01:58,918
Congratulations, young mistress

38
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,334
House of Respecful Affairs has delivered the good news.

39
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:02,527
Tonight it's you that will serve his majesty

40
00:02:04,628 --> 00:02:05,712
What?

41
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:07,820
Today is your big day!

42
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,841
His majesty flipped your nameboard

43
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,998
As soon as the news came out,

44
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,637
servants from the Green House came and sent us so many flowers

45
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:17,680
The Imperial Kitchen also sent us some Ejiao 
(a kind of collagen supplements, donkey-hide gelatin)

46
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:19,935
It's almost time

47
00:02:19,935 --> 00:02:22,788
I'll help you clean up

48
00:02:23,681 --> 00:02:27,270
I thought his majesty didn't even remember me

49
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:32,678
Don't get nervous, young mistress

50
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:35,624
His majesty is still reviewing the officials' memos

51
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:37,024
He will be a little late

52
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:40,874
In a bit, we will carry you inside

53
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:45,180
You can lie down and wait for his majesty to come

54
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:50,924
Young mistress. What's wrong?

55
00:02:50,924 --> 00:02:55,552
Gugu. I'm scared

56
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:58,024
Don't be afraid

57
00:03:58,526 --> 00:03:59,443
What's wrong?

58
00:04:00,477 --> 00:04:03,098
I, I

59
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:06,450
I'm not a mean guy

60
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,675
The maids haven't taught you the protocols?

61
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:17,428
I don't like to force anyone. Another day.

62
00:04:17,428 --> 00:04:18,820
Su Peisheng!

63
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:22,635
Yes.

64
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:24,301
Carry her out

65
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:27,954
Bring Promise Yu Here.

66
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:30,476
Yes

67
00:04:40,306 --> 00:04:43,629
What the heck. I've never had to do such an ill-boding task.

68
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:45,334
The consort who was carried in is the exact same as when she's carried out.

69
00:04:45,334 --> 00:04:46,673
The consort who was carried in is the exact same as when she's carried out.

70
00:05:19,116 --> 00:05:22,298
It's so late. Who is still singing?

71
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:26,268
It must be the Lady with an Exquisite Voice

72
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:29,804
It's not appropriate to sing loudly in the Forbidden City in the middle of the night.

73
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,412
But still

74
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:35,413
His majesty has been busy with politics

75
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:38,375
he needs someone lively to serve him.

76
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:41,832
There is a Precious Shen...

77
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:44,373
Yes. We met her during the audition.

78
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:46,713
Modest and prudent

79
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,898
What his majesty needs is someone like her.

80
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,230
The empress will take care of the harem

81
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,464
The Empress Dowager should just enjoy life

82
00:05:54,464 --> 00:05:56,762
The healthy way to live is to not worry

83
00:05:58,784 --> 00:06:01,900
He is my son

84
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,269
The emperor has a huge harem

85
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:06,922
So long as they do not overstep the boundaries, everything would be fine

86
00:06:06,922 --> 00:06:10,186
Otherwise I must still keep an eye out.

87
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:17,615
I heard that Meimei knows how to sing Kun Opera

88
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:19,315
The Emperor really enjoys listening to it

89
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:22,260
The Emperor is busy handling state affairs everyday

90
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,264
A song from Meimei would most definitely help him relax

91
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:28,737
No wonder Meimei gains the Emperor's favor

92
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:30,892
What songs do you know how to sing?

93
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:35,210
Peony Pavilion. I was taught by my father

94
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,172
Do you know how to sing "Return the jade intact to the Zhao state"? (meaning return something intact to its rightful owner)

95
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,676
That song?

96
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:49,677
Promise An must sing that herself

97
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:52,936
So that she can move her audience by telling them her own story

98
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:56,143
The Empress put so much effort into doing her this favor

99
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:59,039
Yet she made such a joke out of herself

100
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:02,075
The Empress must have grown many wrinkles from anger

101
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:04,956
How could she compare to Niangniang's youth and beauty?

102
00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:07,662
Meimei, your words are really sweet

103
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:14,472
This jade wheel is from my brother

104
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:16,604
He sent through others from outside

105
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:19,074
It is top quality jade

106
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:22,351
Using it to massage your face could keep you looking young

107
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:25,264
I'll give it to you

108
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:29,348
Thanks, Niangniang

109
00:07:34,632 --> 00:07:37,190
Promise An is of a lowborn family and couldn't win the Emperor's favor

110
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,657
Her life is finished

111
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:39,798
Such a pity

112
00:07:39,798 --> 00:07:41,506
If I were carried out of the Emperor's palace like that

113
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:42,561
I would not be able to face anyone

114
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,599
Yet she's acting as if nothing happened

115
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:45,462
Yes

116
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:52,831
Servants should not discuss the matters of Mistresses

117
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,146
If there is someone

118
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:56,524
who belittles their mistress

119
00:07:56,524 --> 00:07:57,693
I will report it to the Empress right away

120
00:07:57,693 --> 00:08:00,594
and throw him/her out of palace! Understand?

121
00:08:00,594 --> 00:08:01,740
Yes

122
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,791
I was wrong

123
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:15,370
Greetings, Precious Shen. Greetings, Lingering Smile.

124
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:17,805
Jiejie, sit down

125
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:20,922
Are you OK?

126
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:24,865
I'm fine. Thanks for your kindness

127
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,857
The next time will be alright.

128
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:31,428
We still have time in the future.

129
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:36,727
You two still have a future. I don't.

130
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:52,652
Young mistress, although it is February

131
00:08:52,652 --> 00:08:54,434
you still need to pay attention to your health.

132
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,461
These days are even colder than in January.

133
00:08:58,339 --> 00:08:59,992
Young mistress has been sewing all day

134
00:08:59,992 --> 00:09:02,539
Hold this stove to keep warm.

135
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,610
It's still cold out,

136
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,442
yet the Internal Affairs Authority doesn't provide enough winter clothes.

137
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:12,798
We have to work on most of them ourselves.

138
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,637
This morning I followed your order

139
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:18,352
and brought some cakes to Young mistress An's place.

140
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:20,496
They were also doing needle work.

141
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:22,614
They said they're afraid that the money they receive monthly won't be enough

142
00:09:22,614 --> 00:09:25,343
By doing needle work they can ask eunuchs to exchange them for money outside the palace

143
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:27,175
Both are ranked Promises

144
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:29,287
Why is Promise Yu living so luxuriously?

145
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:30,354
Don't gossip behind people's back.

146
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:33,281
Mei jie jie has already said

147
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,688
The Emperor wants to reduce the expenses in the palace.

148
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:38,770
which palace isn't doing some needle work to supplement their expenses?

149
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,444
Fortunately, we still have enough to spare

150
00:09:41,444 --> 00:09:44,453
Huan Bi, bring some money to Promise An's place tomorrow.

151
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:47,645
She'll need to spend more on clothing when spring comes around

152
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:48,402
Yes.

153
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,584
Who is here this late?

154
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:53,330
Hurry up and go see.

155
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:02,189
Young mistress Chun, why are you here alone?

156
00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:03,304
Please hurry come in.

157
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:04,696
Young mistress, Young mistress Chun comes.

158
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:08,916
Chun er, what happened?

159
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:12,110
Don't be scared...

160
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,657
Jie jie, I'm scared.
Bring her some tea.

161
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:14,748
Don't be scared...

162
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,396
Chun er don't cry...

163
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:18,800
Drink some milk tea and tell me what happened slowly

164
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,367
Don't cry.

165
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:24,918
Here.

166
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:34,120
Just now Lingering Xin and I were going back to our place

167
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,237
There was an unexpected gust of wind and

168
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,206
the lantern that the palace maid was holding caught on fire

169
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:42,329
and just then, Promise Yu passed by on the carriage

170
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:44,910
and the fire startled the horse in front of the carriage

171
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,491
and caused some shaking.

172
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,234
But I saw clearly

173
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,245
the palace horse is well trained

174
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:54,142
the shaking was insignificant.

175
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:57,635
But Promise Yu wouldn't let it go

176
00:10:57,635 --> 00:11:01,322
Lingering Xin Jiejie wouldn't back down either

177
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:03,963
Lingering Xin has served the Emperor for a long time.

178
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,446
Her rank is also higher than that of Promise Yu.

179
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:08,979
She doesn't have to be humble before Promise Yu.

180
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:11,661
Promise Yu is in the Emporer's favor and has Princess of Glory behind her back

181
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:12,643
She's been acting aggressive and willful

182
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:15,504
Xin Jiejie has been unhappy about Promise Yu for some time

183
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:17,458
They argued and,

184
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,245
Promise Yu, in a fit of anger,

185
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,340
ordered that Xin Jiejie be locked in the Bureau of Cautious Punishment.

186
00:11:23,524 --> 00:11:24,305
The Bureau of Cautious Punishment?

187
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:28,699
That's where servants who make mistakes are kept and punished

188
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:31,205
How can Lingering Xin be put in there?

189
00:11:31,205 --> 00:11:34,363
The Emperor and the Empress haven't stepped in yet to take care of the matter?

190
00:11:35,415 --> 00:11:36,276
Promise Yu said

191
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:38,640
If anyone informs the Emperor or the Empress about this

192
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,611
she would punish the director of the Bureau of Cautious Punishment.

193
00:11:41,597 --> 00:11:44,217
Yu shi is so lawless. What she has done is unheard of.

194
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:49,022
Jiejie, what to do now?

195
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:52,489
Don't cry...

196
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:54,617
Xiao Yun Zi!

197
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:55,803
I'm here.

198
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,467
I'll let Xiao Yun Zi take you back first

199
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:04,409
You've been startled, you need to rest well.

200
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:06,729
Tomorrow I'll discuss with Mei jiejie.

201
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:08,937
Then ask her to notify the Empress to take further action.

202
00:12:10,587 --> 00:12:11,485
Xiao Yun Zi.

203
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:12,117
Here.

204
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:13,296
Escort Lingering Chun back.

205
00:12:13,296 --> 00:12:14,191
Yes.

206
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,595
Poor girl

207
00:12:27,595 --> 00:12:30,872
At such a young age she has to stay in the palace and experience such frightening things

208
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:32,832
No matter what they are both ranked Lingerings

209
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:35,530
yet they are bullied by a Promise to this extent!

210
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:38,867
In the palace, not having the Emperor's favor is so pitiful.

211
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,596
Yu has let her blessings make her arrogant. Singing loudly at night,

212
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:46,054
and lawlessly putting Lingering Xin into the Bureau of Cautious Punishment at her own will.

213
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:49,819
In my opinion, this is a good thing.

214
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:51,353
A good thing?

215
00:12:51,743 --> 00:12:53,402
Precisely

216
00:12:53,402 --> 00:12:56,168
Her sudden favor from the Emperor has already angered many concubines.

217
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:57,753
And yet she behaves rashly with no decency.

218
00:12:57,753 --> 00:13:00,203
Isn't she digging her own grave?

219
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:07,855
In this whole palace, only you can be so happy and carefree.

220
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:09,623
Outside is a chaotic mess

221
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,980
What happened?

222
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,249
The Empress Dowager has given the order

223
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:15,973
to release Lingering Xin and comfort her

224
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:18,424
by taking away Promise Yu's title of "Lady of an exquisite voice"

225
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:20,306
and restricting her to her own quarters to self-reflect for half a month.

226
00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:22,245
The order came from the Empress Dowager?

227
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:22,958
Yes.

228
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,444
Why didn't the Emperor and the Empress take care of this

229
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:27,438
but the Empress Dowager instead?

230
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:30,128
The Emperor is busy with state affairs. He doesn't pay attention to these small things.

231
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:32,672
The Empress was at the Empress Dowager's palace when they received word of the matter

232
00:13:32,672 --> 00:13:34,123
That's how the matter fell into the Empress Dowager's hands

233
00:13:34,123 --> 00:13:35,945
The Empress Dowager is at once both strict and merciful.

234
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:37,787
She's using this small punishment for a severe wrongdoing to give her a warning

235
00:13:37,787 --> 00:13:40,619
Yes, though Yu is still a Promise,

236
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,386
she lost her title,

237
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:44,666
her status is much lower than it was before

238
00:13:59,313 --> 00:14:01,293
My calligraphy is nice and smooth today. (she wrote "Satisfactory")

239
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:03,529
Keep this one.

240
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:04,192
Yes.

241
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,924
Yu has been punished. She'll give it a rest for awhile.

242
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:11,346
Niangniang can do calligraphy smoothly with this peace of mind

243
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:13,927
The Empress Dowager cares for your wellbeing the most indeed

244
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:16,079
Promise Yu is at the peak of her favor with the Emperor

245
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,302
If I punish her at this time

246
00:14:18,302 --> 00:14:21,000
the Emperor may request me to be more merciful toward her.

247
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,943
rather than putting myself in a difficult position where I need to compromise my authority or my relationship with the Emperor

248
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:31,456
the best way is to have the Empress Dowager take care of the matter. No one can question the outcome.

249
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:33,059
Niang Niang thinks thoroughly.

250
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:37,958
The weather is so nice now.

251
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,121
Young mistress no longer drinks the medicine as much

252
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:42,033
Look like your health is improving a great deal

253
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:45,035
So long as everything is peaceful

254
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:47,298
it's fine to not drink the medicine

255
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:49,583
Young mistress has been unwilling to get better

256
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,782
Now that you've finally stopped taking the medicine

257
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:53,036
you should take a walk under the sun.

258
00:14:53,036 --> 00:14:55,324
This way your appearance can get brighter.

259
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:57,217
Young mistress said a few days ago that

260
00:14:57,217 --> 00:15:00,582
you wanted to build a swing near the palace gardens outside Palace of Shattered Jade

261
00:15:00,582 --> 00:15:02,083
Xiao Yun Zi has finish building the swing

262
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,205
That area is full of apricot flowers.

263
00:15:04,205 --> 00:15:05,781
Why don't the young mistress go take a look?

264
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:11,504
"Sitting in the shade of apricot flowers, playing the flute until dawn"

265
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,033
You two insist on me going outside, huh?

266
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:18,335
Then let's go.

267
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:20,615
Liuzhu

268
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:21,403
Bring me my flute.

269
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:22,633
Hurry!

270
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,256
Who are you, royal sir?

271
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:04,677
Can you guess?

272
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:09,909
Is it possible that you are Emperor?

273
00:17:13,594 --> 00:17:14,886
You are a Duke?

274
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,173
Have you heard of the Duke of Fruit (17th prince)?

275
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,901
Are you really the Duke of Fruit?

276
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:28,163
Have you ever seen..me?

277
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:34,222
Since I entered the palace, 
I have never even seen the Emperor.

278
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:44,687
Then how can you know that I'm not the Duke of Fruit?

279
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:49,611
It seems that age doesn't quite match.

280
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:54,153
A person's age and appearance are often inconsistent.

281
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:57,946
If you say so.

282
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:02,248
I am a Lingering from the House of Zhen. Greetings, Duke.

283
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,814
You are the Lingering who has been sick?

284
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:09,283
How can Your Highness know the affairs of the Inner Palace?

285
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:14,026
I heard...from my royal sister-in-law (the Empress).

286
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,993
On New Year's Eve

287
00:18:15,993 --> 00:18:20,158
His Majesty asked about you. I was present.

288
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:22,683
I see.

289
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:25,439
Are you feeling better?

290
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:29,088
Why don't you put on warmer clothing?

291
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:30,650
You are too kind

292
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:34,609
I am much better now.

293
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:37,690
Liuzhu, this is the Duke of Fruit.

294
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:42,275
Greetings, Duke.

295
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:46,590
Just now you played the piece "Heaven Image of Apricot Flowers"

296
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,533
It suits the surroundings very well.

297
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:51,336
Are you very familiar with this piece?

298
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:55,702
If you use a clay flute to play it in the evening of spring

299
00:18:55,702 --> 00:19:00,697
the song will be even more charming.

300
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:03,384
By using the vertical flute to play just now

301
00:19:03,384 --> 00:19:06,283
you have lessened the melancholy of the song

302
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:11,423
and have added some liveliness that takes away the winter wind.

303
00:19:11,423 --> 00:19:15,605
I'm still lacking in skill. I hope the Duke will forgive the flaws.

304
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:16,763
You play very well.

305
00:19:18,134 --> 00:19:20,110
But when you reached the line that sings

306
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,018
"the beautiful blossoms by the shore makes me unwilling to depart "

307
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:27,130
the sound of the flute became somber

308
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,333
sounding much like a suppressed sob

309
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,695
Is it that you are missing your home?

310
00:19:35,535 --> 00:19:37,517
"The musician plays a subtle mistake, and Sir Zhou is aware"

311
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:40,546
The Duke's music ears are even better than that of Zhou Gong Jin (famous general and musician during Han Dynasty).

312
00:19:43,836 --> 00:19:50,163
I haven't heard such beautiful flute music in a very long time

313
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:57,028
Not since..Empress Chun Yuan passed away

314
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:59,373
Never since then have I heard such beautiful music

315
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:02,213
I dare not accept such praise

316
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:05,341
I dare not compete with Empress Zhun Yuan.

317
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:09,956
I shall head back to my quarters now.

318
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,163
Please do as you wish.

319
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:13,075
Ok.

320
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:35,228
Young mistress, you are back.

321
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:37,905
Pei'er

322
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:40,704
Find out for me

323
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:42,594
if the Duke of Fruit came to the palace today or not.

324
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:43,872
Yes.

325
00:20:46,214 --> 00:20:47,061
Young mistress is worried

326
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:49,232
that the person discussing flute music with you just now is not the Duke of Fruit?

327
00:20:51,748 --> 00:20:52,631
What do you think?

328
00:20:55,356 --> 00:20:56,699
It's best to be cautious.

329
00:21:02,498 --> 00:21:03,537
Greetings, Your Majesty.

330
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:05,424
Rise

331
00:21:05,424 --> 00:21:06,174
Thank you.

332
00:21:06,174 --> 00:21:07,907
Why did you come so early?

333
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:09,820
Your Majesty had people inform me early this morning

334
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,204
that you have an original artwork by Wu Dao Zi

335
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:12,731
I couldn't wait to see

336
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,128
so I came here immediately

337
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:17,542
No need to hurry. The painting cannot run away.

338
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,952
Oh, but you see, famous paintings are like beautiful women.

339
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:21,151
I cannot be late, even if it's just a second.

340
00:21:21,151 --> 00:21:24,005
If you love beauty that much, why haven't you married yet?

341
00:21:24,676 --> 00:21:26,693
I was planning to get married,

342
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:28,446
but just now at the door of your palace

343
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:30,817
I saw a pretty girl raining flower blossoms (crying)

344
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:32,236
and that was enough to frighten me out of my marriage plans

345
00:21:32,236 --> 00:21:34,846
- Su Pei Sheng.
- Your Majesty.

346
00:21:34,846 --> 00:21:36,544
Yu is here?

347
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:39,126
In response to Your Majesty, Promise Yu came early morning

348
00:21:39,126 --> 00:21:40,838
crying, asking to see Your Majesty.

349
00:21:40,838 --> 00:21:42,810
I informed her that the Emperor was not here.

350
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,970
She cried for a long while before she left

351
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,984
Just ignore her.

352
00:21:45,984 --> 00:21:47,037
Yes.

353
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:48,340
By the way,

354
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,456
I remember there is a wonderful jade vertical flute

355
00:21:51,456 --> 00:21:52,780
You find it for me.

356
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,519
Yes.

357
00:21:54,553 --> 00:21:55,664
Where did you go, Royal brother?

358
00:21:56,593 --> 00:21:58,547
I went to visit the Empress Dowager

359
00:21:58,547 --> 00:22:01,953
and passed by the royal garden on the way back so I took a walk by myself.

360
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:05,716
unintentionally leaving you here to listen to a woman crying.

361
00:22:05,716 --> 00:22:07,435
Love at first sight in the Garden of Winter Plums.

362
00:22:07,435 --> 00:22:09,985
How does my Royal brother like this girl from the Yu family?

363
00:22:09,985 --> 00:22:11,390
So So

364
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,172
Not as gentle and charming as that night

365
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:15,371
in the Garden of Winter Plums

366
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:18,749
Which is why they say, it's better to miss one another than to actually meet

367
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:22,754
Come, let's go appreciate the painting.

368
00:22:28,474 --> 00:22:31,158
In response to young mistress, the Duke of Fruit did come to the palace early today.

369
00:22:31,158 --> 00:22:33,617
Now he is appreciating a painting with the Emperor in the Hall of a Resting Soul.

370
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:38,409
I heard that the Duke looks very stoic...

371
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:39,445
and nearly 40 years old?

372
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:40,212
Not at all

373
00:22:40,212 --> 00:22:42,738
The Duke was born in the 35th year of Kangxi's reign.

374
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,475
He should be around 25 or 26 years old now.

375
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:47,034
A Duke who is around 40 years old...

376
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:48,819
That must be the Duke of Perseverance (Duke of Heng)

377
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:50,152
He is down to earth

378
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:52,240
and loves to joke with us servants

379
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,204
How about His Majesty?

380
00:22:54,204 --> 00:22:56,243
I don't know.

381
00:22:56,243 --> 00:22:58,268
His Majesty rarely comes to the Harem.

382
00:22:58,268 --> 00:23:00,810
When he does come there are a lot of people surrounding him

383
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:04,332
My status is lowly so I can't see His Majesty.

384
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:07,152
You're right. No matter where His Majesty goes,

385
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,280
there are a lot of people who follow him .

386
00:23:11,044 --> 00:23:13,198
You can leave. I'm tired.

387
00:23:13,198 --> 00:23:14,195
Yes.

388
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,283
I sympathize with what has befallen Meimei.

389
00:23:18,876 --> 00:23:21,376
But this was the Empress Dowager's decree.

390
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:23,511
Even His Majesty can't do anything.

391
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:26,222
I have served in the palace since I was young.

392
00:23:26,222 --> 00:23:28,897
I know that the Empress Dowager has a soft temper and is gracious to all.

393
00:23:28,897 --> 00:23:30,512
She never gets involved in palace affairs

394
00:23:30,512 --> 00:23:33,577
But why does the Empress Dowager not let go

395
00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:35,522
of a small mistake I made

396
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:38,747
There must be someone instigating her anger.

397
00:23:38,747 --> 00:23:42,886
Whether that's true or not

398
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:46,795
at least your half month restriction has passed.

399
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:49,247
The Empress Dowager cannot say any more regarding this matter

400
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:53,266
But... but His Majesty still refuses to see me.

401
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:58,446
That's true... and if this continues

402
00:23:58,446 --> 00:24:01,571
I fear His Majesty will probably forget you.

403
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:08,674
Niang Niang, please save me.

404
00:24:08,674 --> 00:24:10,443
I don't want to live isolated in the deep palace

405
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:13,197
I don't want to go back to the Garden of Winter Plums 
and slave away at others' wills

406
00:24:13,197 --> 00:24:14,441
Niang Niang, please!

407
00:24:16,473 --> 00:24:17,468
Yes.

408
00:24:17,468 --> 00:24:19,427
Since the person you want to see is His Majesty

409
00:24:19,427 --> 00:24:20,949
If he refuses, Meimei should naturally

410
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:23,413
find other solutions so that he does not refuse.

411
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:25,593
"It's harder to be cold and detached when you look someone in the eye"

412
00:24:25,593 --> 00:24:28,687
His Majesty won't be heartless toward you when you see him.

413
00:24:28,687 --> 00:24:32,817
But... but I don't know what to do...

414
00:24:32,817 --> 00:24:37,722
Do what you are good at.

415
00:24:43,452 --> 00:24:44,887
Niang Niang, thank you for your advice.

416
00:24:44,887 --> 00:24:48,098
Songzhi, escort Promise Yu out.

417
00:24:48,098 --> 00:24:50,469
Yes. Promise Yu, this way.

418
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:56,689
Niang Niang,

419
00:24:56,689 --> 00:24:59,169
This Promise Yu had gotten much attention from the Emperor

420
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:02,199
Without her, you would have one less person to compete with

421
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:05,322
Why help her?

422
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:09,620
It was the Empress Dowager who punished her, not the Emperor

423
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,063
If one day the Emperor thinks of her again

424
00:25:12,063 --> 00:25:15,150
better that she is indebted to me

425
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,324
so that she will follow me without question

426
00:25:18,324 --> 00:25:21,256
and help me split the Emperor's love away from Precious Shen

427
00:25:21,256 --> 00:25:24,212
Niang Niang, this Precious Shen has just entered the palace not so long ago

428
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:25,789
She doesn't have stable footing here yet.

429
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:30,026
Niang Niang, I think perhaps you need not worry so much

430
00:25:30,026 --> 00:25:31,460
Yes, she JUST entered the palace

431
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,876
and already she has somehow gotten the Emperor to allow her to learn how to manage the Inner Palace.

432
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:40,307
This is what makes me worry the most

433
00:25:55,727 --> 00:25:58,093
Stop. You are all to go back to the Hall of a Resting Soul.

434
00:25:58,093 --> 00:26:00,032
I'll take a walk by myself

435
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:02,860
Your Majesty, her Empress Dowager has just commanded me

436
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,338
to serve you attentively

437
00:26:04,338 --> 00:26:05,694
If I don't go with you

438
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:07,919
then aren't I digging my own grave?

439
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,981
You are digging your own grave right now.

440
00:26:12,034 --> 00:26:12,616
Uh...Lower the palanquin.

441
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:21,821
Don't mention this to anyone.

442
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:22,534
Yes

443
00:26:23,923 --> 00:26:24,815
Go

444
00:26:26,787 --> 00:26:28,052
Higher?

445
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:30,265
A little

446
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,740
I knew you'd be scared

447
00:26:37,883 --> 00:26:38,721
Later I'll push you

448
00:26:39,512 --> 00:26:41,681
Alright! I am not afraid of anything.

449
00:26:56,378 --> 00:26:58,754
Liuzhu! You dare to play tricks behind my back

450
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:01,732
Your Highness...

451
00:27:01,732 --> 00:27:03,872
If you're scared, step down

452
00:27:05,396 --> 00:27:08,281
I'm not scared. You can push as you like

453
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:13,059
Higher!

454
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,321
Go higher!

455
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:47,666
Young mistress!

456
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:49,639
Greetings, Duke.

457
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:51,821
Young mistress, are you Ok?

458
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:55,113
Why are you shy now?

459
00:27:55,113 --> 00:27:57,955
Were you not a brave heroine just a second ago?

460
00:27:57,955 --> 00:27:59,558
I was improper.

461
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:02,877
I had not known that the Duke enjoys silently spying on people from behind.

462
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:06,764
Ah. You are blaming ME for being improper.

463
00:28:07,461 --> 00:28:09,478
I was just passing by

464
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:13,178
and remembered Lingering's flute piece from that day

465
00:28:13,178 --> 00:28:16,324
I hoped to run into you here again so that I might enjoy that beautiful music once more

466
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:20,513
But I did not bring my flute with me today

467
00:28:21,638 --> 00:28:23,679
Then I can only wait for next time

468
00:28:34,404 --> 00:28:35,873
This area is full of apricot blossoms.

469
00:28:37,332 --> 00:28:40,441
Your piece from last time was also about apricot blossoms

470
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:42,745
Do you like apricot blossoms very much?

471
00:28:42,745 --> 00:28:46,396
Apricot blossoms are not as vibrant as peach blossoms

472
00:28:46,396 --> 00:28:48,101
nor as lofty as winter plum blossoms

473
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,703
they are particularly warm and serene

474
00:28:51,387 --> 00:28:54,855
People are like flowers, just as flowers are comparable to people.

475
00:28:55,914 --> 00:28:58,472
Only those who are warm and serene

476
00:28:58,472 --> 00:29:01,776
would like warm and serene flowers

477
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:04,091
But I don't actually like apricot blossoms

478
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:06,828
Oh? Do tell.

479
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:10,959
Apricot blossoms are beautiful, yes, but the fruit is very sour.

480
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,468
what's more, it's kernal is extremely bitter.

481
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:16,257
if a person's character and life experiences are all beautiful in its beginnings but meet a tragic and downtrodden end

482
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:17,726
then what is the purpose?

483
00:29:18,555 --> 00:29:19,961
if that were the case, i'd rather choose to be a pine or cypress

484
00:29:19,961 --> 00:29:23,242
an evergreen tree that stays constant, despite being without blossoms and without fruits.

485
00:29:23,242 --> 00:29:25,474
I've never heard of such insights

486
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:27,305
It is rather new and thoughtful

487
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,801
I spoke merely nonsense, apologies for my silliness.

488
00:29:33,077 --> 00:29:36,744
I've disturbed you today.

489
00:29:38,745 --> 00:29:40,507
I have two flute scores

490
00:29:40,507 --> 00:29:43,410
five days later, at the same hour

491
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,835
I will take them here to appreciate them with you

492
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:48,808
I do hope Lingering will come to meet me.

493
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,796
"Obedience is better than politeness." (she agrees)

494
00:30:05,032 --> 00:30:08,430
I have one request that I hope the Duke can agree to.

495
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,231
Go on

496
00:30:11,408 --> 00:30:13,734
It's inappropriate for me to have met you like this.

497
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:16,728
please don't let others know.

498
00:30:16,728 --> 00:30:18,508
To avoid damaging each other's unpolluted reputation.

499
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:21,608
Since it's a fact that our reputations are unpolluted, 
 who can damage it?

500
00:30:21,608 --> 00:30:23,340
Your highness may not be aware

501
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:26,281
You and I are upright and honest

502
00:30:26,943 --> 00:30:29,004
But in the Harem, 
 the more mouths, the more gossip.

503
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,065
I don't want to stir up trouble without cause.

504
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:33,032
Okay.

505
00:30:33,676 --> 00:30:35,025
Thank you, Duke.

506
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:03,674
Who is on the outside?

507
00:31:04,922 --> 00:31:07,839
There is no one. 
Young mistress, is everything alright?

508
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,638
He and I are separated by our status. 
 How can he possibly be my soul mate?

509
00:31:20,507 --> 00:31:22,697
Young mistress, you must be tired from reading.

510
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:24,456
Why don't you rest for a while?

511
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:26,873
Ugh, the paint on this table has come off too.

512
00:31:26,873 --> 00:31:28,693
but Internal Affairs Authority doesn't bother to come repair it.

513
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,296
Xiao Yun Zi went to address this issue a few days ago.

514
00:31:32,296 --> 00:31:35,355
I imagine they will come repair it in a few days

515
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,783
Your Majesty, please take a break.

516
00:32:29,387 --> 00:32:30,877
Your Majesty, why did you stop playing?

517
00:32:30,877 --> 00:32:33,407
I had been listening with respectful attention.

518
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:36,746
I don't play very well and so should stop playing.

519
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:41,056
The flute music of Empress Chun Yuan was the best in the Palace.

520
00:32:41,056 --> 00:32:44,857
and now there is someone who plays just as well as her

521
00:32:44,857 --> 00:32:46,898
Your Majesty means the 17th Duke?

522
00:32:48,283 --> 00:32:50,844
17th Duke is best at playing the (horizontal) flute.

523
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:53,920
Su Pei Sheng.

524
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,622
Yes.

525
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:55,856
Go to ask 17th brother to come.

526
00:32:55,856 --> 00:32:57,096
Yes.

527
00:33:11,954 --> 00:33:12,699
You were gone an entire afternoon,

528
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,506
why do you look so unfortunate?

529
00:33:14,506 --> 00:33:16,352
I went to the Internal Affairs Authority,

530
00:33:16,352 --> 00:33:18,372
and got a lot of mocking words for no reason.

531
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,293
We're just asking them to fix a table

532
00:33:20,293 --> 00:33:21,838
not like we're requesting them for our monthly salary

533
00:33:21,838 --> 00:33:23,921
how come we've gone so many times and still no success?

534
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:25,308
Princess of Glory has the upper hand in the palace

535
00:33:25,308 --> 00:33:27,801
her followers, those dogs who do nothing but bully the weak

536
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:29,500
have made it a point to target the Palace of Shattered Jade

537
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,329
It's fine that they mock me

538
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:32,803
but they even insult the young mistress

539
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,052
and she has to unfairly bear the grunt of those ugly words

540
00:33:35,052 --> 00:33:36,819
Those bastards in the Internal Affairs Authority dare to be so lawless?

541
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:39,040
In the winter they don't give us our goal

542
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,982
Now they don't even come to repair a table corner

543
00:33:41,592 --> 00:33:43,588
shhhh...the young mistress is inside

544
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,182
if she hears you it will make her sad

545
00:33:45,182 --> 00:33:48,644
What shall we do? we have a long time ahead of us...

546
00:33:48,644 --> 00:33:51,102
Us servants can make do

547
00:33:51,102 --> 00:33:53,633
But my young mistress...
young mistress, how can she bear this unfair treatment?

548
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:55,683
This Huang Gui Quan (eunuch in charge of Internal Affairs) relies on the fact that he's a distant relative of Princess of Glory

549
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:56,521
all he does is bully people!

550
00:33:56,521 --> 00:33:57,210
my dear lady, my dear lady

551
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,729
please calm down and lower your voice

552
00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:06,881
If the Internal Affairs Authority is busy, let's just make do with this table

553
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:09,143
it's not a big deal anyway

554
00:34:09,143 --> 00:34:10,812
Yes

555
00:34:10,812 --> 00:34:13,278
regarding what just happened, neither of us heard anything.

556
00:34:13,278 --> 00:34:15,652
don't scold them a word

557
00:34:15,652 --> 00:34:17,393
yes

558
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:20,953
Serving a young mistress like me

559
00:34:22,046 --> 00:34:24,499
has truly caused you guys much pain

560
00:34:25,728 --> 00:34:28,094
Young mistress, why say such a thing?

561
00:34:28,094 --> 00:34:29,405
your servant dare not make you feel this way

562
00:34:29,405 --> 00:34:31,734
I have never thought that serving you

563
00:34:31,734 --> 00:34:32,939
has wronged me or caused me grief

564
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,822
In the Harem, flocking to the side of powerful people is a normal act

565
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:43,604
of course they wouldn't take a sickly consort with no favor from the Emperor seriously

566
00:34:43,604 --> 00:34:46,863
My Royal brother must have heard beautiful flute music somewhere

567
00:34:46,863 --> 00:34:49,156
to make you so obsessed with flute music all of a sudden

568
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:52,323
These days you've already listen to all of the court musicians

569
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:53,399
who can play a flute.

570
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:58,294
"like scratching an itchy foot when you are wearing boots" it cannot be compared, and cannot satiate my desire.

571
00:34:58,294 --> 00:35:02,235
Is it that difficult for you to hear this person play again for you?

572
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:07,340
Can I ask...who this beauty might be?

573
00:35:10,395 --> 00:35:11,916
You are too clever.

574
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:18,833
Promise Yu, the Emperor and the Duke are inside

575
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:20,329
and won't see any consorts.

576
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:21,742
Every time I come

577
00:35:21,742 --> 00:35:23,889
you tell me that His Majesty is with the Duke

578
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:26,528
do you think I am that easy to lie to?

579
00:35:26,528 --> 00:35:28,147
your servant speaks the truth

580
00:35:28,147 --> 00:35:29,457
If young mistress won't believe me

581
00:35:29,457 --> 00:35:31,143
I cannot do anything about it

582
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:36,041
Then Xia Gong Gong, please go announce me one more time

583
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,958
I've already informed young mistress,

584
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,771
The Emperor is with the Duke

585
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,637
and has commanded that he will see no consorts

586
00:35:41,637 --> 00:35:44,981
what's the purpose of just making things difficult for us servants?

587
00:35:51,480 --> 00:36:03,793
"Wake up from the dream by the chirrup of orioles"

588
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:16,598
"The spring sceneries pluck at the heartstrings everywhere."

589
00:36:34,558 --> 00:36:37,143
I heard that Promise Yu knelt in front of the Hall of a Resting Soul for nearly the entire night.

590
00:36:37,143 --> 00:36:38,706
That's why the heart of His Majesty became soft.

591
00:36:38,706 --> 00:36:41,829
It's not because of kneeling but because of singing.

592
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:44,270
I heard that she's nearly lost her voice from singing all night.

593
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,202
Regardless, she has gained the Emperor's favor again.

594
00:36:47,202 --> 00:36:48,825
Look at the airs she's giving herself.

595
00:36:48,825 --> 00:36:50,578
We were the same palace maids once

596
00:36:50,578 --> 00:36:53,993
she sings one song, and suddenly she's a mistress

597
00:36:53,993 --> 00:36:55,178
and us?

598
00:36:55,178 --> 00:36:57,588
we have to endure bullying and mocking just to

599
00:36:57,588 --> 00:36:58,891
receive our monthly salary that is rightfully ours

600
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:02,241
We are all people but have different destinies. On that note,

601
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:04,089
Yu isn't even as pretty as you are, sister Huanbi.

602
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:04,922
Don't talk nonsense

603
00:37:29,703 --> 00:37:32,719
Xiao Xia Zi, come here

604
00:37:36,794 --> 00:37:38,110
young mistress, what can I do for you?

605
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:41,801
Since you're not doing anything, crack these walnut for me

606
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,308
Yes

607
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:49,590
Use your bare hands

608
00:37:52,435 --> 00:37:54,618
In response to young mistress, the walnut's shell is too hard

609
00:37:54,618 --> 00:37:57,516
I'm afraid even if I destroy my hands, I still cannot crack it

610
00:37:57,516 --> 00:37:58,873
Are you being lazy?

611
00:38:00,117 --> 00:38:03,480
Aren't you always the most loyal to His Majesty?

612
00:38:04,522 --> 00:38:06,321
If the Emperor wants to eat walnuts

613
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,278
So what if you ruin your hands?

614
00:38:48,215 --> 00:38:50,746
Xiao Xia Zi, what time is it?

615
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:53,790
It's 1:30 p.m, Your Majesty.

616
00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:58,483
Fool! Why didn't you wake me?

617
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:03,059
But, Your Majesty, you normally always sleep until this hour

618
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:04,191
Slap yourself

619
00:39:07,768 --> 00:39:09,491
Clothes, clothes

620
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,347
Your Majesty

621
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:22,154
You really are a fool

622
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:24,203
you had been so focused on cracking walnut for His Majesty to enjoy

623
00:39:24,203 --> 00:39:26,578
you forgot the time His Majesty needs to gets up

624
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,488
look at all the blood on your hands!

625
00:39:28,488 --> 00:39:29,806
how can you do your job later?

626
00:39:29,806 --> 00:39:32,018
Alright alright, forget the walnuts, take your leave.

627
00:39:32,592 --> 00:39:33,374
Yes

628
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:35,326
Go, go, go

629
00:39:36,062 --> 00:39:37,175
I'll take a walk

630
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,816
Your Majesty, it's raining outside

631
00:39:39,816 --> 00:39:41,164
If it's not, then what would be the purpose of the term "appreciating the rain"?

632
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:44,025
You! Go back to your place.

633
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:47,532
Your Majesty

634
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:48,844
Stop

635
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:53,662
Your Majesty,

636
00:39:54,942 --> 00:39:58,198
Empress Dowager ask you to go to Palace of Health.

637
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,063
<i>Thank you for watching! 
<i>Please join us!

638
00:40:07,063 --> 00:40:21,603
