<i> ~ Episode 7 ~</i>

3
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:05,697
He didn't come.

4
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:11,023
Are you talking about Duke Guo?

5
00:00:12,562 --> 00:00:13,601
it's my fault, I'm stupid.

6
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:16,836
He is a respectable Duke

7
00:00:18,077 --> 00:00:20,738
In this heavy rain he's not at home appreciate the rain, reading poems

8
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:22,559
why he has to come here for nothing?

9
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:25,726
That day may be he was just joking

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,467
yet I thought it was true

11
00:00:29,388 --> 00:00:32,509
May be he truly asked you to come

12
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:34,470
Only because the weather

13
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,174
makes it inconvenient to enter the palace

14
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:41,260
shao zhu 
 let's go back

15
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:44,641
Don't get wet

16
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:46,172
let's go

17
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:53,631
Is the Inner Palace still in harmony?

18
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:54,841
Everything is fine

19
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:56,222
That's good

20
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,964
I'm old now 
 I cannot take care of that much anymore

21
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:03,187
The Emperor has to take care of the country

22
00:01:03,187 --> 00:01:05,646
The Inner Palace you Empress have to look over.

23
00:01:05,646 --> 00:01:08,876
You need to pay attention to everything.

24
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:10,292
Yes, Empress Dowager.

25
00:01:22,964 --> 00:01:25,736
Your Majesty, just now this servant come here to see

26
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:27,327
Really there was nobody

27
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:33,308
This rain is so heavy, not coming is also understandable

28
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:34,971
Your Majesty

29
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:37,421
Nobody is as important as your health

30
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,837
It's stormy, please hurry back

31
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:43,884
Your Majesty, these days you work till late

32
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:45,140
you're coughing now

33
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,323
If you also get a cold

34
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:47,999
then it's my crime, your Highness

35
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,904
Your Highness, please come back

36
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,397
Over the high mount, a little moon comes out

37
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:05,110
Small as it is, how come the moon is so bright

38
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:09,115
My love is at a far-away place

39
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:15,739
One day no see, my heart is not at peace

40
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:19,383
What are you playing?

41
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:22,563
Nothing

42
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:28,955
The sound of music reveals a person's feeling

43
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:33,684
Xiao zhu's heart is missing something, cannot put it down

44
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,294
He is a Duke; you're a Lingering

45
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:44,577
Please forgive my garrulousness.

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,948
but you shouldn't have gone out today.

47
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:50,160
I know

48
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,669
I'm just a quiet, no-favor Lingering

49
00:02:55,746 --> 00:02:58,001
I don't even know how the Emperor look

50
00:02:59,582 --> 00:03:00,702
Nonetheless

51
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:03,720
I cannot have any relationship with the Duke

52
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:06,923
As Xiao zhu enters the palace, you belong to the Emperor

53
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:09,666
and that person is the Emperor's younger brother

54
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,321
If there were any rumors,

55
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:13,672
nothing would happen to him.

56
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:16,519
You would be the only one enduring the pain.

57
00:03:18,425 --> 00:03:19,305
I know

58
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:24,087
Jiejie

59
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:27,193
The rain just stops and you've already visit me

60
00:03:27,193 --> 00:03:28,414
Are you not scare of the slippery road?

61
00:03:30,187 --> 00:03:32,804
The Emperor is sick. I don't need to stand by him

62
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:35,705
If I don't come to see you, I would be so bored.

63
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:37,287
Mei jiejie takes care of the Emperor's sickness

64
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:39,900
She has to see Hua Fei again

65
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,908
she's going to endure a lot

66
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:43,064
Please have some tea

67
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:44,563
Ok.

68
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:49,159
His Majesty's sickness is also strange

69
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,652
How did he get a cold so unexpectedly?

70
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:54,792
There is also time when your body is not at its best

71
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:01,295
Your Majesty, the medicine is ready

72
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:03,212
Bring it to me

73
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:09,438
It's better to have me serve you

74
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:21,381
You stayed up all night yesterday

75
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,817
Go back early to rest

76
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,828
I'm used to serving you

77
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:28,738
I don't liking giving this job to others, I don't trust.

78
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:33,200
Mei Zhuang always does everthing thoroughly.

79
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,409
Even if it is so

80
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,330
Precious Shen is still a new person beside you

81
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:42,215
It's sometimes hard to avoid being lacking

82
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:49,900
Xiao zhu, Caiyue is here

83
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:51,792
Greeting Huan Lingering

84
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,831
Our Precious says

85
00:04:52,831 --> 00:04:54,887
The Internal Affairs Authority just has some new fabric for the spring

86
00:04:54,887 --> 00:04:56,161
please have Xiao zhu come over and choose

87
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:58,174
Why does your Xiao zhu have so much free time today?

88
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,193
Doesn't she say the Emperor is not well

89
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:01,151
and she has to take care of him?

90
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:02,890
His Majesty has recovered?

91
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:04,007
That's true

92
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:04,943
From last night

93
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:06,397
Our Xiao zhu doesn't have to stay by his side anymore

94
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:10,116
Brilliant spring sunshine

95
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:11,811
I let it (the beautiful weather) down

96
00:05:12,935 --> 00:05:14,723
Because your Majesty loves the beauty of spring

97
00:05:14,723 --> 00:05:16,889
you gets the cold at the Royal Garden

98
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:22,093
Hearing the Empress Dowager talking about the flowers at the Royal Garden

99
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:24,970
Originally wanted to fulfill my filial piety

100
00:05:26,585 --> 00:05:31,092
I went to the Royal Garden to select some pretty flowers for the Empress Dowager

101
00:05:32,336 --> 00:05:36,770
Didn't expect the chilly spring breeze would give me a cold.

102
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,671
Those who know the story will think your Majesty is filial

103
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:41,116
Those who don't know

104
00:05:41,116 --> 00:05:43,517
will even think the flowers in the Royal Garden all become demons

105
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,152
seducing you

106
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,866
Saying those words means you're narrow

107
00:05:48,656 --> 00:05:51,035
You don't read much, only good at arguing

108
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:55,287
Alright, you must have been tired all these days.

109
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:56,931
Go back early to rest

110
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:58,330
Yes

111
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,239
Your Majesty just finished meeting the officers

112
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,873
I already ordered the servants to brew the medicine

113
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:04,013
You should take the medicine before reading the officers' reports

114
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:17,176
Su Pei Sheng

115
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:19,701
I'm here

116
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:20,794
Follow me for a walk

117
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:22,439
Yes

118
00:06:24,227 --> 00:06:26,303
First help get change to casual clothes

119
00:06:26,863 --> 00:06:27,702
Yes

120
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,870
Here again.

121
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,255
Who is sitting on the swing?

122
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:44,170
Seeing my Xiao zhu, are you still not coming here?

123
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:47,877
Still not coming? I'm talking to you

124
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:51,600
My Xiao zhu is Huan Lingering at the Palace of Shattered Jade

125
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:54,923
Is there any Lingering that dress so simply?

126
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:00,526
Is there a Huan Lingering in the Inner Palace?

127
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:02,350
Why haven't I heard about her?

128
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,170
Xiao zhu, there is really a Huan Lingering at the Palace of Shattered Jade.

129
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,261
Because of her illness, she rarely comes out

130
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:14,949
Promise Yu shi greeting Huan Lingering

131
00:07:15,372 --> 00:07:16,511
Good morning, Promise Yu

132
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,566
Are you in the mood of taking a walk?

133
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:22,207
I have to serve the Emperor

134
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:24,687
don't have as much free time as Lingering Huan does

135
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:28,613
However, I have some words to advice Lingering Huan

136
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:32,229
If you're sick, you shouldn't come out

137
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:36,587
You should avoid spreading bad fortune to others and getting the blamed for it.

138
00:07:37,262 --> 00:07:38,639
Thank you for your advice

139
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:42,030
I however also have something to tell you

140
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,935
Not sure if Lingering Huan have any brilliant words for me?

141
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:49,880
I hear that the Emperor always like people that are refined and courteous

142
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:52,260
Yet when Promising Yu saw me

143
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:54,325
you didn't perform formal greeting to me

144
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:57,544
Maybe it's because you aren't familiar with the rules in the palace

145
00:07:58,764 --> 00:08:00,170
Let's do it like this

146
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,551
I'll have my maid do the greeting first

147
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:03,814
for you to learn

148
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:05,381
Yes

149
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:08,449
Promising, please have a look

150
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,477
Promising Yu shi greeting Lingering Huan

151
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:14,377
Wish Lingering Huan happiness and peace

152
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:17,410
I normally hear sisters in the palace praise Promising Yu's intelligence

153
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,774
can learn with one look

154
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:20,425
Then, Promising

155
00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:22,063
please follow Liuzhu's model

156
00:08:22,063 --> 00:08:23,701
and do the greeting one more time

157
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,116
You at most are a no-favor Lingering

158
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,972
Now you want me, a Xiao zhu,

159
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:31,126
to formally greet you?

160
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:31,712
Do you deserve that?

161
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,351
Xiao zhu, Lingering Huan's status

162
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:37,027
is really above yours, Xiao zhu

163
00:08:37,713 --> 00:08:39,483
You're a servant that eat the apple tree and protect the pear tree

164
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,714
Do you really think that

165
00:08:44,714 --> 00:08:47,547
role order truly follows status?

166
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,494
Whoever the Emperor favors has a higer status.

167
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,270
Otherwise, even if her status is high,

168
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,395
she is still a lowly woman

169
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:59,517
Furthermore, your status

170
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:02,697
is only higher than mine by just a little bit.

171
00:09:02,697 --> 00:09:04,496
You base on what to order me around?

172
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:07,738
If it's me who orders

173
00:09:07,738 --> 00:09:12,413
you to do formal greeting to Lingering Huan, then what will you do?

174
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:14,567
Greeting your Majesty

175
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:22,022
Your Majesty, why are you here?

176
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,077
Then why are you here?

177
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:28,630
I hear that your Majesty recently like to visit the Royal garden

178
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,721
thinking that the view must be charming

179
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:32,946
so I also take a walk here

180
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:34,814
These aren't honest words

181
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,613
I only wish to always be by your Majesty's side

182
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:43,372
How can you know where I'm going to so well?

183
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,414
Xiao zhu, xiao zhu

184
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:56,561
Greeting your Majesty

185
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:57,800
Wish you happiness and peace

186
00:09:57,948 --> 00:09:59,329
Wish you happiness and peace

187
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:01,074
I

188
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:04,617
that day didn't intentionally broke my promise and came late

189
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:08,507
These days although I was sick

190
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,539
I still missed you

191
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:13,662
Did you come here again to wait for me?

192
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:19,122
Raise

193
00:10:19,738 --> 00:10:22,092
Help you Xiao zhu. Her body is weak

194
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:23,877
Xiao zhu

195
00:10:25,982 --> 00:10:28,137
Your bad habit hasn't changed

196
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:31,318
Look like last time the Empress Dowager punished you too lightly

197
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:34,295
Your Majesty, I know my fault

198
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:36,659
Today I was ignorant

199
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:38,522
so I offended Lingering Huan

200
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:41,715
Then...then I will apologize to Lingering Huan

201
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:44,151
Your Majesty please forgive me this time

202
00:10:50,391 --> 00:10:52,346
I'm little sister today commit a horrible mistake

203
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:54,790
don't dare to ask for your forgiveness

204
00:10:55,094 --> 00:10:59,065
only ask Lingering to think about the fact that we both serve the Emperor

205
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:00,712
please ask his Majesty to spare my life

206
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:09,612
Your Majesty, knowing the mistake and fixing it, nothing is better

207
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:13,414
I think Promising Yu truly know her fault

208
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:15,775
Your Majesty please forgive her

209
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:19,558
Since Lingering Huan has already spoken for you

210
00:11:20,474 --> 00:11:22,745
then I cannot let her down

211
00:11:24,882 --> 00:11:27,303
But you never reflect your fault, it's really annoying

212
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:29,353
Su Pei Sheng

213
00:11:31,964 --> 00:11:33,726
I'm here

214
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,502
Remember, demote Yu shi to Servant Lady

215
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,672
pack her things out of the Palace of Essence

216
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:41,358
send her to where I cannot see her

217
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:44,103
Your Majesty

218
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,488
Didn't you say

219
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:48,194
The status of Lingering Huan is only higher than that of you just a little?

220
00:11:49,197 --> 00:11:52,795
I now promote Lingering to Precious

221
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,508
Your Majesty, promoting Lingering Huan without having her be with you first

222
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,448
I'm afraid it's against the rule

223
00:11:58,448 --> 00:12:00,864
You're doing more and more good things now

224
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:02,874
even dare to question my order

225
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:04,473
Your servant don't dare to

226
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:06,290
I'll go inform your order immediately

227
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:10,268
Are you so happy

228
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:11,752
that you've forgotten to thank me?

229
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:17,430
Firstly, I have made no contribution to the nation

230
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:19,220
Secondly, I am not of royal blood

231
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:22,518
Truly...don't dare to receive such a great honor from your Majesty

232
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:26,058
If I say you can, then you can.

233
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:28,579
Raise. Kneeling every now and then

234
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:30,545
don't even think for your body

235
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:37,152
Mistress Yu, please go back

236
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:45,211
I'll take my leave

237
00:13:03,962 --> 00:13:05,464
What now? Scared?

238
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,504
Your palm is all wet. Are you scared?

239
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,099
You're the Emperor

240
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:41,720
Before you weren't scared, you had a guts

241
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:46,930
Before I didn't know you're the Emperor, but now I know.

242
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,776
Your Majesty's magnificence echoes everywhere

243
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:53,187
I'm just an insignificant woman; I'm unable to not feel fearful

244
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:55,518
Fear will cause restrain feeling

245
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,508
Feeling restrain will turn the relationship into that of the king and officer

246
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:02,863
That day there was a storm. I didn't intentionally miss our meeting

247
00:14:03,694 --> 00:14:06,115
In only a few more steps I would reach the Royal garden

248
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:10,833
But the Empress Dowager called for me to the Palace of Health

249
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:13,833
When I came back to the Royal garden

250
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,540
beauty was no longer here

251
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,479
and I got a cold for many days

252
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:20,558
Is your health getting better?

253
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,078
Am I not soundingly standing here

254
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:26,232
talking to you?

255
00:14:27,137 --> 00:14:28,308
I'm senseless

256
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:29,971
Caring causes confusion

257
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:35,008
Then I thought back. That day it was raining heavily

258
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,036
You were still in recovery

259
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:39,743
You might cannot come

260
00:14:41,286 --> 00:14:44,867
Truthfully, that day I also kept my promise

261
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:46,211
Really?

262
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,703
Then you were in the rain. Did you get sick?

263
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:51,495
Thank you for your caring

264
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:55,884
I'm also soundingly standing here talking to you

265
00:14:57,598 --> 00:14:58,885
That's good then

266
00:14:59,994 --> 00:15:02,782
I only think that you just entered the palace and have already got sick

267
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:04,228
your health must be weaker than normal

268
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:09,439
Your Majesty, why did you lie to me?

269
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:10,750
It's not lying

270
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,267
I just don't want that

271
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:16,896
don't want you because of the status, fear of me

272
00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:20,421
obey me, flatter me

273
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,541
Even more, I don't want to become a lonely person because of my status

274
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,946
without even a confidante

275
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:30,202
I and your Majesty haven't known much about each other

276
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:32,663
I dare not be your confidante

277
00:15:34,384 --> 00:15:37,515
I like you becauce of your true nature

278
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:40,217
If you were like other people

279
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:44,008
I wouldn't have treasured the promise with you so highly

280
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:48,116
I'm foolish

281
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:49,659
I couldn't see anything

282
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:53,759
I purposely hid it from you. How could you know?

283
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,047
Only hard for 17th brother

284
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:59,329
The many times I had to call him into the palace and jail him here.

285
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:04,487
Your Majesty's heart is deep and thoughtful. How can I know?

286
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,147
Why is your hand so cold?

287
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:15,647
Is it because of the wind?

288
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:17,954
I'm not cold

289
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:20,166
You've been here for a long time

290
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,460
Let me take you back

291
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:24,284
Walking is tiring.

292
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,423
I'll carry you

293
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:26,886
I don't dare to

294
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,968
Why not?

295
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,850
Others will talk behind you

296
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:38,335
I care for the woman I like

297
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:42,229
If people want to gossip, let them

298
00:17:23,302 --> 00:17:26,587
Greeting the Emperor. Greeting Precious Huan

299
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,902
You guys get the news quite quickly

300
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:29,903
Your Majesty endowing Xiao zhu

301
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:31,676
is endowing everyone in the Palace of Shattered Jade

302
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,345
We sevants all gladly receive your Majesty's generousity

303
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:34,692
Raise

304
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:36,420
Thank you your Majesty

305
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,628
You're very good at speaking also. What's your name?

306
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:40,992
I'm Liuzhu, servant from home of Xiao zhu

307
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:45,077
Really like mistress like servant

308
00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:48,613
Thank you for your praising

309
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:04,005
My hands are tired

310
00:18:05,444 --> 00:18:07,639
Are your Majesty saying I'm heavy?

311
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:10,519
You're not heavy

312
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:12,412
It's because I'm afraid if I hold you too tightly, you'll be hurt

313
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:15,370
but if I hold you too loosely, you'll fall

314
00:18:16,052 --> 00:18:18,566
Two hands struggle don't know which way to go

315
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:19,490
therefore they get tired

316
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,177
Your Majesty are used to making fun of others

317
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,112
When Precious Huan was a Lingering

318
00:18:29,112 --> 00:18:30,810
Were there only you guys who serve her?

319
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,816
Yes

320
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:33,721
I need quiet time for recovery

321
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:36,834
so I don't need so many servants

322
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:38,606
That's not Ok

323
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:43,875
Who are the maid and eunuch managers here?

324
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:45,386
Responding to your Majesty

325
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:48,456
I'm Jin Xi, the manager of the maids here

326
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:51,495
There's no manager of eunuches at the Palace of Shattered Jade

327
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:53,815
The old manager of eunuches

328
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:54,690
Two months ago

329
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,607
was called to worked for Li Pin

330
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:00,039
This is not a problem

331
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:04,687
It's not all right to not have a eunuch manager at your place

332
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:07,904
Tomorrow I'll order the Internal Affairs Authority to select some experienced servants

333
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:10,693
You choose one to be your manager of eunuches

334
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,094
I gladly receive your Majesty's caring

335
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:17,823
Actually there's no need to cause too many troubles

336
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:20,543
I think Xiao Yun Zi is very good

337
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:24,286
How about promoting him to this role, then training him latter?

338
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:26,904
Thank you your Majesty! Thank you Xiao zhu!

339
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:29,601
I'll definitely do by best to serve Xiao zhu

340
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:33,418
Ok. You say he's good then he's good

341
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,145
Avoid having outsiders

342
00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:37,393
who don't know your style

343
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:42,534
Your Xiao zhu thinks highly of you

344
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:43,770
you must work even harder

345
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,258
Yes. I'll obey your order

346
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,515
You're promoted to be Precious

347
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:50,749
now you need more servants

348
00:19:51,376 --> 00:19:54,080
Tomorrow I'll order the Internal Affairs Authority to select some good servants

349
00:19:55,331 --> 00:19:56,019
Thank you your Majesty

350
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:00,182
Your Majesty

351
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:02,600
Zhang Ting Yu wants to see you

352
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:04,455
I know.

353
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:13,834
Rest well.

354
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,405
I will come back to see you in a few days

355
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,330
I send Your Majesty off

356
00:20:30,971 --> 00:20:32,241
You know my rules

357
00:20:33,138 --> 00:20:35,239
I know that when practicing your writing,

358
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:36,522
Niang Niang doesn't like to be disturbed.

359
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:37,784
But...

360
00:20:37,784 --> 00:20:40,772
Promise Yu has been punished. She has been demoted to servant lady.

361
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,315
His Majesty's intention?

362
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:44,302
Yes, exactly.

363
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:47,372
This matter was sorted out faster than I expected.

364
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:49,855
Have someone watch her. Don't allow her to make a fuss.

365
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:50,710
Yes

366
00:20:51,224 --> 00:20:53,809
Yushi is frivolous. She wasn't fit to serve His Majesty.

367
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:56,886
and she does not know caution.

368
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:57,894
How was she incautious?

369
00:20:58,515 --> 00:20:59,910
She overstepped her bounds

370
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,403
and insulted "Precious Smile"

371
00:21:04,198 --> 00:21:05,544
Has she been promoted to Precious already?

372
00:21:06,413 --> 00:21:08,304
His Majesty must like her?

373
00:21:08,764 --> 00:21:09,936
It seems so

374
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:12,321
But it is against the Palace rules to skip a rank.

375
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:14,035
you should talk to His Majesty.

376
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:16,067
Palace rules were set by the ancestors

377
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,033
Ancestors are Sons of Heaven.

378
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:19,422
The Emperer is also the Son of Heaven.

379
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,065
She is not ordinary; it was going to happen sooner or later

380
00:21:27,072 --> 00:21:28,385
Lu Gong Gong, go well

381
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:29,635
Many thanks Gong Gong

382
00:21:39,522 --> 00:21:41,021
Greetings Precious Wan

383
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:42,226
The moment he returned to his study,

384
00:21:42,226 --> 00:21:44,236
His Majesty instructed me to bring you some things.

385
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:46,251
Thank you for your trouble, Gong Gong

386
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:48,601
It is servant's honor to serve Precious

387
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:50,126
Precious, please look

388
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:52,220
This is silk lace

389
00:21:53,182 --> 00:21:54,466
A pair of 'Jing Tai Lan' bangles

390
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:56,648
A box of orchid head ornaments inlaid with gold and precious stones.

391
00:21:57,433 --> 00:22:00,069
Two boxes of wishful headdress flowers <br />A wishful beads curtain

392
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:02,608
Sixteen bolts of silk

393
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,701
The last item, His Majesty specially instructed

394
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:07,353
that Precious must personally take a look.

395
00:22:18,594 --> 00:22:19,672
Many thanks to His Majesty

396
00:22:20,003 --> 00:22:22,407
His Majesty explains that young mistress has been tending to her illness all this time,

397
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,432
she must feel lonely.

398
00:22:23,432 --> 00:22:26,294
so he is giving this to you in hope that you will smile

399
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,919
I cannot personally thank him because of my illness

400
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,805
Gong Gong, please thank His Majesty on my behalf

401
00:22:31,528 --> 00:22:32,717
Young Mistress is too polite

402
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:34,909
His majesty knows that young mistress has not fully recuperated yet

403
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:37,078
Too many visitors will impair young mistress's recovery

404
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,079
Except his majesty and the imperial doctor, no one else is allowed entry

405
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:42,398
He asks that Cui Gugu take care of this

406
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,164
Yes, his majesty is considerate and thorough

407
00:22:45,748 --> 00:22:47,436
Then I take my leave

408
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:54,190
This afternoon

409
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,190
all the gifts we received will not fit in the storage room.

410
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:56,837
Exactly

411
00:22:56,837 --> 00:22:58,408
- Huan Meimei
- Jiejie

412
00:22:58,408 --> 00:22:59,865
Finally, you can stand out above the others

413
00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:03,320
I pay my respects to Precious Wan

414
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,565
What are you doing?

415
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:05,777
Are us sisters going to be picky about statuses now?

416
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:08,016
Mei Jiejie was crazy with joy

417
00:23:08,016 --> 00:23:09,199
She dragged me here as soon as she heard the news

418
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:11,748
But I still have to follow the rules and be alert

419
00:23:11,748 --> 00:23:14,646
We can't go so far as to have everyone drunk with happiness

420
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:16,408
Linrong is right

421
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:17,790
Let's go inside quickly to talk

422
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,081
Let's go

423
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,263
You all keep watch outside

424
00:23:23,263 --> 00:23:24,630
No need to serve us inside

425
00:23:24,982 --> 00:23:25,943
Yes

426
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,832
How did Jiejie become Precious Wan so silently?

427
00:23:29,832 --> 00:23:31,186
You hid it the secret so well,

428
00:23:31,186 --> 00:23:33,322
not the slightest news was revealed.

429
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:35,302
I really didn't mean to hide it

430
00:23:35,302 --> 00:23:38,562
I met the Emperor by chance in the imperial garden

431
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:41,830
There is a saying "the quiet amazes with a single feat"

432
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,289
That is you.

433
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,545
I was sitting in my palace

434
00:23:45,545 --> 00:23:46,581
When I first heard of this,

435
00:23:46,581 --> 00:23:47,889
I thought it was an unfounded rumor!

436
00:23:48,703 --> 00:23:51,343
When his majesty's Su Gong Gong passed down the decree,

437
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:52,573
we finally believed it.

438
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:54,241
Then we immediately came over to congratulate Jiejie

439
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,060
Only...how many pairs of eyes will be focused on you from now on?

440
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,800
You must be careful

441
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,676
I know

442
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,609
The Emperor values Older Sister

443
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,810
and promoted you even though you haven't served him.

444
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,081
With his majesty's favor,

445
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:08,989
Jiejie need not be afraid.

446
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,262
I got promoted without serving him

447
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:14,749
It's not good that his majesty favors me too much.

448
00:24:15,302 --> 00:24:16,756
You hold his favour now

449
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,616
They wouldn't dare do anything to you

450
00:24:19,553 --> 00:24:21,905
We heard that because Yushi humiliated Jiejie,

451
00:24:21,905 --> 00:24:23,181
she was reprimanded by his majesty.

452
00:24:24,156 --> 00:24:25,541
With her as an example,

453
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,697
no one would dare provoke Jiejie anymore.

454
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,767
Promise Yu was at fault

455
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,491
But I'm worried that one day,

456
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:33,967
I will also inadvertently cause trouble like Promise Yu.

457
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:36,357
Would my family be implicated?

458
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:40,466
Now that you are officially favored by his majesty, you have no other road to take

459
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,877
At least His Majesty protects you

460
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:45,986
It's better than having no one.

461
00:24:46,906 --> 00:24:48,006
Jiejie don't worry

462
00:24:49,065 --> 00:24:51,291
The most important thing now is to nurture your health

463
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,068
so that you can become a true Precious.

464
00:24:53,738 --> 00:24:55,137
Lingrong is right

465
00:24:55,137 --> 00:24:56,604
As long as our sisters' hearts are linked,

466
00:24:56,604 --> 00:24:59,137
we will definitely survive in the palace.

467
00:25:10,768 --> 00:25:11,774
What kind of place is this?

468
00:25:11,774 --> 00:25:12,917
Why didn't anyone tidy it up?

469
00:25:14,353 --> 00:25:15,480
Young mistress

470
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,537
You can't stay in the Palace of Essence anymore

471
00:25:18,537 --> 00:25:20,097
If his majesty hadn't considered your past affections,

472
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:22,540
I think you should be sent to the Cold Palace.

473
00:25:23,157 --> 00:25:25,344
You wouldn't have your own room

474
00:25:25,344 --> 00:25:26,838
or be able to keep a servant lady to serve you.

475
00:25:27,511 --> 00:25:29,311
You should not complain about this.

476
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:31,464
Just settle in.

477
00:25:34,762 --> 00:25:38,470
Gong Gong, please take the trouble to let me see the emperor once

478
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,389
The emperor will definitely forgive me

479
00:25:41,234 --> 00:25:42,160
Young mistress overestimates me

480
00:25:43,263 --> 00:25:45,792
We are all instructed by Xia Gong Gong

481
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,302
Young mistress, don't you look down on eunuchs the most?

482
00:25:49,302 --> 00:25:51,189
We're not fit to serve you

483
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,483
Young mistress, don't be upset

484
00:26:06,057 --> 00:26:08,268
How dare you

485
00:26:08,268 --> 00:26:10,819
How dare you

486
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:24,548
Greetings, Princess of Glory.

487
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:26,450
Servant came over today

488
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,450
to deliver the monthly salary for Palace of Wings.

489
00:26:31,836 --> 00:26:34,343
It seems heavier than usual

490
00:26:35,215 --> 00:26:36,928
It is as it should be

491
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,749
Everyone, high and low, in the Internal Affairs Authority relies on Niang Niang's care

492
00:26:39,749 --> 00:26:41,799
We should honor you with more filial respect

493
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:44,045
You are quite filial. Get up.

494
00:26:44,908 --> 00:26:45,745
Thanks Niang Niang

495
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,629
Lately his majesty has conferred another Precious title

496
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:51,173
I'm afraid your Internal Affairs Authority will be busier,

497
00:26:51,173 --> 00:26:52,445
with everyone getting ready.

498
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,557
Many thanks for Niang Niang's concern. We're not busy.

499
00:26:54,557 --> 00:26:57,140
At most, they're only errands for a Precious

500
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,034
Not too much work

501
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,255
That Precious Smile has always remained in obscurity

502
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:05,602
She must have taken a lot of abuse from your Internal Affairs Authority

503
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:08,764
She's in favor now

504
00:27:08,764 --> 00:27:10,423
so you have making up to do

505
00:27:10,423 --> 00:27:12,164
Good luck with that

506
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:15,055
If his majesty hears anything from her,

507
00:27:15,693 --> 00:27:17,576
even I won't be able to help you.

508
00:27:19,645 --> 00:27:21,825
Niang niang please take care of me

509
00:27:23,771 --> 00:27:25,753
How can I take care of you?

510
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:28,939
You're in charge of tasks for the Internal Affairs Authority

511
00:27:29,862 --> 00:27:32,207
Carefully select people to serve her

512
00:27:38,946 --> 00:27:41,445
Young mistress, Princess of Glory sent over these snacks

513
00:27:41,445 --> 00:27:42,328
Young mistress, have a taste

514
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,598
It is said that pastries from Princess of Glory's palace

515
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,139
are better than the Royal Kitchen.

516
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:49,484
And she doesn't give it away easily.

517
00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:53,248
You may leave.

518
00:27:53,248 --> 00:27:54,270
yes.

519
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,042
These pastries

520
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:07,789
is indeed better than the Royal Kitchen's.

521
00:28:08,475 --> 00:28:09,684
Mistress should try it.

522
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,240
Seeing these pastries

523
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,626
reminds me of the punishment

524
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:18,696
which crippled Xia Dong Chun

525
00:28:20,056 --> 00:28:23,024
Jing Xi, I'm so scared.

526
00:28:24,265 --> 00:28:26,088
Things can change in an instant here.

527
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,908
Being afraid will not solve anything.

528
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:32,693
But one thing remains the same.

529
00:28:33,231 --> 00:28:35,609
The word "favor" is still the most important thing.

530
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,801
Too much favour will raise the ire of others.

531
00:28:39,404 --> 00:28:40,579
Too little favour

532
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:43,382
will give others permission to step on you.

533
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:46,607
Mistress should understand,

534
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:47,734
regardless of whether you are in favour or not

535
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:49,675
you are never free

536
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:52,016
from the power struggles within the Inner Palace.

537
00:28:52,016 --> 00:28:55,752
For example, Mistress, Precious Shen,

538
00:28:55,752 --> 00:28:57,143
and Promise An are good sisters.

539
00:28:57,143 --> 00:28:59,826
Others will see this as forming a front

540
00:29:00,147 --> 00:29:01,780
I grew up with Older Sister

541
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,942
Naturally we look out for each other.

542
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:07,221
Mistress is close with Precious Shen.

543
00:29:07,221 --> 00:29:08,185
This is good.

544
00:29:08,924 --> 00:29:12,310
But taking care of each other

545
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,311
is not restricted to just the Inner Palace.

546
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:16,588
It is also between the Inner Palace and Outer Ministers.

547
00:29:17,637 --> 00:29:19,666
Princess of Glory is a good example.

548
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:23,016
Favour and family background

549
00:29:23,016 --> 00:29:25,207
are closely linked.

550
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,082
I just want my family to be safe.

551
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:31,978
I just want the Emporer's sincerity.

552
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:35,356
It is best to think like that.

553
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:39,630
Since Mistress has been chosen to serve

554
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,956
you are already different to girls outside the Palace.

555
00:29:43,585 --> 00:29:46,886
You have little control over your life.

556
00:29:47,878 --> 00:29:49,203
But this servant can tell that

557
00:29:49,203 --> 00:29:51,295
the Emporer likes Mistress a lot.

558
00:29:51,837 --> 00:29:53,413
Mistress also likes the Emporer

559
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,278
That day I went to the Blossoms Garden

560
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:57,389
with 3 wishes.

561
00:29:57,389 --> 00:29:58,706
But I didnt get to

562
00:29:58,706 --> 00:30:00,059
make the last wish.

563
00:30:00,792 --> 00:30:02,048
This servant is listening.

564
00:30:03,464 --> 00:30:04,637
Third wish

565
00:30:04,925 --> 00:30:07,954
To find my one true love and grow old with him

566
00:30:10,094 --> 00:30:11,790
But my one true love

567
00:30:13,174 --> 00:30:15,914
is the one man who can never be wholly mine

568
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,863
Then wish for something else

569
00:30:17,863 --> 00:30:21,776
not for his whole heart, but for a sincere heart

570
00:30:39,556 --> 00:30:42,498
Young mistress's health has already improve considerably

571
00:30:46,536 --> 00:30:50,179
But servant can still plead with his majesty

572
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,228
that young mistress's health condition

573
00:30:52,228 --> 00:30:53,971
is still not suitable for serving his majesty.

574
00:30:54,805 --> 00:30:55,878
My illness

575
00:30:55,878 --> 00:30:58,282
has not fully recovered only because I continue to take medicine.

576
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:02,642
If his majesty sends other imperial doctors to treat me,

577
00:31:02,642 --> 00:31:03,734
will I be found out?

578
00:31:04,527 --> 00:31:06,541
If they find out, what will be the outcome?

579
00:31:11,396 --> 00:31:14,344
Last time, you and I had a choice whether to use medicine

580
00:31:14,344 --> 00:31:17,519
This time, to fully recover without leaving any traces,

581
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:20,276
you don't have a choice. Neither do I.

582
00:31:23,474 --> 00:31:26,016
Servant follows young mistress's orders

583
00:31:27,615 --> 00:31:29,005
Without Physician Wen in the back palace,

584
00:31:29,005 --> 00:31:30,434
Huan'er would be treading on thin ice.

585
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:33,298
Servant dares not stand out

586
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:35,052
I will thoroughly protect young mistress

587
00:31:35,252 --> 00:31:36,345
That's good

588
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:38,784
Then Physician Wen, please cure my illness

589
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:40,977
but not too quickly!

590
00:31:42,473 --> 00:31:44,469
One month would be ideal

591
00:31:45,213 --> 00:31:47,566
Then servant will gradually reduce the dosage

592
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:50,116
and in due time, add in some tonics.

593
00:31:51,228 --> 00:31:52,406
You will be fine

594
00:31:53,582 --> 00:31:55,025
Then I will have to trouble you

595
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:05,580
Imperial Physician Wen, go well

596
00:32:34,315 --> 00:32:36,790
Servant pays respects to young mistress

597
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,865
Reporting to young mistress, these servant ladies and eunuchs

598
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:44,199
were all carefully selected to serve young mistress.

599
00:32:45,116 --> 00:32:46,170
Gong Gong please rise

600
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:47,636
Thanks young mistress

601
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:50,466
People selected by Huang Gong Gong must be good

602
00:32:51,057 --> 00:32:52,611
Otherwise if I have any problems in the future,

603
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:54,544
I will come find you.

604
00:32:54,544 --> 00:32:55,955
Yes

605
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,457
Jin Xi

606
00:32:57,457 --> 00:32:58,045
Yes

607
00:32:58,045 --> 00:32:59,270
Instruct them well

608
00:33:01,129 --> 00:33:02,058
Everyone come with me

609
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,095
Servant is muddle-headed

610
00:33:05,095 --> 00:33:07,633
Because I was busy lately with some trifle matters in the Internal Affairs Authority,

611
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:10,350
the matter of painting young mistress's table and chairs...

612
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,890
I had Xiao Luzi handle.

613
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,024
Who knew this incompetent servant would be so careless

614
00:33:15,024 --> 00:33:16,180
and forgot it?

615
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,573
I specially brought him here today

616
00:33:18,573 --> 00:33:20,392
to apologize to young mistress,

617
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:21,373
for young mistress to deal with.

618
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,739
We don't dare accept Huang Gong Gong's apology

619
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:29,166
otherwise you will be talking behind our backs again

620
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:30,747
and make us all angry

621
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:32,756
Liuzhu, lose your manners again?

622
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,091
Look at what this miss is saying

623
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:37,673
It's all servant's fault for ineffectively instructing my subordinates

624
00:33:38,545 --> 00:33:39,630
Gong Gong's words are too strong

625
00:33:40,481 --> 00:33:43,392
Actually, there are thousands of things to attend to in the Internal Affairs Authority

626
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:45,001
all of varying importance

627
00:33:45,001 --> 00:33:47,305
It's only normal for your subordinates to slip up

628
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:49,155
What is there for you to apologise for?

629
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,895
Thank you for your understanding

630
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,922
From now on, we servants will definitely be more attentive

631
00:33:53,922 --> 00:33:55,148
in serving young mistress.

632
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,258
Right

633
00:33:56,258 --> 00:33:58,530
Servant had them bring a new table

634
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,512
I hope young mistress doesn't find it crude

635
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:03,342
Many thanks Gong Gong for still remembering

636
00:34:04,325 --> 00:34:06,687
Xiao Yunzi, take it

637
00:34:06,687 --> 00:34:07,514
Yes

638
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:09,766
If young mistress doesn't have any other orders,

639
00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:10,961
servant will take my leave.

640
00:34:11,946 --> 00:34:12,732
Gong Gong go slowly

641
00:34:12,732 --> 00:34:13,728
Thanks young mistress

642
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:15,803
Go!

643
00:34:19,747 --> 00:34:21,768
How could you speak so imprudently?

644
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,466
This...this Huang Gui Quan veers with the wind!

645
00:34:24,466 --> 00:34:26,136
Previously he deducted young mistress's expenses

646
00:34:26,136 --> 00:34:27,457
Now that young mistress is favored,

647
00:34:27,457 --> 00:34:29,621
he invariably turns to flattery and blames someone else!

648
00:34:29,911 --> 00:34:31,112
Just keep it to yourself

649
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,508
and know to stay vigilant.

650
00:34:32,508 --> 00:34:33,843
If you make a scene and news spreads,

651
00:34:33,843 --> 00:34:36,031
won't others say we are flaunting our newfound power?

652
00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:39,654
Then...servant won't dare anymore

653
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,476
I know you did it for my good

654
00:34:41,476 --> 00:34:43,143
but you shouldn't have acted out so emotionally in the moment.

655
00:34:44,281 --> 00:34:46,180
Everyone in the palace veers with the wind

656
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,061
not just Huang Gui Quan.

657
00:34:49,544 --> 00:34:50,895
I know I was wrong

658
00:34:54,484 --> 00:34:55,754
It wasn't bad to warn him.

659
00:34:56,549 --> 00:34:57,659
make him fear.

660
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,259
Tell every servant,

661
00:34:59,259 --> 00:35:00,332
don't make trouble

662
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,096
Mistress, Huang Gui Quan is a distant relative of Hua Princess

663
00:35:05,711 --> 00:35:07,226
I know,

664
00:35:07,226 --> 00:35:08,829
I'll tell Jin Xi and XIao Yun zi

665
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:10,995
make an all-out effort to watch out

666
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:14,049
I'm won't allow the servants that Huang sent here make any trouble.

667
00:35:14,783 --> 00:35:17,473
And, only let them do menial jobs.

668
00:35:17,473 --> 00:35:20,303
you still deal with my affairs

669
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,595
servant knows

670
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,999
Greetings Precious Smile

671
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,497
In the afternoon, his majesty will pay a visit to the Palace of Shattered Jade

672
00:35:28,497 --> 00:35:29,748
Young mistress, please quickly prepare

673
00:35:29,748 --> 00:35:31,046
Thanks Gong Gong

674
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,083
Then young mistress, quickly change and prepare

675
00:35:36,688 --> 00:35:37,983
His majesty is coming

676
00:35:37,983 --> 00:35:40,234
Young mistress, change into a more vivid outfit to greet him

677
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,190
I will just wear this. It's fine.

678
00:35:43,738 --> 00:35:46,731
It is fine, just a bit plain

679
00:35:47,764 --> 00:35:50,265
It's better to wear an everyday outfit like this

680
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:02,213
May Your Majesty have health and prosperity

681
00:36:07,018 --> 00:36:09,204
It's windy outside, quickly take me inside

682
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,669
Yes

683
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:17,462
Lotus flower appearing just above the water, being unaffectedly easy and natural<br />(the emperor is complimenting her on her natural beauty,and does not need to dress up)

684
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,917
My Precious Smile is indeed different from all the others

685
00:36:22,688 --> 00:36:26,336
Your Majesty does not look down on my plain dressing?

686
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:28,091
You dress without finery

687
00:36:28,091 --> 00:36:29,897
Your palace maids are dressed simply

688
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:32,368
It's very refreshing

689
00:36:33,008 --> 00:36:34,998
Huanbi is my intimate servant

690
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,761
Huanbi? No wonder she is wearing a jade-colored outfit

691
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:46,342
Huanbi

692
00:36:47,896 --> 00:36:49,388
His majesty might not like so many people around right now

693
00:36:49,388 --> 00:36:50,964
Let's wait here

694
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:53,019
That's fine too

695
00:36:54,275 --> 00:36:55,211
Huanbi Jiejie

696
00:36:55,211 --> 00:36:57,284
Other servant ladies also wear the same green-colored outfit,

697
00:36:57,284 --> 00:36:59,679
but only Huanbi Jiejie receives compliments from his majesty.

698
00:37:00,735 --> 00:37:02,618
I thought his majesty would notice Liuzhu first

699
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,593
Her pink outfit is more eye-catching

700
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:06,216
Liuzhu Jiejie is beautiful too

701
00:37:06,216 --> 00:37:07,676
Just not like Huanbi Jiejie,

702
00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:09,190
with brows and eyes similar to young mistress's.

703
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,196
That's why his majesty took extra notice

704
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:12,197
Really?

705
00:37:24,582 --> 00:37:27,144
Your majesty, have a cup of tea. I brewed it.

706
00:37:27,669 --> 00:37:29,570
I don't know if it is to your liking

707
00:37:31,887 --> 00:37:36,172
You personally prepared it. This expression I like the most.

708
00:37:48,223 --> 00:37:49,146
Fragrant tea

709
00:37:57,499 --> 00:38:01,332
This tea is especially light and pure, refreshingly fragrant

710
00:38:02,226 --> 00:38:05,301
By it's taste, it's cold tea from Yue Zhou

711
00:38:06,436 --> 00:38:08,922
You put in plum blossoms and pine needles

712
00:38:08,922 --> 00:38:09,824
What else?

713
00:38:11,262 --> 00:38:12,580
Your Majesty has exceptionally good taste buds

714
00:38:13,103 --> 00:38:15,410
This tea is called 'three friends of winter'

715
00:38:15,832 --> 00:38:18,768
It was brewed together with pine needles, bamboo leaves, and plum blossoms

716
00:38:19,578 --> 00:38:22,618
The water is dewdrops collected from lotus leaves during the summer sunrise

717
00:38:22,618 --> 00:38:24,415
which makes it so light and refreshing.

718
00:38:24,615 --> 00:38:27,406
The ancients said, tea can freshen the heart

719
00:38:28,251 --> 00:38:29,640
Having tasted your tea today,

720
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,107
I now know that the ancients' words are true.

721
00:38:32,107 --> 00:38:33,256
Your majesty praises too much

722
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:35,545
Coincidently,

723
00:38:35,545 --> 00:38:38,002
I received two jars of tea last year, and was reluctant to drink them.

724
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:39,806
I brought a jar into the palace

725
00:38:39,806 --> 00:38:41,543
and buried it underneath the pear tree behind the hall.

726
00:38:42,034 --> 00:38:43,354
I took it out just two days ago.

727
00:38:47,747 --> 00:38:49,777
Are you accustomed to living in this Palace of Shattered Jade?

728
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:51,923
I think it's a bit far

729
00:38:52,485 --> 00:38:53,923
Many thanks for your majesty's care

730
00:38:53,923 --> 00:38:57,063
I think it's alright, very peaceful

731
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:05,776
Palace of Shattered Jade is peaceful

732
00:39:06,202 --> 00:39:08,352
It's just a bit far from my Hall of Resting Soul

733
00:39:09,502 --> 00:39:11,951
But it doesn't matter since I want to come here.

734
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:14,682
It's enough that the heart is close

735
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:18,105
Yes, our hearts are close

736
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:23,085
I see that your complexion has improved much

737
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:25,097
You should fully recover soon

738
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:28,372
It was never a major illness

739
00:39:29,214 --> 00:39:31,107
My body is just of weak health

740
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:34,298
Now that I also have your majesty's good fortune and blessing,

741
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,270
of course I will recover more quickly.

742
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:54,019
Your bashfulness makes it hard for me to part with you
