3
00:00:10,873 --> 00:00:11,844
"Precious Smile"

4
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:15,466
Has Precious Wan's stick been made?

5
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:16,465
Just finished.

6
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:17,820
We can add it tonight.

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:19,960
The Emperor hasn't given the order.

8
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:22,567
Keep it for now.

9
00:00:26,043 --> 00:00:28,470
This Precious Wan is highly favoured.

10
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:32,565
Her stick will be flipped often in future.

11
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,546
Not wasting everynight's candlelight,

12
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:43,579
It's finally blossomed

13
00:00:44,913 --> 00:00:46,440
The Emporer visits often.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,990
He brings the Dragon aura, of course the flowers are blossoming.

15
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:53,603
Greetings to Precious Wan.

16
00:00:54,717 --> 00:00:56,014
Mistress, you're lucky,

17
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,769
The Emperor grants you a bath in Soup Spring Palace.

18
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:59,378
And asked Jin Xi Gugu to serve.

19
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:00,931
Thank the majesty.

20
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:03,662
Jin Xi Gugu, please make everything ready

21
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:06,049
Sedan chair will be waiting outside afternoon.

22
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:09,375
Yes, I'll make everything ready for young mistress.

23
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,743
Then, Servant will go.

24
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:13,068
There is still a lot to prepare for.

25
00:01:16,398 --> 00:01:17,740
Where is Soup Spring Palace?

26
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,096
Why use sedan chair?

27
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,311
Soup Spring Palace is a Royal pavilion of Chang Ping ( a place in Beijing )

28
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:23,588
His Majesty must think that the Royal Palace is too crowded

29
00:01:23,588 --> 00:01:25,566
and thus wants to bring young mistress out

30
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:31,049
My young mistress is physically weak, and hot spring is best for her.

31
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,865
Your Majesty,

32
00:01:34,865 --> 00:01:36,060
Has everything been prepared

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,540
When is the Emporer leaving?

34
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,042
At noon.

35
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:40,439
Su Pei Sheng just said

36
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,881
the Emporer has invited Precious Wan to the hot springs.

37
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,880
Jian Qiu. Tell the Emperor

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,938
I am feeling unwell today.

39
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:55,849
I cannot travel with His Majesty after all.

40
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,480
Yes.

41
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,856
Your Highness

42
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,649
Your Highness uses the Queen's spa

43
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:05,668
Precious Wan

44
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,139
will use the Concubines' spa.

45
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,183
She cannot disturb you.

46
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:11,550
The Emperor is in a good mood today.

47
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:14,007
I should let him be.

48
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:17,955
Your Highness is so virtuous.

49
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:21,087
If this were the Princess of Glory,

50
00:02:21,087 --> 00:02:24,451
who knows what she'll do out of jealousy.

51
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:13,213
Is Your Majesty trying to be Emperor Han.

52
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:18,601
I dare not be Zhao He De.

53
00:03:19,102 --> 00:03:20,486
Such impudence

54
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,422
You dare compare me with Emporer Han.

55
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:30,668
Your Majesty is sharp and wise.

56
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:31,904
Emperor Han is unable to compare.

57
00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:36,036
Even though it is blatant flattery.

58
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:37,553
I like hearing it.

59
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:41,878
But you live in the Inner Palace

60
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:44,901
how would you know if I'm wise in Court.

61
00:03:46,214 --> 00:03:47,965
Don't discuss matters of politics.

62
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,609
I don't know what happens in the Courts.

63
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:55,717
Except one thing.Your majesty

64
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:58,784
posess beauties more beautiful than Fei Yan, He De.

65
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:03,199
and more virtuous than Ban Jie Yu

66
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,481
Emperor Han is less fortunate than Your Majesty.

67
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:11,258
My Precious Wan posseses a ready tongue.

68
00:04:11,258 --> 00:04:14,264
You are above Fei Yan's empty beauty.

69
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:18,087
I am indeed more fortunate than Emporer Han.

70
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,738
Scared?

71
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:36,099
I'm not scared.

72
00:05:37,957 --> 00:05:39,942
No? You are not looking at me.

73
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:44,155
Girls are always scared during their first time.

74
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:47,312
I am not scared.

75
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:53,358
To Your Majesty I am just a normal girl.

76
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:59,028
But I see Your Majesty as my husband.

77
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:03,392
Tonight is my wedding night.

78
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:06,076
So I am nervous.

79
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,458
It's alright.

80
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:13,906
The servants by your side

81
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,708
shoud have already taught you.

82
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:18,688
I am fearful.

83
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:22,977
The servants taught me how to serve the Emperor.

84
00:06:24,078 --> 00:06:25,492
But they never taught me

85
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,007
how to serve my husband.

86
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:37,774
I am too bold. Please forgive me.

87
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:01,397
Usually the girls are terrified when they serve.

88
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:06,060
They are too cautious; even the Queen is no exception.

89
00:07:07,306 --> 00:07:09,748
No one has ever said anything like this to me.

90
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,492
Since you treat me as your husband

91
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:19,164
Don't be so so cautious in front of your husband.

92
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,066
Your Highness' back has been giving you pains.

93
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:59,431
You should rest after eating the medicine.

94
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:02,535
The Emperor is finally with her.

95
00:08:04,174 --> 00:08:06,621
Being with her now means nothing.

96
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:09,092
Jumping to the rank of "Precious",

97
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:12,004
visiting her every other day,

98
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,403
even taking her to the hot springs.

99
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:19,949
He only took her.

100
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:25,698
He's treating her like Concubine Yang.

101
00:08:26,354 --> 00:08:27,435
That Concubine Yang

102
00:08:27,435 --> 00:08:29,323
met a untimely end.

103
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:31,798
The Emperor is temporarily smitten.

104
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:33,811
Yu was also high in his favour.

105
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:36,012
Now she doesn't exist to him.

106
00:08:36,755 --> 00:08:38,151
Hopefully it is like that.

107
00:08:40,843 --> 00:08:45,953
But who can guess His Majesty's heart.

108
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,835
What are you doing?

109
00:09:46,174 --> 00:09:47,352
I've woken you up.

110
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:49,606
That candle is flickering.

111
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:55,770
The candle is giving light, I am happy.

112
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:03,784
Is there a story.

113
00:10:05,849 --> 00:10:07,710
I've heard that one tradition of marriage

114
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:10,967
is to light a pair of candles on the wedding night

115
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,608
and keep it bright til morning.

116
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:15,971
That way the new couple will be together

117
00:10:15,971 --> 00:10:17,482
forever.

118
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:20,149
But usually a Pheonix Candle is used.

119
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,946
This plain candle can be used in its place I guess.

120
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:25,946
I am over 40.

121
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:28,641
To ask you to grow old with me,

122
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:32,566
means I'll have to live to over 100.

123
00:10:34,538 --> 00:10:35,649
The Emperor lives ten thousand years.

124
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:38,866
If you only live til 100 because of me,

125
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:40,271
you'd be getting the short stick.

126
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,232
You know how to comfort me.

127
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:46,695
Your Majety is making fun of me.

128
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:48,868
Since I believe in the candle tradition.

129
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:53,472
I think you are cute and naive.

130
00:10:59,863 --> 00:11:01,146
In my life

131
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,673
I've only lit a Pheonix Candle once.

132
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:09,063
Not twice?

133
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:13,436
The Queen succeeded the First Wife position.

134
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:15,692
There was no need to re-enact a new wedding night.

135
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:20,611
Do you wish to grow old with me?

136
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:23,989
All girls under heaven

137
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:26,879
would want to grow old with their husband.

138
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:30,391
I am also this ordinary.

139
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:34,589
But I am scared.

140
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:35,900
Scared this is just wishful thinking.

141
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:41,920
You know that your ordinary wish

142
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:44,437
is hard to come by for me.

143
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:54,965
I value your wish;

144
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:55,687
I will not dissapoint you.

145
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,779
Don't cry.

146
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,832
Is there ink here

147
00:12:10,832 --> 00:12:12,196
What do you need ink for.

148
00:12:12,403 --> 00:12:13,633
I want to record it.

149
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:17,088
Your Majesty cannot go back on his word when it is in writing

150
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:19,410
So childish.

151
00:12:19,978 --> 00:12:22,915
I am Son of Heaven, I do not go back on my word.

152
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:24,056
Don't worry.

153
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,428
Rest early Your Majesty.

154
00:12:27,908 --> 00:12:29,575
You need to get up early tomorrow.

155
00:12:29,575 --> 00:12:32,016
How can I rest with you here?

156
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,824
Respects to young mistress

157
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:49,007
Meimei

158
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:50,039
Respects to Precious Shen

159
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,719
Jiejie came this early?

160
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:53,421
I originally wanted to pay my respects to the Empress

161
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:56,416
but she wasn't feeling well, so there's no need.

162
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,965
So I came to see you

163
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:03,594
Look at you...your undereye circles have darkened

164
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,835
Didn't sleep well last night?

165
00:13:06,382 --> 00:13:08,592
It's not that. Last night I was chatting with Pin of Respects.

166
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:09,939
It got late

167
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:13,085
Zhen jiejie has gone to the pavilion with his majesty.

168
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:15,531
She might have served his majesty last night.

169
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,054
Yes,

170
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:20,327
I wonder how's she doing.

171
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:23,373
To be sent back out of the Hall of Resting Soul...

172
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:25,578
I was probably the first.

173
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,189
Don't think about the past too much

174
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:36,900
It will be better next time

175
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:38,753
Next time?

176
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:41,671
How am I as fortunate as my two sisters?

177
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:45,665
When Zhen Jiejie returns, I will congratulate her

178
00:13:49,777 --> 00:13:51,103
I pay my respects to the Empress

179
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:19,586
Jian Qiu, quickly help Precious Wan up

180
00:14:19,886 --> 00:14:21,198
Yes, Niang Niang

181
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,992
Thanks Empress

182
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,103
Young mistress please get up

183
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:26,866
Please sit

184
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:33,566
You just recovered and returned to the palace

185
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:35,410
It's too hard for you to give a salute.

186
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,505
It's too hard for you to give a salute.

187
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:38,375
But the ancient rules dictate

188
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,143
that you have to came the day after serving his Majesty

189
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:42,517
so we have to follow it

190
00:14:43,044 --> 00:14:44,363
I should have come early

191
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:45,734
and give the salute.

192
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:48,265
But I was in pavilion, so I come late.

193
00:14:48,265 --> 00:14:49,917
It's my fault.

194
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,512
It's important to obey the rules

195
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:54,562
But it is more important

196
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:56,050
to search for a Win-Win Solution

197
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,627
You were in pavilion, accompany his Majesty,

198
00:14:58,627 --> 00:15:01,512
I'll be happy if his Majesty is happy.

199
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:03,722
These salutes are just formalities

200
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:06,086
It's kind of you, my Empress

201
00:15:06,086 --> 00:15:08,268
It's a fortune to the six palaces

202
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:10,540
that you're safe and sound.

203
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:13,241
No wonder his Majesty likes you

204
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:15,672
Your speech and actions are indeed endearing

205
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:17,849
Actually Meimei, with your beauty and talent,

206
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:19,526
you should have been favored long ago.

207
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:20,840
But until recently...

208
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:24,656
but not bad. Although through a lot

209
00:15:24,656 --> 00:15:27,162
the moon finally come out from behind the clouds.

210
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:29,609
Meimei, in the future come and go often

211
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:32,286
and treat this place like your own home. No need to feel uneasy.

212
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,223
Yes

213
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,322
I really like the fruity fragrance in Niang Niang's palace

214
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:40,069
It smells especially comforting

215
00:15:40,484 --> 00:15:42,595
Yes, I don't like to burn incense

216
00:15:42,595 --> 00:15:44,471
I also find cosmetic fragrances too common,

217
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:47,836
so I ask them to put fresh fruits in the hall everyday.

218
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:49,227
Turned out to be good.

219
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,590
Niang Niang's unique way

220
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,812
I learned a lot.

221
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,015
Ever since Precious Smile has been sick,

222
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:57,134
Niang Niang wanted to visit you many times.

223
00:15:57,134 --> 00:15:59,698
but young mistress were having seasonal epidemics

224
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:01,267
afraid of infection

225
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:02,578
didn't come.

226
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:04,136
But in Niang Niang's heart,

227
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:06,137
she often has concern for young mistress.

228
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:08,107
I'm appreciate Niang Niang's concern.

229
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,915
The choosing last year was

230
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:12,682
meant to pick conscientious girls to serve the Emperor

231
00:16:13,227 --> 00:16:15,677
Now, you just need to keep healthy.

232
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:19,372
only in this way, can you please the empire and rise offsprings.

233
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:22,810
I'll keep Niang Niang's words in heart

234
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,575
I'm so agreeable with you,

235
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:27,632
that I can't help concerning about you.

236
00:16:27,632 --> 00:16:29,180
It is too late now,

237
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,175
Jian Qiu, send Precious Wan out.

238
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:34,381
This is good

239
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:37,545
Young mistress

240
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:38,474
Xiao Yunzi?

241
00:16:38,474 --> 00:16:39,946
At this time why are you not in the palace?

242
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:41,058
Why did you come here?

243
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:42,279
First servant wants to congratulate young mistress

244
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:45,687
You're little monky, come for sweet thing specifically.

245
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:47,324
We won't forget you

246
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,148
Gugu misunderstands me

247
00:16:49,148 --> 00:16:50,447
I came here by imperial decree

248
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:51,609
Young mistress, for now please don't come back to the palace

249
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,075
Why?

250
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:53,925
Young mistress don't ask now

251
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:55,666
Please take a leisurely stroll through the royal garden

252
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,727
Very soon you will be able to return to the palace

253
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:58,587
Alright

254
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:05,836
Pin of Beauty Niang Niang, servant's stomach is not feeling well

255
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,460
Go

256
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,890
Although Kang Luhai now works for Jiejie,

257
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,799
he hasn't fixed his bad habit

258
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,172
of sneaking around at all.

259
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,748
Seeing as he once served Princess of Modesty,

260
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,933
I feel he is at least discreet.

261
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:23,886
Otherwise I wouldn't use him at all

262
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,111
Jiejie has such a good temperament

263
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:29,105
Abandoning a former master...

264
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:31,963
if it were me, I would absolutely not dare to do it.

265
00:17:36,693 --> 00:17:38,381
This royal garden is so pretty

266
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:39,211
Yes

267
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:41,808
Yes, the flowers in this royal garden

268
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:42,686
are different from those anywhere else.

269
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:45,843
Servant greets Precious Smile. Fortune and respects to Precious.

270
00:17:48,653 --> 00:17:49,925
It's Kang Luhai

271
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,827
Kang Luhai?

272
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,934
Young mistress still remembers servant?

273
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:55,610
Good morning Kang Gong Gong

274
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,011
You're not with Pin of Beauty?

275
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,488
Pin of Beauty and Precious Cao

276
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:02,094
went to pay their respects to the Empress.

277
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:05,328
Servant knew young mistress would pass through the royal garden on your way home

278
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:06,905
so I respectfully waited for you here.

279
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:12,268
Do you have some words from your Niang Niang?

280
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:14,925
No, it's not Niang Niang

281
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:19,383
It's just that servant has something selfish to request of young mistress

282
00:18:20,497 --> 00:18:21,604
Speak

283
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:27,610
Servant heard that young mistress was promoted to Precious,

284
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:30,831
and wholeheartedly wanted to pay my respects and regards to young mistress.

285
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:33,434
But I couldn't, I had too many errands

286
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:35,326
His Majesty also ordered a decree

287
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:37,168
to not disturb young mistress's rest.

288
00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:39,150
Servant longed for the stars and the moon,

289
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,752
so much that my neck is stretched out.

290
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:43,919
Until I pay my respects to young mistress, I won't have peace of mind

291
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,544
I like people who are direct

292
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,830
If you don't find servant too stupid,

293
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,646
with just one word from you,

294
00:18:49,646 --> 00:18:53,478
I am willing to serve young mistress without any hesitation.

295
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,085
Your intentions are good

296
00:18:56,994 --> 00:18:58,759
but does Pin of Beauty know?

297
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:00,601
This...

298
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:02,725
You are now her servant

299
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,804
If she knew of your thoughts,

300
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:06,375
I'm afraid she won't be too happy.

301
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:08,759
Besides, I am merely a Precious

302
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:10,393
How could I be at liberty

303
00:19:10,393 --> 00:19:12,464
to ask Pin of Beauty for her servant?

304
00:19:13,745 --> 00:19:15,746
Don't worry, you are in favour

305
00:19:15,746 --> 00:19:17,673
Just one word from you,

306
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,882
who would dare go against you?

307
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:21,525
Just one word from you is enough

308
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:24,401
Great! So you pretended to have a stomachache

309
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:25,709
and snuck out here

310
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:27,147
just so you could meet up with your former master!

311
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:31,240
Respect to Pin of Beauty NiangNiang.

312
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,234
Respect to Precious Cao

313
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,252
You and I are the same

314
00:19:36,252 --> 00:19:38,121
Meimei need not be so polite

315
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:41,282
You're also aware that you have the same status?

316
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:45,272
But she doesn't know her own status

317
00:19:47,932 --> 00:19:50,341
Right, I heard that lately his Majesty

318
00:19:50,341 --> 00:19:52,603
assigned quite a few servants to Precious Smile's palace.

319
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,525
Precious Smile doesn't already have enough servants

320
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:56,897
to order around?

321
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,649
To actually consider this useless servant of mine?

322
00:20:00,008 --> 00:20:01,444
Not like that

323
00:20:01,444 --> 00:20:03,298
Jiejie is so kind

324
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:04,895
to have received Kang Luhai

325
00:20:04,895 --> 00:20:06,829
Since he is already Jiejie's servant,

326
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:09,416
how could I ask for him back on my own will?

327
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,248
Although I'm young and inexperienced,

328
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:13,273
I would absolutely not make such a mistake.

329
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:16,009
Precious Smile does know the rules

330
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:17,978
No wonder his Majesty favors you so much

331
00:20:18,673 --> 00:20:20,822
I can only stay behind in the dust

332
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:23,875
His Majesty only pities me

333
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,177
because I was gravely ill recently.

334
00:20:25,177 --> 00:20:26,560
In his heart,

335
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,699
of course he cares about Jieijie 100 times more than me.

336
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:33,062
Confused servant!

337
00:20:33,062 --> 00:20:34,438
Upsetting Niang Niang first thing in the morning!

338
00:20:34,438 --> 00:20:35,632
Slap yourself!

339
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:38,679
Servant deserves to die!

340
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:39,639
Jiejie

341
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,682
Why upset yourself over a servant?

342
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:44,117
What if you damage your health?

343
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:46,627
Servant deserves to die!

344
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:49,071
This servant is bent on climbing the higher trees,

345
00:20:49,071 --> 00:20:50,833
too greedy.

346
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:53,245
we all say eunuchs are stupid ass without cock

347
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:55,198
they do not have one bit of dignity

348
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:57,765
These servants nowadays

349
00:20:57,765 --> 00:20:59,693
disregard me more and more.

350
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:02,794
They chase after those who are powerful,

351
00:21:03,236 --> 00:21:04,541
Why doesn't he think

352
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,050
of how he begged me back then

353
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,445
to dig him out of his live grave!

354
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:11,154
even learned to be a spy

355
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:15,446
Li jiejie, I know you're angry,

356
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:17,259
Not worth wasting

357
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:18,864
your words on a servant.

358
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,551
Disciplining a servant

359
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:25,143
I have ridiculed myself before Precious Smile

360
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,021
Since he's your servant,

361
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:28,380
Jiejie can punish him as you like.

362
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:30,855
to hit or kill, that is up to you

363
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:33,987
But there are many poeple in the garden

364
00:21:33,987 --> 00:21:35,734
it may cause gossips

365
00:21:36,513 --> 00:21:38,190
If you're so angry with him

366
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,149
you can take him back and then punish.

367
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:42,703
Alright,

368
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:44,648
I have to give the Empress my regards

369
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,975
Today, I show you some mercy.

370
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:49,003
Thanks! Li Pin Niangniang.

371
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,284
Thank you saved my life.

372
00:21:57,568 --> 00:21:59,224
Thank you my young mistress.

373
00:21:59,224 --> 00:22:00,303
You're clever,

374
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:02,540
If you didn't say in that way,

375
00:22:02,994 --> 00:22:05,232
Li Pin Niangniang couldn't have forgive me

376
00:22:05,894 --> 00:22:07,233
Li Pin may not forgive you

377
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:09,155
save your life on your own.

378
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:12,802
Li Pin and others dislike you

379
00:22:12,802 --> 00:22:14,406
you, you,

380
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:16,609
Shame on him, flunkyism.

381
00:22:17,157 --> 00:22:18,664
Even those maids around Li Pin

382
00:22:18,664 --> 00:22:20,386
can dress Kang Lu Hai down.

383
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:21,698
He's having a hard time.

384
00:22:22,401 --> 00:22:24,180
Servants should be loyal to thier boss.

385
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,324
Flip-floppers

386
00:22:26,324 --> 00:22:28,329
will not be used by others.

387
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:29,833
Kang deserves it.

388
00:22:30,385 --> 00:22:31,611
But Li Pin's words

389
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:32,862
were too tart and mean.

390
00:22:32,862 --> 00:22:34,975
I was aggrieved for you when hearing that.

391
00:22:34,975 --> 00:22:36,644
But I like her personality.

392
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:46,815
Congratulations, young mistress.

393
00:22:47,508 --> 00:22:51,524
The room is made into Pepper room, It is a great honor.

394
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:54,820
Congratulations, young mistress.

395
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:58,826
Young mistress, look our palace,

396
00:22:58,826 --> 00:23:00,189
so pretty.

397
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,796
Sweet! What's this smell?

398
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:11,257
It's wall! Young mistress, the wall gives out the smell!

399
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:14,635
It's his Majesty's command this morning.

400
00:23:14,635 --> 00:23:18,152
We servants made it in a short time.

401
00:23:18,152 --> 00:23:19,767
Hoping young mistress is pleased.

402
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:23,690
The pepper room is only used for newly-married.

403
00:23:24,087 --> 00:23:26,727
Using pepper flower mixed with mud, stands for warm and many seeds (children).

404
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,911
Except for the Empress,

405
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:31,139
no other princess can have this rare honor.

406
00:23:31,731 --> 00:23:33,965
Only Princess of Glory!

407
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:37,128
Congratulations young mistress!

408
00:23:37,128 --> 00:23:38,955
Young mistress, please go inside

409
00:23:51,925 --> 00:23:54,711
Young mistress, please look carefully at the bed

410
00:23:57,351 --> 00:24:00,074
Is this a routine for those who are favored?

411
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:03,901
Thank you for your arrange, Seneschal.

412
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:08,955
Yes,but except the good intention underneath.

413
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:26,098
His Majesty actually took my words to heart like this

414
00:24:27,054 --> 00:24:30,250
His Majesty heard this was a marriage custom among the among the people

415
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,099
and specially instructed us servants to do the same.

416
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,234
His Majesty also said if it wasn't for the hurry in the pavilions,

417
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:39,442
the present should have prepared already.

418
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:42,783
It's not the time matters, it's his Majesty's intention.

419
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:46,127
Alright alright, young mistress is tired from yesterday

420
00:24:46,127 --> 00:24:47,857
Let's take our leave

421
00:24:47,957 --> 00:24:49,129
Liuzhu, Huanbi

422
00:24:49,129 --> 00:24:51,228
can stay behind to serve young mistress in her rest.

423
00:24:52,002 --> 00:24:52,933
Yes

424
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:01,779
This is great, young mistress!

425
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:04,904
Now old master and madam can put their minds at ease!

426
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,233
Under the current circumstances,

427
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:09,291
his Majesty must really care about young mistress.

428
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,126
After suffering for more than half a year,

429
00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:12,513
we can rest assured.

430
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:15,382
You are right

431
00:25:15,382 --> 00:25:16,805
but the days ahead are still long.

432
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:18,826
The days ahead are long

433
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:20,636
but our young mistress's fortune is even longer.

434
00:25:30,901 --> 00:25:33,125
Everyone else is carried out to serve his Majesty

435
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,713
but you are different.

436
00:25:34,713 --> 00:25:36,916
His Majesty personally accompanies you there

437
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,503
Jiejie, you're laughing at me

438
00:25:40,576 --> 00:25:43,590
I'm not laughing at you. I'm happy that he favors you.

439
00:25:44,224 --> 00:25:47,742
But the other Pins might not be happy

440
00:25:47,988 --> 00:25:50,026
There is open strife and secret struggles in the palace. One rises as another falls.

441
00:25:50,026 --> 00:25:51,521
When has it ever stopped?

442
00:25:52,915 --> 00:25:54,101
With Pin of Beauty's temper

443
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:55,583
she can't hide any of her thoughts.

444
00:25:56,295 --> 00:25:57,990
She is more bark than bite,

445
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,168
I'm not afraid

446
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:02,229
You're right. Pin of Beauty is not a problem

447
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:04,869
but everyone knows that Princess of Glory stands behind her.

448
00:26:05,353 --> 00:26:06,940
Now that you're honored with the pepper room,

449
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,529
you are following in her exact footsteps.

450
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:14,095
Jiejie, that his Majesty would treat me this way...

451
00:26:14,095 --> 00:26:15,653
I didn't expect either.

452
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,322
These things came too quickly and too greatly

453
00:26:19,063 --> 00:26:20,762
Greater than my wildest expectations

454
00:26:22,775 --> 00:26:24,787
Jiejie, tell me. Is it real?

455
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:25,866
Of course it's real

456
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:28,128
Even I'm a bit envious

457
00:26:30,395 --> 00:26:32,038
His Majesty's love is real

458
00:26:32,752 --> 00:26:34,394
Pin of Beaulty's objections is real, too.

459
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:36,672
In the future, jealousy and hatred in the inner palace will also be real

460
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,390
Jiejie, tell me, what should I do?

461
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:43,100
Endure

462
00:26:43,572 --> 00:26:44,449
Endure?

463
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:46,418
Princess of Glory dominates

464
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:48,479
Even the Empress can't touch her

465
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:50,426
much less those of our status.

466
00:26:50,882 --> 00:26:52,406
You and I are newly favored.

467
00:26:52,406 --> 00:26:54,059
When it come to the extraction and his Majesty's favor.

468
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,958
we are not equal in force.

469
00:26:56,676 --> 00:26:59,451
Instead of acting up against greater forces, we should just wait calmly

470
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:03,124
So, you have to endure

471
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:05,004
You are right.

472
00:27:06,773 --> 00:27:09,569
But, Jiejie, will you be angry?

473
00:27:11,143 --> 00:27:14,181
We came into the palace together, I knew this would happen.

474
00:27:14,741 --> 00:27:17,203
Although his Majesty hasn't asked me serve for several days.

475
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:20,223
I still have the chance to lift my head in front of others since you are favored.

476
00:27:20,716 --> 00:27:22,295
We have been good friends for many years.

477
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:25,404
I envy you, but not angry.

478
00:27:28,877 --> 00:27:30,586
Jiejie, will you be jealous?

479
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:33,877
A little

480
00:27:34,814 --> 00:27:37,045
But there are many Princess who were favored in the palace

481
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:39,341
Princess of Glory, then you

482
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:41,055
and there will be others

483
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:44,120
If I am jealous of each one

484
00:27:44,741 --> 00:27:46,118
I would rather die.

485
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,712
the moon is full

486
00:27:51,226 --> 00:27:53,789
wonder if mom and dad are well at home

487
00:27:54,307 --> 00:27:55,696
mistress is homesick?

488
00:27:58,031 --> 00:28:00,370
being here by myself, how can I not?

489
00:28:01,894 --> 00:28:03,249
mistress is not alone

490
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,117
Precious Wan, Precious Shen

491
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:06,540
and you are like sisters

492
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,519
mistress should visit more

493
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:12,078
right now Wan mistress is being favoured

494
00:28:12,078 --> 00:28:14,178
You may meet his Majesty there.

495
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:16,293
Jiejie is favored now,

496
00:28:16,787 --> 00:28:19,366
If I always visit her

497
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:21,012
I will annoy them

498
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:23,371
why would that be? mistress is thinking too much

499
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,787
Precious Wan always shares her good fortune with mistress

500
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:28,651
Like this morning;

501
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:30,699
she event sent two bolts of silk over

502
00:28:31,637 --> 00:28:32,792
Jiejie was just being nice

503
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:36,128
No matter how strong the friendship is

504
00:28:36,698 --> 00:28:39,310
you will break it if you are careless.

505
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:41,994
For example

506
00:28:42,873 --> 00:28:44,131
Mei jiejie and Zhen jiejie are close friends.

507
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,116
but the day Zhen jiejie was favored

508
00:28:47,654 --> 00:28:49,369
Mei jiejie couldn't go to sleep that night

509
00:28:52,562 --> 00:28:55,019
Mistress, Shui Gong Gong of Rites has arrived

510
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,999
Greetings, Precious Wan

511
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,054
Why did gong gong come here himself?

512
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,025
His Majesty decreed

513
00:29:05,025 --> 00:29:09,510
to have servant personally come here to tell mistress

514
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,046
that you will be spending the night with the Emperor

515
00:29:14,472 --> 00:29:15,188
Thank you, Gong Gong

516
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:17,378
Your servant will take his leave

517
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:24,661
Mistress only came back the other day

518
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:25,940
But the Emperor wants to see you already

519
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,672
The Emperor really can't let you go

520
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:29,533
Don't talk rubbish

521
00:29:34,882 --> 00:29:38,747
This way, please. His Majesty is still busy with court petitions

522
00:29:38,747 --> 00:29:40,262
he will be here soon

523
00:29:40,754 --> 00:29:43,038
Mistress please make yourself at home

524
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:45,644
Don't I need to go cleanse myself and change?

525
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,810
His Majesty wants you to wait here

526
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,946
Mistress should just wait

527
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:52,840
Thank you, Gu Gu

528
00:30:18,472 --> 00:30:19,464
Your Majesty

529
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,809
Hungry? I have prepared some snacks for you

530
00:30:33,662 --> 00:30:35,087
Why did the kitchen only prepare one bowl?

531
00:30:37,595 --> 00:30:38,697
Your Majesty should eat first

532
00:30:39,334 --> 00:30:40,754
I already ate in my study

533
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:42,946
Try it and see if it is to your liking

534
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:45,033
Thank you, Your Majesty

535
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:54,799
It's raw! (have the meaning of "birth")

536
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,273
You said it yourself

537
00:31:16,937 --> 00:31:21,568
When my Precious Wan is angry, she is both cute and pitiful

538
00:31:25,025 --> 00:31:26,446
Your Majesty is mocking me

539
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:30,592
All right

540
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:33,712
I did not intend to mock you

541
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,787
This bowl of wanton

542
00:31:35,787 --> 00:31:38,516
was already eaten by you

543
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,789
I heard that commoner brides must eat wanton

544
00:31:42,947 --> 00:31:44,818
But the palace has rules and I

545
00:31:45,786 --> 00:31:46,879
can't do it exactly the same

546
00:31:48,162 --> 00:31:51,348
But if it can be done, I will definitely do it for you

547
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,072
Your Majesty treats me so well

548
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:00,980
When I first saw you in the Royal Garden

549
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:04,712
you stood alone in the shadows of apricot flowers

550
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,004
That peaceful and distant expression

551
00:32:11,104 --> 00:32:14,338
was as though the chaos of the back palace

552
00:32:14,338 --> 00:32:15,962
had nothing to do with you

553
00:32:17,056 --> 00:32:19,637
you stand aloof from the world

554
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:22,018
I am not as good as you just said

555
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,458
There are many others both beaultiful and talented in the palaces

556
00:32:27,828 --> 00:32:29,344
I am no match for them

557
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:31,496
Why compare yourself with them?

558
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:33,891
Zhen Huan is Zhen Huan

559
00:32:34,907 --> 00:32:36,784
You are the best in your way

560
00:32:50,816 --> 00:32:51,901
She just became the Precious in a few days

561
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:53,770
and could publicly poach my servants

562
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,652
What will she be like in future?

563
00:32:57,254 --> 00:32:59,502
It's because you don't discipline your servants well

564
00:33:00,205 --> 00:33:03,740
but when can you change your short temper?

565
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,584
You should learn from Precious Cao

566
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:10,921
I can't let let any sand leave in my eyes

567
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:13,688
His Majesty favours her

568
00:33:13,688 --> 00:33:15,495
so she will forget her place

569
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:20,556
As she forgets her place, His Majesty will stop liking her

570
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,278
Yu is an example

571
00:33:24,198 --> 00:33:25,958
Precious Wan is timid;

572
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:28,562
she is afraid of you, and gives in to you

573
00:33:30,528 --> 00:33:33,480
She didn't forget herself, but you lost your temper

574
00:33:34,506 --> 00:33:35,908
Forgot your propriety

575
00:33:36,935 --> 00:33:38,817
She is merely a new favourite

576
00:33:39,948 --> 00:33:41,087
Newly favoured?

577
00:33:41,696 --> 00:33:43,678
His Majesty gave her a pepper room

578
00:33:43,678 --> 00:33:45,895
apparently following you

579
00:33:46,661 --> 00:33:48,892
His Majesty often went to the palaces this month

580
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:51,622
nine out of ten were Precious Wan accompanying him

581
00:33:52,427 --> 00:33:54,704
If you don't talk, then will you become a mute? (Stop talking)

582
00:33:58,374 --> 00:34:00,189
Niangniang, have you seen good dogs

583
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:02,646
The dog that can bite don't bark

584
00:34:14,915 --> 00:34:16,917
Earlier than yesterday

585
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:19,555
I was always wondering when the night would come.

586
00:34:19,555 --> 00:34:21,330
I played chess with majesty this afternoon

587
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,365
and went back at dinner time

588
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:25,528
One-day's apart, feels like many years

589
00:34:25,528 --> 00:34:27,055
one-meal's time

590
00:34:27,055 --> 00:34:29,602
I felt like have spent a year

591
00:34:34,996 --> 00:34:38,346
Precious Wan, served the night before last.

592
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,705
and then last night

593
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,016
This afternoon, she played chess with his Majesty

594
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:46,611
and now, she is still in Hall of a resting soul

595
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:48,475
Doxy

596
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,752
Always hanging around the emperor

597
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,854
Because his majesty likes it that way

598
00:34:53,381 --> 00:34:55,277
Anyone else would be unable to even if she wanted to

599
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:57,657
As arrogant as Yushi was,

600
00:34:57,657 --> 00:34:59,721
she's better than her.

601
00:35:02,408 --> 00:35:03,959
Pavilion records

602
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,090
Slut!

603
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,131
Slut!

604
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,564
You will die a horrible death!

605
00:35:10,913 --> 00:35:13,877
Slut!

606
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:16,293
You will die a horrible death!

607
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:19,792
Slut! Die a horrible death!

608
00:35:25,862 --> 00:35:27,570
I pay my respects to the Empress

609
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,692
I came late. Niang Niang please forgive me.

610
00:35:30,918 --> 00:35:34,143
Not late. You're young, it's understandable to oversleep.

611
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:36,024
Many thanks Niang Niang for empathizing

612
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:42,023
I...pay my respects to all the sisters

613
00:35:45,197 --> 00:35:46,237
Rise

614
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:47,540
Thanks Empress

615
00:35:50,886 --> 00:35:52,793
You've worked hard serving the Emperor the past couple days

616
00:35:52,793 --> 00:35:55,540
It wasn't convenient for me to send things to you

617
00:35:55,991 --> 00:35:58,261
The Lama Masters of Tibetan Buddhism contributed a few

618
00:35:58,261 --> 00:36:00,560
consecrated blissful quilt with word "wan" to us.

619
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,502
I left one for you

620
00:36:02,502 --> 00:36:03,509
If you use it to sleep in,

621
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:04,973
you may have a prince soon.

622
00:36:06,794 --> 00:36:08,131
Many thanks Empress

623
00:36:08,692 --> 00:36:09,608
But of course

624
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:11,789
If you have a prince soon,

625
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:14,571
you can catch up to Princess of Regularity.

626
00:36:18,336 --> 00:36:20,133
Princess of Regularity has good fortune

627
00:36:20,133 --> 00:36:21,549
Make sure not to have bad fortune

628
00:36:21,549 --> 00:36:23,214
like 4th Prince's mother.

629
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:25,779
Not even a glance at 4th Prince...

630
00:36:25,779 --> 00:36:27,526
Why are you bringing up 4th Prince again?

631
00:36:27,887 --> 00:36:29,586
Are you at liberty to comment on the princes?

632
00:36:30,794 --> 00:36:32,549
Fine if you choose to talk about this at the Palace of Benevolent Hope

633
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:34,237
But if His Majesty hears of this,

634
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:36,110
he will be angry.

635
00:36:39,842 --> 00:36:42,948
Pin of Beauty, 4th prince's birth mother does not have good fortune

636
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:45,944
then why bother mentioning her?

637
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:48,806
Enough, you have all paid your respects. Everyone leave now.

638
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:51,026
I have to pay my respects to the Empress Dowager now

639
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,948
We respectfully send the Empress out

640
00:37:00,203 --> 00:37:02,863
Why did you have to mention 4th Prince?

641
00:37:02,863 --> 00:37:04,361
Upset now?

642
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,493
Being upset only hurts oneself

643
00:37:09,484 --> 00:37:10,355
What are you afraid of?

644
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:19,104
Who is 4th Prince? Who is his birth mother?

645
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,368
Someone so kind like the Empress...

646
00:37:21,368 --> 00:37:23,034
why did she get upset when he was mentioned?

647
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:24,397
I'm not sure either

648
00:37:24,397 --> 00:37:26,188
I've only heard others vaguely mention it

649
00:37:26,188 --> 00:37:28,486
4th Prince's birth mother was lowly and ugly

650
00:37:28,486 --> 00:37:29,886
The Emperor dislikes her extremely

651
00:37:29,886 --> 00:37:31,654
and as a result, also dislikes 4th Prince.

652
00:37:31,654 --> 00:37:33,596
So they've been kept in Yuan Ming Garden Pavilion

653
00:37:33,596 --> 00:37:34,598
and are not allowed to enter the palace.

654
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,906
If 4th Prince's birth mother is lowly and ugly,

655
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:38,605
why did His Majesty take interest in her?

656
00:37:39,572 --> 00:37:40,595
Lower your voice

657
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,795
His Majesty was supposedly still a Duke at the time

658
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:45,937
It was a drunken mistake

659
00:37:45,937 --> 00:37:48,645
For this incident, he was also harshly reprimanded by the late emperor.

660
00:37:48,645 --> 00:37:51,575
At that time, nine princes strove for the throne,

661
00:37:51,575 --> 00:37:53,370
No wonder His Majesty takes his anger out on 4th Prince

662
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,562
This is a hugely forbidden subject in the palace

663
00:37:55,562 --> 00:37:57,027
Just pretend you don't know

664
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,033
Thanks Jiejie for warning me

665
00:38:00,926 --> 00:38:04,056
Greetings Princess of Glory. Greetings Pin of Beauty.

666
00:38:04,056 --> 00:38:05,503
Get up

667
00:38:05,503 --> 00:38:06,679
Thanks Niang Niang

668
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:08,938
Precious Wan has always paid respects to the Empress

669
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:09,999
early in the morning.

670
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:13,246
Why were you late today? It's uncommon.

671
00:38:13,246 --> 00:38:16,020
Sisters are diligent. I was lazy.

672
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:19,319
I dare not say you are lazy

673
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:22,017
You must be tired from serving His Majesty

674
00:38:22,017 --> 00:38:25,270
unlike us, idle with so much free time.

675
00:38:26,062 --> 00:38:27,770
Pin of Beaulty has served his majesty for a long time

676
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,790
must know a saying-- do not say things which are not conform to the rites

677
00:38:30,814 --> 00:38:33,503
I am still young, I hope for more advice from Niang Niang

678
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:36,642
I haven't been in the palace for long. I have little experience.

679
00:38:36,642 --> 00:38:38,558
If I have misspoken,

680
00:38:38,558 --> 00:38:40,856
I hope that Niang Niang won't take offense.

681
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:46,449
Lately Precious Wan has been busy serving His Majesty

682
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:48,678
Precious Shen must be free

683
00:38:48,957 --> 00:38:50,371
Do you have time

684
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:52,400
to copy the female Analects of Confucius for me?

685
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:56,509
It will also remind people in the harem to scrupulously abide by the model female,

686
00:38:56,509 --> 00:38:58,027
to speak and act cautiously.

687
00:38:58,516 --> 00:39:01,087
Niang Niang's orders, how could I not comply with?

688
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,813
But, when would Niang Niang like it by?

689
00:39:03,813 --> 00:39:06,644
Not a hurry, take your time copying

690
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:10,165
When I want it, I will send someone to get it

691
00:39:18,075 --> 00:39:20,551
Precious Shen seems thinner

692
00:39:21,197 --> 00:39:23,651
Is it because His Majesty hasn't called for you lately?

693
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:26,188
Niang Niang jokes with me

694
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,595
But, it's because of the hot and muggy weather. I don't have an appetite.

695
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,492
I see

696
00:39:33,797 --> 00:39:37,189
I thought it was Precious Wan's being favored

697
00:39:37,189 --> 00:39:38,430
makes you sick

698
00:39:40,074 --> 00:39:41,328
I dare not

699
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:46,583
Precious Wan is smart and pretty. Being chosen to attend to His Majesty

700
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,011
is common sense.

701
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,209
Never mind if you are anyone else

702
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:52,927
Precious Wan and Precious Shen are close sisters

703
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:55,169
how can you forget to share with your sister

704
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:57,946
when you are specially favored
