00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:2,000
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Legend of Zhen Huan Team

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,100
<i> ~ Episode 9 ~</i>

3
00:00:03,085 --> 00:00:05,375
Precious Wan and Precious Shen are close sisters

4
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:07,892
How could you forget to share with your sister

5
00:00:07,892 --> 00:00:10,536
when you were specially favored

6
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:19,118
Niang Niang wants me to copy the female analects of Confucius

7
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:20,978
for the purpose of instructing the women in the harem.

8
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:22,764
How could I not know

9
00:00:22,764 --> 00:00:25,592
that jealousy and hate are unvirtuous?

10
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:28,122
Although I am untalented and slow,

11
00:00:28,122 --> 00:00:30,360
I absolutely wouldn't dare be unvirtuous.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,347
Although you may be virtuous,

13
00:00:32,347 --> 00:00:34,265
others might not be the same.

14
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,280
I've been in the palace for many years

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,449
Cold-blooded

16
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:41,842
and constantly changing hearts I've seen many cases of.

17
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,083
Many thanks Niang Niang for your reminder

18
00:00:45,556 --> 00:00:47,834
Niang Niang has already asked Jiejie to copy the Confucian analects

19
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:49,393
in order to instruct the harem women

20
00:00:49,393 --> 00:00:51,597
against fighting over favor

21
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:52,554
and causing disturbances.

22
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:56,391
Niang Niang has really give much thought to the matter. We will most certainly comply.

23
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:00,531
Precious Wan's words sound so good

24
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:04,120
Precious Shen and Precious Wan have been here for a while

25
00:01:04,676 --> 00:01:06,748
Your sweet-talking skills are getting good

26
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:09,706
You can't be overlooked

27
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:15,297
I got up early to pay respects to Empress

28
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:17,730
and then talked too much just now, really tired

29
00:01:18,843 --> 00:01:19,950
Let's go back

30
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:33,152
Today you have seen with your own eyes

31
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,000
Never mind Princess of Glory

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,020
Jiejie, do you blame me?

33
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:45,033
If it's not you, it will be someone else

34
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:47,725
If it's someone else, I'd rather it be you

35
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:50,751
Don't blame me for saying something selfish

36
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:52,581
If someone else is favored,

37
00:01:52,581 --> 00:01:54,694
I'm afraid that one day she will harm me.

38
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:57,294
Huan'er, you wouldn't

39
00:01:58,811 --> 00:01:59,902
Mei Jiejie

40
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:01,414
Among so many people in the palace,

41
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:03,627
the only one I can trust is you.

42
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,827
Although Lingrong is good friends with us,

43
00:02:05,827 --> 00:02:07,991
after all she did not grow up together with us.

44
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:11,682
If even you and I cannot support each other,

45
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:14,350
then how can the next 10 years

46
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,247
be endured?

47
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:20,900
Jiejie, it is not what I'm supposed to be

48
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:23,866
and I can't avoid it on my own

49
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:26,671
but no matter whether I was favored or not

50
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:28,847
you are always my good sister

51
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:32,061
even I was favored by his majesty

52
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:35,132
please don't break up with me

53
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:39,497
Being favored is not a surprise because of our talent

54
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:42,873
even if it's not forever

55
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:44,759
we must keep alive,

56
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,407
and not involve our relatives

57
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:55,473
Why are you awake

58
00:02:59,473 --> 00:03:01,275
I can hear the rain outside.

59
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:05,751
can't sleep, you are worried

60
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,352
No

61
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:09,712
Don't lie to me

62
00:03:13,623 --> 00:03:16,844
Your Majesty, I am afraid

63
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,493
I'm here, what are you afraid of

64
00:03:25,477 --> 00:03:27,102
You are very kind to me

65
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:32,674
Have you ever heard that the most favored

66
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:35,311
is also the most hated

67
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,354
Does anyone give you troubles

68
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:42,048
No, no one gave me troubles

69
00:03:44,718 --> 00:03:46,596
The palaces will be peaceful only if each one recives equal amount of rains

70
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:50,286
In this way we can continue the Royal Genealogy and fortune

71
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:53,562
I dare not be the most and only favored one

72
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,239
What if I don't agree?

73
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:03,958
The Feis and Pins in the palaces have complicated relations with the former dynasty

74
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:06,693
A slight move in one part may affect the whole situation.

75
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:08,650
Your majesty is a wise emperor

76
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:11,443
A wise emperor?

77
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:13,951
It has been seven days

78
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,274
Your majesty has lots of government affairs

79
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,741
if the harem is fulled of hatred,

80
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,318
you will be worried

81
00:04:23,152 --> 00:04:24,651
If your majesty only favors me

82
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:26,477
and desolates the others,

83
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:29,291
they will inevitably say that

84
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,806
men are fickle, love the new and loathe the old

85
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:37,366
I can't let your majesty worriy,

86
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,203
I know

87
00:04:55,524 --> 00:04:57,178
Your son is here to show his respect for the Empress Dowager

88
00:04:57,178 --> 00:04:59,157
Bless the Empress Dowager

89
00:04:59,943 --> 00:05:00,623
Sit down

90
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:01,919
Thank you, Empress Dowager

91
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:11,667
The Emperor looks healthy

92
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,233
The person who recently serves the Emperor, is she smart?

93
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:19,485
Your son really likes the new Wan precious

94
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:24,998
Wan precious? I haven't heard you mention her before

95
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:27,146
She is the one who entered the Palace last year

96
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:28,816
the smart and clever girl who got picked

97
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:31,754
She was ill before. She became well only recently

98
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:34,549
That is good

99
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,931
The most important thing for the Emperor

100
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:38,825
is to have someone intimate besides you

101
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:41,018
Dont be like No. 17

102
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:44,542
Even now he is still not settled down, and marry a wife

103
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:50,447
I have not seen him coming into Palace recently

104
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:52,362
I do know what is he busily doing

105
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:54,131
Empress Dowager, if you miss him

106
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,917
I will ask him to come in at noon

107
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,948
No. 17 is filial

108
00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:02,080
However when I see him

109
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,285
I will be reminded about the time when former Emperor was alive

110
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:08,840
His mother Princess Shu was the only favored one in the Palace

111
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:11,761
All other princess were jealousy.

112
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:12,938
I was not happy about that period,

113
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:19,856
I am getting older. When I have free time, I will think too much

114
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:21,803
So I would be nagging

115
00:06:23,023 --> 00:06:25,581
Every words said by the Empress Dowager is precious. I understand

116
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:28,819
Next time when the Empress Dowager has time

117
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:30,812
I will send Wan Precious to you

118
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:32,468
Please teach her

119
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,079
There are a lot of ladies in the harem, more than flowers

120
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:37,916
Those with precious titles

121
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:41,335
are just like the daisies covering the whole ground

122
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:42,762
They are all over the place

123
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:46,982
When she gets rasied to Pin position,

124
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:48,444
then I will see her

125
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:50,437
Okay

126
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:52,326
Sun gugu

127
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,027
These 2 days the Empress Dowager was not feeling well

128
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:56,255
Did the Princess of Glory come to visit?

129
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,588
The Princess of Glory was too busy helping manage the harem.

130
00:06:58,588 --> 00:07:01,576
This morning the Empress came

131
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:03,054
She left after serving medicine to the Empress Dowager

132
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:05,425
Yesterday the Pin of Beauty came

133
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,845
She chatted together with the Empress Dowager

134
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:08,860
The Pin of beauty

135
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,764
The nameplate of the Pin of beauty

136
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:38,340
How could it be covered with dust?

137
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:40,212
Send it back and make a new one

138
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,910
These 2 days

139
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,448
Dont just send in some random nameplates for the Emperor

140
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,108
Princess of Regularity

141
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:03,787
Eunuch Xiao Xia Zi. Why are you here?

142
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:06,055
Niang Niang

143
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:08,036
The Emperor is coming to the Hall of Ever Spring

144
00:08:08,332 --> 00:08:09,712
Your servant come to let you know first

145
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:11,116
NiangNiang, please get ready to welcome the Emperor

146
00:08:11,803 --> 00:08:12,902
The Emperor is coming?

147
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:16,587
Is the Emperor really coming?

148
00:08:16,587 --> 00:08:17,439
Yes

149
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:20,149
Hurry up to put this away

150
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:21,367
And that

151
00:08:21,804 --> 00:08:22,389
Niang Niang

152
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:23,835
NIangNiang, be careful

153
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:27,970
This is a mess

154
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,593
How could I welcome the Emperor

155
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:32,534
NiangNiang has served the Emperor many years

156
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:35,007
You already knew about Emperor's taste

157
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:37,622
The Emperor has not visited me for more then half a year

158
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,857
How come today he suddenly visit me?

159
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,394
NiangNiang, you are not happy?

160
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:48,023
Happy! Happy!

161
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:52,220
Go, bring a cloth for me.

162
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,582
I want a pink one

163
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:55,787
The Emperor likes me wear pink

164
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,668
Yes

165
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:57,556
Hurry up

166
00:08:57,952 --> 00:08:58,918
Yes, NiangNiang

167
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,895
Don't just stay here

168
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:03,683
Help me dress and groom

169
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:04,845
Yes, Niangniang

170
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,187
Oh. Hurry and get the 3rd prince for me.

171
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,149
Niangniang, it is rare for the Emperor to come

172
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,199
You should have some quality time with him

173
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:14,957
With the 3rd prince here

174
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:16,827
How could you talk with the Emperor intimately

175
00:09:18,093 --> 00:09:20,801
Yes. The child speaks too care free.

176
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:23,187
Let's avoid to make the Emperor upset again

177
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,920
Don't call him then. Hurry hurry! Dress me up.

178
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:27,266
Yes

179
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,345
Niangniang, your servant leaves now

180
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:36,424
Niangniang, drink swallow's nest and take a break

181
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:40,430
Did the Emperor flip her nameplate again?

182
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,613
The Emperor went to the Princess of Regularity

183
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,084
Why did he go there?

184
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,929
It does not matter who she is

185
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:48,607
as long as she is not Wan Precious

186
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:52,341
What time is it?

187
00:09:54,147 --> 00:09:56,019
The time is early. It just went dark

188
00:09:57,846 --> 00:09:59,987
Didn't the Emperor ask Precious Shen

189
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:01,285
to learn to look at account book?

190
00:10:02,223 --> 00:10:04,039
Let me teach her well

191
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:05,865
Call Precious Shen

192
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:07,879
Yes

193
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:11,288
The candles are too bright

194
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:13,716
Blow 2 candles out for me

195
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:16,836
Yes

196
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:31,001
Don't wait anymore, my lady

197
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,757
The Emperor turned the nameplate of Princess of Regularity today.

198
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:34,929
He went to the Palace of Ever Spring

199
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:38,987
That is good

200
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:41,675
What my lady just said

201
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,060
sounds happy yet also sounds unhappy

202
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,550
I am confused also

203
00:10:48,888 --> 00:10:50,526
I hoped his majesty not come

204
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:54,672
but it can't cheer me up when he really didn't come

205
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:42,415
Anyhow, Precious Shen is a girl from respectable families

206
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:45,430
how come the illegible handwriting

207
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,556
The candle light is too dim, I couldn't see it clearly

208
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:50,785
Please forgive me

209
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,682
You copied the account book yourself

210
00:11:52,682 --> 00:11:54,646
must know how huge the expense is in the harem

211
00:11:55,237 --> 00:11:57,639
I am the head of all the princesses

212
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,733
have to set an example to be economize

213
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:04,608
Besides, I heard that if one's handwriting is beaultiful

214
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:07,053
even the darkness can't bother

215
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:10,963
Your excuse is unconvincing.

216
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:14,053
What about I copy it again

217
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,963
Fine, I'll take a nap

218
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,428
Songzi, it's too bright here

219
00:12:22,004 --> 00:12:23,842
blow two more out

220
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:24,938
Yes

221
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:37,606
Sit

222
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:41,196
It's alright, I'll just stand to serve your majesty.

223
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:42,213
I'm not tired

224
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:44,878
You get in the light,

225
00:12:44,878 --> 00:12:46,276
how can I read

226
00:12:49,576 --> 00:12:50,657
get in the light

227
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:55,736
Your majesty, reading in the dim light is harmful for your eyes

228
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:59,092
Drink a cup of mum tea will keep you awake

229
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:01,645
Didn't you just let me drink the ginseng soup

230
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:05,252
I forgot

231
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:14,545
Your majesty, the 3rd prince grow taller

232
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,895
He is an adult, how come he "grow taller"

233
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,743
That's right. He's grown stronger.

234
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:22,977
He has followed Your Majesty's instructions

235
00:13:22,977 --> 00:13:25,198
and is practicing on the hunting grounds every day

236
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:26,982
Your Majesty's words

237
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:29,405
are previous to the 3rd prince

238
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:31,111
I hope so.

239
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,989
I hope that he will remember them

240
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:35,414
Yes, Your Majesty

241
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,006
The 3rd prince studies late into the night

242
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:41,345
and gets up before dawn to practice archery and horse riding

243
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,846
Whenever I see the 3rd prince,

244
00:13:44,846 --> 00:13:45,761
I will say

245
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:47,795
"Hong Shi,

246
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:51,367
you must follow your Father's instructions."

247
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:53,632
"You are your Father's oldest son

248
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,622
you must live up to his expectations."

249
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:58,896
"In the future, when your Father needs someone to share his burdens

250
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:01,751
it will fall to you."

251
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,683
These words of yours

252
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,377
will cause Hong Shi's ears to grow worms

253
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:09,109
My ears too

254
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,904
Don't you have anything else to teach your son?

255
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:14,998
Yes... I...

256
00:14:14,998 --> 00:14:17,346
This set of clothing doesn't look nice. Don't wear it anymore.

257
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:22,721
Your Majesty, I remember

258
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:26,915
that you liked it most when I wear pink.

259
00:14:27,273 --> 00:14:29,211
Pink is delicate and young

260
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:30,328
How old are you now?

261
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:35,322
Your Majesty thinks I'm old?

262
00:14:38,218 --> 00:14:39,540
I'm speaking the truth

263
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:44,045
Wearing blue or jade will suit your status better

264
00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:52,733
Sleep early

265
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:55,117
Your Majesty, where are you going?

266
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:56,740
I'm returning to the Hall of Resting Soul

267
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,656
Your Majesty!

268
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,067
Your Majesty!

269
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:12,939
Tell me, Princess of Regularity hasn't seen His Majesty for so long

270
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,076
she should be very happy, right?

271
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:18,624
Mistress, don't think too much

272
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:20,475
Get some rest

273
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,597
There is heavy rain, at Dongting Lake

274
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:40,638
There is heavy fog, at imperial mausoleum

275
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:43,870
I was looking forward to seeing you, but you didn't come

276
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,289
The surface of the lake ripples slightly

277
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:47,815
Mistress, stop playing

278
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:51,023
This song is called 'Princess Xiao's complaints'. It's inauspicious

279
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:56,090
Princess Xiao's complaints?

280
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,670
The palace girls' loves and hates

281
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,502
have never left behind deep marks

282
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:01,375
much less their complaints

283
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,439
What do I have to complain about?

284
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:06,343
I was the one that told him to go

285
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:20,497
Halt

286
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:25,975
Your Majesty, are we returning to Hall of Resting Soul?

287
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:27,767
Or are we going to Palace of Wings?

288
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:33,628
Palace of Shattered Jade

289
00:16:58,198 --> 00:16:59,415
Halt

290
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,776
Put down the palantine

291
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:18,986
This is Princess Xiang's Complaints

292
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,590
Your servant does not know this

293
00:17:24,073 --> 00:17:26,232
Obviously the song is full of sorrow and complaint

294
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:29,578
that her heart's desire has not returned home

295
00:17:31,771 --> 00:17:33,402
When I'm not around, she is unhappy

296
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:12,735
You've played with my heartstrings

297
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:15,786
Greetings, Your Majesty

298
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:17,966
Get up

299
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:19,140
Why is Your Majesty here?

300
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:21,950
I become thinner in order to miss someone is worth.

301
00:18:22,897 --> 00:18:25,348
I finally got the taste of that feeling

302
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:33,591
Aren't you supposed to be at Princess of Regularity's palace?

303
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,004
I've seen her

304
00:18:37,896 --> 00:18:40,145
On my way back, the moonlight was bright

305
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:42,667
so I wanted to come and see what you were doing

306
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:47,532
Such good playing, it's a good thing I didn't miss it

307
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,691
With your words, I have no where to hide my face

308
00:18:56,114 --> 00:18:57,619
The great and mighty ruler

309
00:18:57,619 --> 00:18:59,575
has actually learned to eavesdrop?

310
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:02,138
You're becoming more audacious

311
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:05,433
You shall be punished to play another song

312
00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:09,524
By coming here, Princess of Regularity will be upset

313
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,298
Can you bear to see me go to someone else?

314
00:19:15,011 --> 00:19:17,229
I've said that Your Majesty is a wise ruler

315
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,724
I will be a wise ruler tomorrow

316
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:24,078
Tonight, I shall be a confused ruler

317
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:25,863
Then I will be a virtuous concubine tomorrow

318
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:28,276
And ask Sister Qi for forgiveness

319
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:33,989
Dearest 4th, what tune would you like to hear?

320
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:37,114
What did you just call me?

321
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:39,643
I was being rude

322
00:19:39,782 --> 00:19:41,723
I like you calling me that

323
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:46,575
Your maiden name is Wan Huan, what number were you?

324
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,062
I didn't have a number

325
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:54,257
Then I shall call you Huan Huan, all right?

326
00:19:55,712 --> 00:19:56,773
Huan Huan?

327
00:20:37,351 --> 00:20:38,459
Finished copying?

328
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,946
I know that my calligraphy is not great

329
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:42,634
so I copied each ledger twice

330
00:20:42,634 --> 00:20:44,428
please take a look at them

331
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:51,704
It's late, go back and rest

332
00:20:52,735 --> 00:20:55,054
I will let you know when I have read them

333
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:58,337
Yes, I take my leave.

334
00:21:10,423 --> 00:21:12,502
Princess of Glory was clearly making things difficult for Mistress

335
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:13,967
There are only numbers on that ledger

336
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:15,406
Yet she purposely made the room dark

337
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:16,820
So that writing it once won't be enough

338
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,967
Mistress' eyes are red

339
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:21,554
What can I do?

340
00:21:22,374 --> 00:21:23,523
She is the Princess of Glory

341
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:27,198
Can't mistress tell the Emperor?

342
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,064
She's using His Majesty's instructions to teach me

343
00:21:31,064 --> 00:21:33,303
If I tell His Majesty,

344
00:21:33,303 --> 00:21:35,097
even if he helped me,

345
00:21:35,097 --> 00:21:38,965
would I be allowed to continue to learn how to manage the back palace?

346
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,509
Since I gain nothing out of it, I won't do it.

347
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:44,830
Your servant feels bad for you

348
00:21:46,152 --> 00:21:48,457
It's fine, I've passed that ordeal

349
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:51,985
This is near to the Thousand Carp pond

350
00:21:51,985 --> 00:21:54,281
Accompany me for a walk over there

351
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:56,793
I heard the Emperor added lanterns there

352
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:59,843
Red fishes are most beautiful at night

353
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:24,842
There's not much fish food left

354
00:22:24,842 --> 00:22:27,726
Xiaoshi, go and get more

355
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:28,430
Yes

356
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:33,577
Mistress, look

357
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:40,797
So Mistress is here

358
00:22:41,232 --> 00:22:42,833
Your servant had a hard time finding you

359
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,656
Why is Gu Gu coming out so late at night?

360
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,851
Does Niang Niang have any instructions for me?

361
00:22:46,851 --> 00:22:49,688
Niang Niang said that Wei Zhou just sent in some good ink as tribute

362
00:22:49,688 --> 00:22:52,826
and wanted to give some to you
But you left so quickly

363
00:22:53,818 --> 00:22:56,451
Caiyue, follow Gu Gu back

364
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:57,758
And leave you here alone?

365
00:22:57,758 --> 00:22:59,217
Go and return quickly

366
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:00,964
Yes

367
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:31,218
Help!

368
00:23:31,218 --> 00:23:32,376
Save me!

369
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:34,562
Help!

370
00:23:36,952 --> 00:23:38,650
His Majesty has arrived!

371
00:23:42,811 --> 00:23:44,939
Your Officials greet you, Your Majesty

372
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:46,165
Rise

373
00:23:46,165 --> 00:23:47,081
Thank you, Your Majesty

374
00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:47,797
How is Jiejie's condition?

375
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:51,484
Replying Precious Wan, Precious Shen is all right now

376
00:23:51,484 --> 00:23:53,555
She just swallowed some water and got scared

377
00:23:53,555 --> 00:23:55,060
and thus is still unconcious

378
00:23:56,224 --> 00:23:58,649
Your Officials have written prescriptions

379
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:01,613
As long as Precious Shen follows the instructions and rests

380
00:24:01,613 --> 00:24:04,501
she will recover quickly
It's just that...

381
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:06,825
Don't speak in starts and stops

382
00:24:06,825 --> 00:24:09,665
Yes. It's just that Mistress' shock is not light

383
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:12,422
I'm afraid she will have to rest for some time

384
00:24:12,422 --> 00:24:14,471
before she will regain her spirits

385
00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:17,294
You have been looking after Precious Shen

386
00:24:17,897 --> 00:24:19,868
make sure she recuperates

387
00:24:19,868 --> 00:24:20,620
Yes

388
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,959
Then Your Officials will go and brew her medicine

389
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:28,442
Don't bother with the bowing

390
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:34,081
Mei Jiejie

391
00:24:37,661 --> 00:24:39,464
How do you serve your mistress?

392
00:24:39,464 --> 00:24:41,719
Please punish us, Your Majesty

393
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:43,370
You were ordered to be careful

394
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,355
How did Precious Shen drown?

395
00:24:45,355 --> 00:24:47,492
Your servants are not sure!

396
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:49,937
This is ridiculous

397
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:52,098
You are Precious Shen's close servants

398
00:24:52,098 --> 00:24:53,416
How can you be unsure?

399
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:56,180
Your servants are maligned, we really do not know

400
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,699
Mistress was feeding the fishes at Thousand Carp Pond

401
00:24:57,699 --> 00:24:59,062
Your servant went to get more fish food

402
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:01,697
I was on my way when I heard the news

403
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:04,284
What about Caiyue?

404
00:25:05,663 --> 00:25:08,698
Songzhi said that Princess of Glory had some good ink that she wanted to give to Mistress

405
00:25:08,698 --> 00:25:11,487
but forgot to give it earlier, so she asked me to go get it

406
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:12,940
So what you're saying is that

407
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,118
when Precious Shen fell into the water,

408
00:25:14,118 --> 00:25:15,831
none of you were by her side?

409
00:25:23,393 --> 00:25:25,928
Your Majesty, Princess of Glory is here

410
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,906
It's already so late, why are you here?

411
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,178
I heard that Precious Shen nearly drowned

412
00:25:32,178 --> 00:25:33,326
and rushed over

413
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:35,148
Is Precious Shen all right?

414
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,922
Go and take a look

415
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,346
Yes

416
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:49,393
How pitiful, someone as delicate as her

417
00:25:49,393 --> 00:25:51,150
having to go through such an ordeal

418
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,755
Niang Niang please don't worry

419
00:25:52,755 --> 00:25:56,159
The physician has said that once she wakes up, Precious Shen will be fine

420
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:02,899
Your Majesty, the guards in the palace have not been patrolling well

421
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:04,914
that's why Precious Shen was not discovered in time

422
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:07,367
It's my fault for not handling the back palace well

423
00:26:07,994 --> 00:26:09,725
Please punish me

424
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,214
The night patrolling guards have their shifts

425
00:26:13,912 --> 00:26:15,828
If I punish you

426
00:26:16,956 --> 00:26:20,365
the Empress, as the Centre of the Inner Palace, will not be able to escape punishment either

427
00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:24,111
Ignorant fools, how do you serve your mistress?

428
00:26:24,111 --> 00:26:25,484
Letting His Majesty worry

429
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,196
Useless

430
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,923
These kinds of servants should not be kept around Precious Shen

431
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:35,518
I think they should be sent to the Bureau of Cautious Punishment

432
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,481
Your Majesty, Xiaoshi and Caiyue

433
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:40,881
have their bad points

434
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:44,241
but their actions do not warrant being sent there

435
00:26:44,955 --> 00:26:46,748
If we don't do this, it won't be enough

436
00:26:47,216 --> 00:26:48,921
If all the servants do their jobs thusly

437
00:26:48,921 --> 00:26:51,216
the imperial ponds will be full of drowning people

438
00:26:51,216 --> 00:26:53,649
The servants of Palace of Whole Blessings are incompetent

439
00:26:53,649 --> 00:26:55,602
Pin of Respect cannot escape punishment either

440
00:26:56,288 --> 00:26:58,098
I will listen to Niang Niang's teachings

441
00:26:58,632 --> 00:27:02,103
and punish them suitably

442
00:27:02,745 --> 00:27:05,589
Your servant is at fault for not looking after the Mistress

443
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,155
But Mistress hasn't woken up yet

444
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,112
Please let your servant take care of her until she wakes up

445
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:13,291
before going to the bureau to receive punishment!

446
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:14,981
Servants are cheap

447
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,967
Clinging onto this place because you want your mistress to plead for you when she wakes up?

448
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:22,855
Princess of Glory, please be generous

449
00:27:24,114 --> 00:27:26,900
Cai Yue and Xiaoshi may have been remiss in ther duties

450
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,431
but the whole accident cannot be blamed solely on them

451
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,705
Instead of punishing them,

452
00:27:31,705 --> 00:27:34,361
why not have them serve Mei Jiejie with dedication

453
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,321
to make up for their mistakes?

454
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,696
Does Precious Smiles think that offences should not be punished?

455
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:40,362
If we let them off lightly,

456
00:27:40,362 --> 00:27:42,714
there will be ugly rumours in the back palace

457
00:27:43,592 --> 00:27:45,981
The servants will think that they can atone for their missteps by making up for it

458
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:47,569
without getting punished

459
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:50,704
Niang Niang's distinction between reward and punishment is a must

460
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:52,907
But Caiyue and Xiaoshi

461
00:27:52,907 --> 00:27:54,792
have always served Mei Jiejie

462
00:27:54,792 --> 00:27:57,072
If we send them to the Bureau of Catious Punishment now

463
00:27:57,072 --> 00:27:59,360
Jiejie will not have any experienced servants by her side

464
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,492
That would be counter-productive

465
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,085
They can't even ensure Precious Shen's safety

466
00:28:04,085 --> 00:28:06,309
what's the use of keeping them by her side

467
00:28:07,082 --> 00:28:09,996
Furthremore, Thousand Carp Pond is less than a hundred paces from Palace of Wings

468
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:12,723
Such a thing happening within my territory

469
00:28:12,723 --> 00:28:14,865
How can I let them off lightly?

470
00:28:14,865 --> 00:28:16,734
I am worried about exactly that

471
00:28:17,111 --> 00:28:18,991
Niang Niang obviously differentiates between reward and punishment

472
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:20,615
But less-informed people will think

473
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,805
that because the incident happened near Place of Wings,

474
00:28:22,805 --> 00:28:24,609
it could have an impact on your reputation

475
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:25,997
which is why you are so impatient

476
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,823
and not because Precious Shen nearly drowned

477
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:31,533
Servants are insignificant, but Niang Niang's reputation is important

478
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:33,053
Please reconsider

479
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,750
Precious Smiles' words make sense

480
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:40,982
Why don't we wait for Precious Shen to wake up before deciding?

481
00:28:41,771 --> 00:28:45,464
At that time, it would not be too late to send them to the Bureau of Cautious Punishment

482
00:28:47,366 --> 00:28:50,774
I have one more thing to say, although I'm not sure if I should

483
00:28:50,774 --> 00:28:51,712
Speak

484
00:28:53,462 --> 00:28:55,189
Why Jiejie fell into the pond is still a mystery

485
00:28:55,189 --> 00:28:57,788
But it's the guards' who did not save in time

486
00:28:57,788 --> 00:29:00,001
thus making her inhale too much water and unconscious

487
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:01,962
In my opinion

488
00:29:01,962 --> 00:29:05,614
It's better to replace the guards in Palace of Wings

489
00:29:05,614 --> 00:29:07,751
Otherwise, this time is Mei jiejie

490
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:09,665
if there's another carelessness next time

491
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,533
and it hurts Princess of Glory, that is not good

492
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:15,347
Precious Smile said one can make up for his mistake just now

493
00:29:15,347 --> 00:29:18,553
Why are you suggest replacing the guards in my palace now

494
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:22,587
Isn't there too much partiality?

495
00:29:22,587 --> 00:29:25,387
I am just concerned about Niangniang

496
00:29:25,387 --> 00:29:27,983
His majesty always love Niangniang

497
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:31,681
How can his majesty let such careless servants protece Niangniang's palace

498
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:33,568
and put Niangniang into dangerous situation

499
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,998
Besides, it's only replace them

500
00:29:36,998 --> 00:29:39,053
not punish them

501
00:29:39,053 --> 00:29:41,476
It's not important

502
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:45,882
But such things can't happen anymore

503
00:29:45,882 --> 00:29:48,906
Tomorrw, I'll let Su Pei Sheng

504
00:29:48,906 --> 00:29:53,179
replace the guards in Palace of Wings

505
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:55,645
This way, I'll be more relieved

506
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,663
Thank you for Your Majesty's concern

507
00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:02,320
I got two superior wild ginsengs

508
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,367
It's the best choice to recover her body

509
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:13,072
You are concerned about the affairs in the Back Palaces all the time

510
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:15,572
It is too late for you to be working

511
00:30:15,572 --> 00:30:17,953
Go back and rest

512
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:21,121
Your majesty have to go to the Royal Court tomorrow

513
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:22,764
don't be too tired, too

514
00:30:22,764 --> 00:30:26,697
Befor I came, I asked the servants to cook the Dong-E-E-Jiao longan soup

515
00:30:26,697 --> 00:30:28,697
It must be ready now,

516
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:32,531
Your majesty may have some first and then rest

517
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,822
You are so considerate

518
00:30:36,515 --> 00:30:37,536
I'm hungry

519
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:42,042
Go with me and have some

520
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:46,151
the foods in Princess of Glory's palace are top-notch in the palaces

521
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:50,008
Your majesty overpraised me

522
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:54,622
Come with us, Precious smile

523
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:57,024
I don't have the luck to eat such good things

524
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,351
Your majesty, please eat my part for me

525
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:03,719
I want to take care of Mei Jiejie here

526
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:08,665
Alright, also take care of yourself

527
00:31:13,396 --> 00:31:14,739
We respectly send Your Majesty

528
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,540
and Princess of Glory out

529
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,854
His Majesty is leaving

530
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:24,085
It's too late at night

531
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:26,523
Pin of Respects go back early and rest

532
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:31,291
OK, don't be too tired

533
00:31:47,884 --> 00:31:49,736
Are you not weary, niangniang?

534
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:51,093
How about having some supper

535
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,360
Poor Precious Shen

536
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,833
What does Niang Niang think about tonight's incident?

537
00:32:00,803 --> 00:32:02,831
Dong-E-E-Jiao longan soup

538
00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:06,842
Princess of Glory was well prepared

539
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:10,283
Niang Niang has sharp ears and Precious Smile has sharp eyes

540
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:13,076
Princess of Glory was dressed too tidily

541
00:32:13,076 --> 00:32:15,363
She had every step planned out

542
00:32:15,363 --> 00:32:18,552
Right, want to act a fox

543
00:32:18,552 --> 00:32:21,159
she should hide her tail

544
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,368
But, what a pity, once get dizzy with success

545
00:32:25,368 --> 00:32:27,560
the tail came out itself

546
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,127
She is too busy to hide the tail

547
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:30,404
Having cooked the soup

548
00:32:30,404 --> 00:32:32,583
asking his majesty to go there is a must

549
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,598
she had to make up well

550
00:32:36,686 --> 00:32:38,313
His majesty was concerned about Precious Shen,

551
00:32:38,313 --> 00:32:40,016
may not see this

552
00:32:40,016 --> 00:32:43,047
Needn't we tell his majesty

553
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,050
no use

554
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:51,145
she has an eye on our Palace of Whole Blessings

555
00:32:51,145 --> 00:32:53,368
mean to pick a hole in us

556
00:32:53,368 --> 00:32:56,411
do we need to make it for her?

557
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:04,457
It's almost fourth watch of the night, young mistress, you need a rest

558
00:33:06,713 --> 00:33:08,904
I can't sleep, I'm worried

559
00:33:10,345 --> 00:33:11,441
Servant is also worried

560
00:33:11,441 --> 00:33:12,981
Servant just can't believe

561
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:15,477
young mistress could fell into the water herself

562
00:33:15,477 --> 00:33:16,735
Think carefully

563
00:33:16,735 --> 00:33:18,444
at that time

564
00:33:18,444 --> 00:33:21,037
did you see anything strange

565
00:33:21,037 --> 00:33:24,305
Of course, this is merely my conjecture

566
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:26,425
Why the acident happen to jiejie

567
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:28,357
once you are not with her

568
00:33:28,357 --> 00:33:31,240
Now, jiejie is unconscious

569
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,114
If you miss something

570
00:33:33,114 --> 00:33:35,524
we'll all be fooled

571
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:37,764
Servant know this is very important

572
00:33:37,764 --> 00:33:39,878
but servant didn't see it clearly

573
00:33:39,878 --> 00:33:41,174
so I dare not to say

574
00:33:41,174 --> 00:33:42,227
It's very important

575
00:33:42,227 --> 00:33:44,133
so you should speak everything out

576
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:48,812
When servant got the ink and went back

577
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:51,528
there may be a little Eunuch

578
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:53,086
slide out of the pond

579
00:33:53,086 --> 00:33:54,808
Because of the darkness

580
00:33:54,808 --> 00:33:56,502
I'm not sure if it's my eyes' illusion

581
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:58,587
Anyone else know this?

582
00:33:58,587 --> 00:34:00,500
Servant really don't dare to tell any others

583
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,696
Remember

584
00:34:02,696 --> 00:34:06,612
don't tell anyone else

585
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:07,625
Yes

586
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:17,844
Because of the slut's one word

587
00:34:17,844 --> 00:34:20,535
his majesty replaced all the guards around me

588
00:34:20,535 --> 00:34:23,587
making it inconvenient for me to get in and out.

589
00:34:23,587 --> 00:34:25,364
Niangniang, don't be angry

590
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:27,718
it's harmful to your body

591
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,493
how dare she set foot on my head

592
00:34:32,493 --> 00:34:34,333
Niangniang, don't worry

593
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,055
Now, she is favored

594
00:34:36,055 --> 00:34:38,466
there are many people hate her

595
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:42,122
Who is serving Yu?

596
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:44,826
I heared she has lost the emperor's favor, and is in a foul temper

597
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:48,839
she has even driven out the only maid by her side - she is pitifully alone

598
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,959
Your servant Kang Lu Hai is useless,

599
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:54,687
but is his junior loyal?

600
00:34:54,687 --> 00:34:56,485
You are referring to Xiao Yin Zi, Niang Niang?

601
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:59,854
He is not as scheming as his master,

602
00:34:59,854 --> 00:35:01,084
but he is more useful

603
00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:04,276
Let him serve Yu

604
00:35:07,677 --> 00:35:10,164
This ink stick is a tribute from the governor of Shangdong

605
00:35:10,164 --> 00:35:12,859
Forgive my ignorance - I cannot identify it

606
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:14,628
I do require your guidance, Niang Niang

607
00:35:14,628 --> 00:35:18,110
This is called Literate Double Mandarin Ducks ink

608
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,976
It is as solid as a jade and has an even consistency,

609
00:35:20,976 --> 00:35:23,436
adorned with carvings of mandarin ducks on both sides,

610
00:35:23,436 --> 00:35:27,362
and plated with gold. This is ink of the highest quality.

611
00:35:27,362 --> 00:35:28,931
Your humble servant knows not the others,

612
00:35:28,931 --> 00:35:31,177
except the prosperous significance of the mandarin ducks

613
00:35:31,177 --> 00:35:33,986
His Majesty and you, Niang Niang, are in harmony

614
00:35:33,986 --> 00:35:35,494
just like the pair of mandarin ducks

615
00:35:35,494 --> 00:35:38,226
He is able to cater to my pleasure

616
00:35:39,858 --> 00:35:41,322
But as good as this ink stick is

617
00:35:41,322 --> 00:35:43,089
it never can compare with Palace of Wings's ink

618
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:44,596
when it comes to use

619
00:35:44,596 --> 00:35:48,352
Palace of Wings's ink is used as a trap to kill someone

620
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:51,611
Though of big use, does bad things

621
00:35:51,611 --> 00:35:54,183
Some things don't have to be said aloud

622
00:35:54,183 --> 00:35:55,189
Yes

623
00:35:55,189 --> 00:35:58,913
But Niangniang, do you really want to leave this alone

624
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:03,464
You saw how arrogant the Princess of Glory was when she paid her respects to me

625
00:36:03,464 --> 00:36:04,940
From this, you can see

626
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,716
how his majesty has decided how to deal with this case

627
00:36:08,665 --> 00:36:11,698
Even though I want to give a hand, I can't

628
00:36:11,698 --> 00:36:13,401
Anyway, we all know

629
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:15,607
who did it

630
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,558
His majesty doesn't know

631
00:36:17,558 --> 00:36:20,375
so it makes no sense even though we all know

632
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:24,181
His majesty only wants peace in the harem

633
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:28,353
somethings will end up with no definition

634
00:36:30,457 --> 00:36:33,321
Send some tonic to Precious Shen

635
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:34,984
Yes

636
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:48,192
Jiejie, you're awake?

637
00:36:48,192 --> 00:36:51,533
Are you hungry? Do you want to eat something?

638
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:53,584
Huan'er

639
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:56,674
Someone wants to kill me

640
00:36:58,745 --> 00:37:03,080
Jiejie, did you see who it was?

641
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,538
He pushed me into the water from the back

642
00:37:05,538 --> 00:37:07,854
I could not see him clearly

643
00:37:07,854 --> 00:37:10,937
I just know that he had an inordinate amount of strength

644
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:14,316
It was either a eunuch or a guard

645
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,064
There are thousands of guards and eunuchs in the palace

646
00:37:18,064 --> 00:37:21,332
Did you see who it exactly is?

647
00:37:21,332 --> 00:37:26,350
Though palace's inhabitants are duplicitous

648
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:30,578
it is unthinkable that they are malevolent to the point of plotting my death

649
00:37:32,832 --> 00:37:34,888
To be able to do this...

650
00:37:34,888 --> 00:37:36,542
There is only one...

651
00:37:42,062 --> 00:37:45,609
But the Thousand Carp Pond and her Palace of Wings are so near

652
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:47,375
If she wanted to deal with me

653
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,551
she should not choose to do it on her own territory

654
00:37:49,551 --> 00:37:51,990
She should know to avoid suspicion

655
00:37:52,779 --> 00:37:54,393
Avoid suspicion?

656
00:37:54,393 --> 00:37:56,650
I don't think she wants to avoid suspicion at all

657
00:37:58,162 --> 00:37:59,623
Coming here in full regalia in the middle of the night

658
00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:02,416
throwing her weight around in your palace

659
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:05,296
and nearly getting rid of Caiyue and Xiaoshi

660
00:38:05,296 --> 00:38:08,276
She even invited His Majesty to her palace

661
00:38:10,692 --> 00:38:12,136
You just left the Palace of Wings

662
00:38:12,136 --> 00:38:14,794
and then fell into the pond after only a short time

663
00:38:15,906 --> 00:38:17,440
Nowadays in the palaces

664
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,773
who would dare make trouble in her territory?

665
00:38:21,597 --> 00:38:24,519
Only she would dare to do so

666
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:26,786
By doing the unexpected

667
00:38:26,786 --> 00:38:30,783
Others will not suspect

668
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:33,205
She saw that you had gained the emperor's favor

669
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:36,034
and was afraid that we would join hands to gain power

670
00:38:36,034 --> 00:38:37,947
until she has no hold against us

671
00:38:37,947 --> 00:38:41,002
So she thought to get rid of one of us

672
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:43,620
so that our influence would be weakened

673
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,364
and we'll be defenseless against her.

674
00:38:48,186 --> 00:38:49,560
I'm sorry, Jiejie.

675
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:51,933
I have implicated you.

676
00:38:53,288 --> 00:38:54,999
It's not your fault

677
00:38:56,153 --> 00:38:58,420
When I was being favoured

678
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,183
she already hated me

679
00:39:01,862 --> 00:39:04,277
But it's his majesty's favour

680
00:39:04,277 --> 00:39:07,263
and my tolerance and deference

681
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:10,590
that stayed her hand

682
00:39:12,064 --> 00:39:13,142
Now

683
00:39:14,913 --> 00:39:16,654
What do you intend to do?

684
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:19,346
What can I do?

685
00:39:20,364 --> 00:39:21,855
I have no evidence

686
00:39:22,786 --> 00:39:24,936
And she has long had His Majesty's love

687
00:39:24,936 --> 00:39:28,370
I will tell His Majesty

688
00:39:29,824 --> 00:39:31,609
that I fell into the water

689
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:37,182
out of carelessness on my own part

690
00:39:39,465 --> 00:39:44,337
It seems like that's our only solution

691
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:48,926
I can't afford to offend her now

692
00:39:50,247 --> 00:39:53,157
but it doesn't mean that this will be the case forever

693
00:39:53,878 --> 00:39:55,703
At least I still have my life

694
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:01,055
We'll settle our scores with her one day

695
00:40:02,754 --> 00:40:07,159
