<i> ~ Episode 10 ~</i>

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,518
Now, the Internal Affairs Authority

4
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:11,497
chooses the best thing and sends to us

5
00:00:11,497 --> 00:00:13,496
Everyone knows that his majesty loves young mistress

6
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:15,509
And his majesty asked imperial physician Wen

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,106
to make herbal tonic for you once a day

8
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:18,467
It's not that good as you think

9
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:19,813
the tonic is very bitter

10
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:25,763
Oh, by the way, Yu is so mean

11
00:00:25,763 --> 00:00:27,629
I heared that after she moved out of Palace of Essence

12
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,606
she curses young mistress all the time

13
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:31,485
Leave her alone

14
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,656
I haven't done anything bad.

15
00:00:33,656 --> 00:00:35,588
I won't have any karma coming after me.

16
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:38,241
But, she cursed so vicious

17
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:40,852
Send servant to report to the Empress

18
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:42,035
and ask Empress to help

19
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:43,989
Let's not make her life any more miserable

20
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:45,798
Forgive her

21
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,951
She lost his majesty's favor, can't feel well

22
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:49,868
she'll be fine after some time

23
00:00:51,153 --> 00:00:52,604
Young mistress is so kind

24
00:00:54,612 --> 00:00:55,939
Young mistress, the tonic is ready

25
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,196
The tonic is so acid recently

26
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:09,043
Maybe Dr. Wen changed the prescription

27
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:19,776
I just got up not long ago, now I'm tired again

28
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:21,994
These days, young mistress are sleepy

29
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:23,641
Shortly after gets up, I got sleepy again

30
00:01:25,648 --> 00:01:26,819
Help me in and sleep

31
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,121
Huanbi

32
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:37,077
When did I become sleepy

33
00:01:38,577 --> 00:01:40,692
About 3 or 5 days ago, young mistress became easily sleepy

34
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,285
You almost sleep 10 to 12 hours a day

35
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:43,730
You almost sleep 10 to 12 hours a day

36
00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:45,564
The day before yesterday, when his majesty came

37
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,863
it's almost noon

38
00:01:46,863 --> 00:01:49,745
but young mistress was still in bed

39
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:52,536
There's something wrong, right?

40
00:01:53,178 --> 00:01:54,182
Young mistress, don't sleep first

41
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:55,579
I'll ask Lord Wen to come

42
00:01:58,668 --> 00:01:59,661
Don't let others know

43
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,638
You just say it's a regular check up

44
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:24,728
Young mistress, pardon me. This will hurt a bit.

45
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,453
This acupoint is called Hegu acupoint

46
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:34,142
If young mistress are just physically sleepy

47
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:36,573
the needle will not change

48
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,327
If it's due to drugs,

49
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:39,825
this needle will change color.

50
00:02:45,835 --> 00:02:46,785
Indeed someone has been

51
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:48,181
tampering with my medicine.

52
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:52,046
Young mistress, please look

53
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,128
This needle tip has a light blue-green color

54
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:57,582
What is it? Poison?

55
00:02:58,038 --> 00:02:59,176
No

56
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:01,082
In my medicine, someone added

57
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:03,133
more of an ingredient than the prescription called for.

58
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:05,006
This person was very cautious

59
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:06,683
A very small dosage was added

60
00:03:06,683 --> 00:03:09,128
so that during young mistress's regular check ups,

61
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:10,488
it would be very hard to detect.

62
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,450
But even so,

63
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,741
if this dosage is consumed for long periods of time,

64
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:18,231
young mistress will start to feel exhausted and sleepy at first.

65
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,861
In under half a year,

66
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:22,573
it will cause delirium, tantamount to dementia.

67
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:28,187
The conspirator is thinking highly of me

68
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:31,262
using such a careful way to murder me

69
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:33,401
Fortunately it was discovered early

70
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:35,741
young mistress will be fine

71
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:37,169
after some treatments

72
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,408
Clearly this person wants to subject young mistress to death

73
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:43,938
This tactic is too sinister

74
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,363
Fighting over favor in the inner palace

75
00:03:48,363 --> 00:03:50,429
has always resorted to extreme, unscrupulous measures.

76
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:52,271
It is truly impossible to guard against

77
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:54,655
If not for Lord Wen,

78
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:58,064
I would probably die in my sleep.

79
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:00,888
It is my negligence

80
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:02,763
that caused young mistress to suffer.

81
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,818
In the future, I must be extraordinarily careful

82
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:08,680
From procuring to preparing the medicine, until young mistress takes it,

83
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,568
I will do everything personally.

84
00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:12,003
I won't let anyone else intervene

85
00:04:18,278 --> 00:04:19,801
Although it's important to take precautions,

86
00:04:20,953 --> 00:04:22,164
the most urgent matter now

87
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:24,299
is to find that person

88
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:26,272
who wants to poison and harm me.

89
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,238
All the medicine is delivered here according to the prescription

90
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,447
and brewed in my palace.

91
00:04:33,582 --> 00:04:35,103
In order to put the poison inside my palace

92
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:37,285
It must be someone here

93
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,777
A month ago, young mistress's palace

94
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:42,496
got several new servant ladies and eunuchs.

95
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,198
And young mistress's medicine

96
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:47,364
just happened to have problems

97
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:48,577
after they arrived.

98
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:50,315
Seems that in this matter,

99
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:52,116
I should pay more attention to those new

100
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:54,102
servant ladies and eunuchs.

101
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,938
Young mistress, what would you like to do?

102
00:04:57,587 --> 00:04:59,243
I would like Lord Wen

103
00:04:59,243 --> 00:05:01,208
to put on a play with Huan'er.

104
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:05,220
Pretend as if nothing happened, to avoid alerting the enemy

105
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,918
I will do everything that young mistress ask

106
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:14,977
It is so kind of you, Lord Wen

107
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:18,706
Lord says I'm fine, I can now rest assured

108
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,779
Feeling drowsy and oversleeping in the spring is common

109
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:25,693
Might as well take this opportunity to get some good rest

110
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:28,078
Many thanks Lord Wen

111
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:35,488
Young mistress, servant discovered

112
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:36,607
a small hole underneath the palace walls.

113
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:39,066
It hasn't been there for long, seems a bit strange

114
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:41,266
Troubles start inside the house.

115
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:44,570
It must be made on purpose

116
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,489
Just pretend you don't know

117
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:49,095
When brewing the medicine tomorrow,

118
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:51,407
you and Xiao Yunzi stay vigilant.

119
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:53,148
catch him and physical evidence

120
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:54,370
when he is unprepared

121
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,510
Yes

122
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,181
Xiao Yunzi knows some kung fu

123
00:05:57,181 --> 00:06:00,498
he will not let the assassin escape

124
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:05,473
Respect to Empress

125
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:07,015
Respect to each Jiejie

126
00:06:07,428 --> 00:06:09,207
Stand up

127
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:11,159
Sit

128
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:13,438
Thanks, Empress

129
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,652
I'm assured

130
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:20,924
seeing Precious Shen get well

131
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:22,871
Precious Shen's falling

132
00:06:22,871 --> 00:06:24,538
is really a blessing in disguise

133
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:28,465
Gains his majesty's favour and visitations

134
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:31,751
Such a fortune is a wild wish to others

135
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:33,540
Yeah

136
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,300
Recently, I saw many people

137
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,828
around the Thousand Carps Pond

138
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:38,472
I wonded why

139
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:40,434
but I think

140
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:41,777
Maybe

141
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:44,343
they want to fall into the pond like Precious Shen

142
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:46,055
in this way, his majesty's favour would certainly come

143
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:48,313
You are good at joking

144
00:06:48,313 --> 00:06:51,003
Who will use their lives as a joke?

145
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:52,129
Right

146
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:54,875
Precious Shen has always been favoured

147
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,286
Only those old and out of favour

148
00:06:57,286 --> 00:07:01,074
will try their best to keep His Majesty

149
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:05,120
Hearing Niang niang's words, I am really scared

150
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,626
Who wouldn't one day grow old and ugly?

151
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:12,155
I'd better go to the Hall of Splendid Treasure and pray

152
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:14,221
pray to the buddha

153
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:17,899
I wish that I could stay as young and beautiful as Princess of Glory

154
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:20,127
Buddha is busy in dealing prays

155
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:21,930
have no time

156
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,173
you'd better accumulate virtue on your own

157
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:25,497
and pray yourself

158
00:07:27,107 --> 00:07:29,260
I heard that when Precious Shen was still sick in bed,

159
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,125
Precious Smiles was there waiting on you

160
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:34,247
Why isn't she here with you today?

161
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:36,347
No matter how deep one's friendship is

162
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:38,798
it cannot withstand the Emperor's favour

163
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:40,718
I heard His Majesty asked Precious Smiles

164
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:42,047
to his study room

165
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:43,782
which is why she isn't here today

166
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,612
Oh, I see

167
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:49,410
your deep friendship is merely thus

168
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:55,591
Your servant has been standing watch the whole time

169
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:57,676
while Pei'er brewed the tonic

170
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:58,862
No one else got close

171
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:13,749
It's still been poisoned.

172
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:20,398
Your servant must have slipped up

173
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:21,704
Please young mistress forgive us

174
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:23,287
it's not your fault

175
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:28,300
he can poision under your nose without being caught

176
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,945
and no one get close to it during brewing

177
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:34,670
We must be missing something.

178
00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:38,850
Huanbi, pour out the medicine later

179
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,165
and don't let others see

180
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:41,044
Yes

181
00:08:43,262 --> 00:08:44,647
What are you looking at?

182
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:46,819
I was thinking

183
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:49,564
If no one personally put the poison in,

184
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:52,828
then these things must have been tampered with.

185
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,704
Let me see

186
00:09:02,314 --> 00:09:03,920
Nothing seems wrong

187
00:09:05,832 --> 00:09:07,516
Maybe we're thinking about it the wrong way

188
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:20,843
Come take a look

189
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:23,376
Isn't the color of the lid

190
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:26,174
a bit darker than the rest of the jar?

191
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:32,425
Really!

192
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:35,070
If you don't look closely you really can't tell

193
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,116
Why is that?

194
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,119
Could it be that this jar lid

195
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:44,915
was boiled in medicine water for a long time

196
00:09:44,915 --> 00:09:47,125
and absorbed the medicine?

197
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,829
So it turned darker?

198
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:52,170
Once young mistress's medicine comes to a boil,

199
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,643
it will touch this "drugged" lid.

200
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:57,581
Then the medicine in the lid

201
00:09:57,581 --> 00:10:00,489
will mix with young mistress's medicine, without anyone knowing.

202
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:03,536
What a sophisticated method

203
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:06,108
No wonder we couldn't find anything

204
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,598
So there were preparations made in advance

205
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:15,040
Who's usually in charge of these things?

206
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,728
Originally it was me

207
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:20,428
but now they are maintained by the new servant lady Hua Sui.

208
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,943
Xiao Yunzi

209
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:23,651
Here

210
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:25,733
Dump the medicine. Then put the jar back.

211
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,093
Don't make them suspicious

212
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,389
Yes

213
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:31,750
Then check out Hua Sui's background for me

214
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,082
Yes

215
00:10:42,236 --> 00:10:43,318
Yun Gong Gong

216
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,701
Hua Sui

217
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:48,072
Why are you standing so suspiciously behind my back?

218
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,793
Yun Gong Gong, the little kitchen is not clean

219
00:10:51,793 --> 00:10:53,680
why did you personally trouble yourself to come over?

220
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,607
I am Shattered Jade Palace's Head Eunuch

221
00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:57,231
is there anywhere in this place where I cannot go?

222
00:10:57,909 --> 00:10:59,318
If I weren't to come here, I'd still be in the dark

223
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:00,857
This old medicine pot

224
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:02,562
How come you're still using it for our mistress's medicine?

225
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,828
An onlooker seeing it

226
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:05,152
would think that our mistress has lost favour!

227
00:11:05,152 --> 00:11:06,506
Go and get it changed immediately

228
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:08,787
Gong gong, you may not know this

229
00:11:08,787 --> 00:11:11,099
the tools used to brew tonics don't need to be expensive

230
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:12,565
On the contrary, ones that have been used the longest are the best

231
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:15,958
Otherwise, the medicine will lose it's potency so we shouldn't change it so easily

232
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:18,136
That's reasonable

233
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:20,342
Then keep using it for now

234
00:11:20,342 --> 00:11:21,474
Yes

235
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:23,879
Do your job well, and you will be well-rewarded

236
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,146
Yes

237
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:27,167
Right

238
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:28,463
Young mistress needs to nap after taking her medicine

239
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:29,857
Quickly prepare the medicine for tonight

240
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,102
Don't delay

241
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:32,223
Yes

242
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,281
Aiyo

243
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,764
I inquired about it

244
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:42,045
Hua Sui was previously a servant to Lady Yu

245
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:43,302
After Yushi was demoted,

246
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,044
several of her servants were sent away.

247
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:46,662
Hua Sui was among those sent away

248
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:48,165
She was then assigned to young mistress's palace

249
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:49,962
Seems like

250
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:51,516
that wench is taking revenge for Yushi!

251
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:54,896
What a loyal servant

252
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,269
Ask her in here, I have something to ask her

253
00:11:58,269 --> 00:11:59,491
Yes

254
00:12:00,477 --> 00:12:02,406
Since you're going to the kitchen, bring some pieces of hot charcoal

255
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:03,924
The kind that turns bright red when it burns

256
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,491
It will definitely be useful later

257
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,449
Huanbi Jiejie is here

258
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:16,073
Mistress' tonic is almost ready

259
00:12:16,912 --> 00:12:19,325
Not a hurry. I will stay here for a while.

260
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,877
Doctor Wen said these were the best medicines for our mistress

261
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:25,670
I've been watching it the entire time

262
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,021
Hua Sui, although you're new here,

263
00:12:30,021 --> 00:12:31,486
you're rather loyal

264
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:34,788
It's my fortune to be able to serve in Palace of Shattered Jade

265
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,170
I dare not be unloyal

266
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:37,853
Mistress knows that you're loyal

267
00:12:37,853 --> 00:12:39,271
she said she wants to reward you later

268
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:40,995
Go on in

269
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:43,021
Mistress wants to reward me?

270
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:45,633
Hurry up and go in, otherwise you'll be making her wait

271
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:49,016
In a while bring the coal burner, so that the medicine doesn't cool

272
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:49,860
Yes

273
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:55,096
Raise your head, you act like we want to eat you

274
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:01,141
Don't be scared

275
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:03,581
I just want to ask you a few things

276
00:13:04,606 --> 00:13:05,352
Yes

277
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:09,314
Jinxi says you're doing well at your work

278
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:11,403
and you're very organised and tidy

279
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,253
I'm very happy

280
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:16,023
and was wondering how I should reward you

281
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:18,343
so that the others will know that I'm fair with my rewards and punishments

282
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:19,984
and do better at their jobs

283
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:21,414
Thank you, Mistress!

284
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:23,162
I'm just doing my job

285
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:26,589
You're one of the best amongst the new batch of servants

286
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:30,133
Which palace were you from previously?

287
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:32,966
Your mistress could actually bear to let you go?

288
00:13:34,955 --> 00:13:38,057
Your servant is clumsy and lazy, I never followed a good mistress before

289
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:40,925
Working for Precious' palace

290
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:42,955
is my greatest fortune

291
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:45,924
Yu Shi has been demoted

292
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:48,534
and thus cannot be considered a good mistress

293
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:51,712
But she must have given you a lot to be thankful for

294
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:56,169
Otherwise how would you dare to commit an offense deserving death?

295
00:13:57,095 --> 00:13:59,659
Your servant did serve Mistress Yu in the past

296
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:01,106
But your servant does not know

297
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,691
what Precious is referring to

298
00:14:02,691 --> 00:14:04,130
Do you really not know what I'm talking about?

299
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:06,626
Then what's the matter with

300
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,215
the lid of my tonic-brewing pot?

301
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,020
Your servant does not know

302
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,156
I am loyal to you

303
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:13,759
Please investigate!

304
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:20,315
All right, since you say you're loyal to Precious,

305
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:22,560
we'll give you an opportunity to prove your loyalty

306
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,977
You have worked for Yu Shi before

307
00:14:23,977 --> 00:14:26,089
which is why Mistress must pay extra attention to you

308
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:28,121
If you dare to hold this coal burner in your hands

309
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:30,852
we will all believe that you're innocent and loyal

310
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:32,536
and treat you very well in future

311
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,383
Hurry up and go

312
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,221
Do you not dare to?

313
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:48,881
It looks like your loyalty to our mistress is fake!

314
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:03,548
Please spare my life, Precious

315
00:15:04,452 --> 00:15:05,685
Then tell me honestly

316
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:08,084
If there is even a hint of untruth

317
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:09,761
you'll be dragged out immediately and beaten to death

318
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,754
After I entered Palace of Shattered Jade

319
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:16,598
One day, Mistress Yu asked your servant to go over

320
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:18,891
She gave me a lot of money

321
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:21,294
and forced me to work for her

322
00:15:21,294 --> 00:15:24,761
Your servant... was foolish...

323
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:27,915
I'm begging for your forgiveness

324
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:30,009
You just keep talking about yourself

325
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:32,011
This is your chance to redeem yourself

326
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:35,587
If there are any hidden truths, I will not spare you

327
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:37,754
Mistress Yu said

328
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:40,187
your servant need not worry about anything else

329
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:44,011
as long as I put the poison in your medication and food

330
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,029
Your servant followed Mistress Yu's orders

331
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,729
and dug a hole by the wall

332
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:50,668
Whenever Mistress Yu had instructions

333
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:52,583
or wanted to bring something in

334
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,495
someone would stick a note into the hole

335
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:57,037
and all I had to do was retrieve it

336
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:59,388
Was that how the poison was brought in?

337
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:01,568
Was Mistress Yu also the one who taught you

338
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:04,078
to boil the lid of the pot in the poison?

339
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:05,058
Yes

340
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:06,158
Do you have other accomplices?

341
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:09,479
No, there's nothing else!

342
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:11,942
Then, what time does

343
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:14,250
Yu Shi put the note in the hole?

344
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:16,680
This...

345
00:16:17,824 --> 00:16:18,920
- Xiaoyunzi - I'm here

346
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,706
Force open her mouth and shove a coal inside

347
00:16:20,706 --> 00:16:22,266
I'll speak, I'll speak!

348
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,046
Every other day,

349
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:28,256
Mistress Yu will have someone place the poison in the hole

350
00:16:28,256 --> 00:16:29,927
All I have to do is retrieve it

351
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:33,860
Every other day? Isn't that tonight?

352
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:37,863
At what time do you retrieve the medicine? Are there any hidden codes?

353
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,889
At the first hour of the day

354
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:42,418
there will be two bird's calls outside the palace wall

355
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,691
Then that's that

356
00:16:43,691 --> 00:16:46,522
Your servant then replies with two bird calls

357
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,365
Have you ever seen the person who delivers the poison?

358
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:51,672
Through a wall; your servant has never seen him

359
00:16:51,672 --> 00:16:53,136
But it's a man's hand

360
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:56,616
On his right palm, he has a scar

361
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:03,483
Xiaoyunzi

362
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:05,502
lock her up in the storehouse, and don't let her commit suicide

363
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,949
If anyone asks

364
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:10,342
say I sent her to Precious Shen

365
00:17:10,342 --> 00:17:11,415
Yes

366
00:17:11,415 --> 00:17:13,196
Let's go

367
00:17:17,848 --> 00:17:22,982
Jinxi, pretend to be Hua Sui tonight and retrieve the poison

368
00:17:22,982 --> 00:17:25,265
Then get Xiaoyunzi and some strong eunuchs

369
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:26,542
to wait in ambush

370
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:28,657
Yes, I will go do that now

371
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:35,719
I have to tell Mei jiejie about today's incident

372
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:39,203
Yes, Precious Shen should know

373
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:40,533
she can contribute ideas too

374
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:43,698
What about Promise An?

375
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:45,482
Lingrong is timid

376
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,912
Don't tell her lest she gets scared

377
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:50,031
All right

378
00:17:50,031 --> 00:17:53,290
Mistress must be firm this time,

379
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,974
you cannot be forgiving

380
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:03,670
Mistress, Xiaoyunzi is up there

381
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:08,256
When the bastard turns up

382
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:09,918
he will jump down and catch the person alive

383
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:13,472
Your servant will go take a look

384
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:17,945
Xiaoyunzi knows some martial arts

385
00:18:17,945 --> 00:18:19,238
If one doesn't pay attention,

386
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:20,907
one really can't tell that he's there

387
00:18:55,652 --> 00:18:57,974
He's been caught
Xiaoyunzi, he's been caught!

388
00:18:57,974 --> 00:18:59,017
Hurry up and go!

389
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:01,165
Catch him!

390
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,162
- Walk! - Let me go

391
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:09,247
- Please let me go - Man up!

392
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,822
- Please let me go - Stop struggling

393
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,535
- I'm begging you, let me go - Kneel!

394
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:16,765
Mistress, please let me go

395
00:19:16,765 --> 00:19:19,483
Raise his head, I may know him

396
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:22,610
Xiaoyingzi?

397
00:19:23,715 --> 00:19:25,753
Ying Gong Gong, how are you?

398
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:27,631
Greetings, Precious

399
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:29,741
Although we haven't met in a long time

400
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:31,608
But we were master and servant for a while

401
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:33,939
Just answer whatever I ask you

402
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:37,819
Has the paddle been prepared?

403
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:39,536
Replying, young mistress, it's been prepared

404
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:42,775
Where are you working now?

405
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:45,649
I'm working for Official Lady Yu

406
00:19:46,183 --> 00:19:47,649
That must be hard on you

407
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,540
As a servant, I have no choice who I follow

408
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,575
there is nothing good or bad

409
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,331
You certainly look on the bright side of things

410
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:57,283
At the time, didn't you follow your Shifu

411
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:59,319
to work for Pin of Beauty?

412
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:01,141
Why are you with Official Lady Yu now?

413
00:20:01,402 --> 00:20:02,773
Shifu wanted to return to you

414
00:20:02,773 --> 00:20:04,681
and offended Pin of Beauty.

415
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:06,718
I was also dragged down with him

416
00:20:06,718 --> 00:20:09,220
Pin of Beauty let me atone for my mistake

417
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,885
by serving Official Lady Yu.

418
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:13,670
Pin of Beauty plans far ahead for you

419
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:18,806
I want to ask you, what are you doing in the middle of the night

420
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:20,663
sneaking around my palace?

421
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:22,959
This...

422
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:26,541
- Xiaoyunzi - Here

423
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:29,328
Brutally beat this back-stabbing betrayer

424
00:20:30,402 --> 00:20:32,169
Beat him until he owns up with the truth

425
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:33,021
Yes

426
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:35,645
Precious, please spare my life!

427
00:20:37,735 --> 00:20:38,343
Precious!

428
00:20:39,581 --> 00:20:41,562
Precious, please spare my life. Precious!

429
00:20:42,693 --> 00:20:44,151
Everything I've said is true!

430
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:45,948
Please spare my life!

431
00:20:52,272 --> 00:20:54,970
He couldn't take torture

432
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,870
He already confessed

433
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,637
saying Lady Yu put him up to this.

434
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,098
Tie him up. Lock him up with Hua Sui.

435
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:01,330
Watch those two closely

436
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,320
Yes

437
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:08,018
Look at this situation. How could I not be bitterly disappointed?

438
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:09,908
I treated him well in the past

439
00:21:09,908 --> 00:21:12,490
You don't need to be disappointed in this type of person

440
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,481
Now it's clear

441
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,392
It must be Yushi exacting revenge out of hatred

442
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:20,293
I have already exercised enough restraint with Yushi

443
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:22,176
But she's still forcing me step by step

444
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:26,394
Mei Jiejie, living peacefully in the palace...

445
00:21:26,394 --> 00:21:27,856
why is it so difficult?

446
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,519
Man doesn't want to hurt the lion, but the lion wants to hurt man

447
00:21:32,175 --> 00:21:34,844
You and I haven't forced anyone

448
00:21:35,505 --> 00:21:38,723
Yet they want to take our lives

449
00:21:39,526 --> 00:21:41,126
This matter

450
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:43,164
should be reported to the Emperor and Empress.

451
00:21:43,164 --> 00:21:46,336
You have all the evidence, Yu Shi can't deny it

452
00:21:46,336 --> 00:21:49,213
It's just that...if His Majesty still has any old feelings for her,

453
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:51,168
it will be difficult.

454
00:21:52,454 --> 00:21:55,620
Poison and curses haven't killed our mistress

455
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,162
She still has a reason to live

456
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,505
But the act of treason demands the perpetrator's death

457
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,895
Young mistress, do you remember your servant asking you

458
00:22:04,895 --> 00:22:06,625
on the night of new year's eve,

459
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,000
is anyone masquerading in Garden of Winter Plums?

460
00:22:16,923 --> 00:22:18,433
Niang Niang

461
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:20,028
What's so urgent?

462
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:21,941
Xiao Yinzi didn't return to Yushi's all night

463
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,108
I received news first thing in the morning

464
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,133
that after entering Palace of Shattered Jade, he never came back out.

465
00:22:26,187 --> 00:22:27,220
Incompetent idiot

466
00:22:27,784 --> 00:22:30,274
Niang Niang, eunuchs have no balls

467
00:22:30,274 --> 00:22:32,679
They can't endure any torture. He probably already confessed.

468
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,343
Yushi definitely can't be saved

469
00:22:34,343 --> 00:22:35,892
Will she rat out Niang Niang?

470
00:22:36,494 --> 00:22:37,658
What do you think?

471
00:22:38,268 --> 00:22:39,316
End things once and for all

472
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:40,961
No

473
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:42,185
If Niang niang makes your move now

474
00:22:42,185 --> 00:22:43,954
you will garner attention to yourself

475
00:22:43,954 --> 00:22:46,408
Just let Yu Shi deny everything

476
00:22:48,245 --> 00:22:50,747
She wants Zhen Huan to die for her own revenge

477
00:22:50,747 --> 00:22:54,786
But for the chance of living, why wouldn't she betray us?

478
00:22:54,786 --> 00:22:56,149
She wants to live

479
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:58,553
But what she wants more is for her whole family to live

480
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:09,007
You spoke for so long?

481
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:12,389
The meaning has to be clear, I am not eloquent

482
00:23:12,968 --> 00:23:15,123
If you are not eloquent, then few are

483
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:17,312
Things have to be said clearly

484
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,185
and it must be said in a way that moves the Emperor, right?

485
00:23:21,173 --> 00:23:22,344
Thank you, Gong Gong, for your advice

486
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:24,947
We've known each other for so many years

487
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:26,022
yet you're still doing this?

488
00:23:26,543 --> 00:23:28,336
What did His Majesty say?

489
00:23:29,192 --> 00:23:30,319
What else could he say?

490
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:33,139
Next, we'll have to rely on you

491
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:35,397
Su Pei Sheng!

492
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:43,375
Who are you? How dare you barge your way in here!

493
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:45,847
On His Majesty's orders, Yu Shi is annulled and will be thrown into the Cold Palace

494
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:50,417
I don't believe this, I don't believe this!

495
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:53,506
I want to see the Emperor!

496
00:23:53,506 --> 00:23:54,657
You want to see the Emperor?

497
00:23:54,657 --> 00:23:56,436
The Emperor does not want to see you! Move!

498
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,760
I don't believe you. I want to see the Emperor!

499
00:24:07,652 --> 00:24:11,177
I greet your Majesty, may you have good health

500
00:24:11,177 --> 00:24:12,609
Rise

501
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:13,584
Thank you, Your Majesty

502
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,675
Did you sleep well last night?

503
00:24:17,018 --> 00:24:18,374
Thank you for Your Majesty's concern

504
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,403
But I didn't sleep very well

505
00:24:22,014 --> 00:24:23,028
I know

506
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,244
Jinxi came by this morning to tell the Empress and myself

507
00:24:27,437 --> 00:24:29,768
From now on, your medicine and food

508
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,895
will be monitored carefully

509
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:34,375
This dark deed will not happen again

510
00:24:35,044 --> 00:24:38,273
It's my fault for being careless and not realising it

511
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:41,162
It's not that you did not realise it

512
00:24:41,162 --> 00:24:43,682
It's that the fighting for favour in the back palace

513
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:47,630
was something that I never expected

514
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,625
I have ordered Hua Sui and Xiaoyingzi to be killed

515
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:52,399
As for Yushi,

516
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:56,046
I have had her stripped of her title and thrown into the Cold Palace for life

517
00:24:56,046 --> 00:24:59,271
Huan Huan, you needn't be scared anymore

518
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:02,509
Huan Huan has never competed with anyone for anything

519
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:05,607
But because I unintentionally offended Yushi

520
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:07,929
so many other people's lives were implicated

521
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:12,008
Huan Huan's sins are plentiful, I have no right to receive your favour

522
00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:14,428
You're thinking too much

523
00:25:14,428 --> 00:25:19,042
You were innocently wronged and frightened

524
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:20,736
Don't cry yourself to sickness

525
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:23,889
Huan Huan prayed during the New Year's Eve

526
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:28,954
I wish. If the wind can understand my heart, 
then it shall not break me.

527
00:25:28,954 --> 00:25:29,400
(comparing herself to the winter plums)

528
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,282
But heaven does not abide by the wishes of me.

529
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,424
Where did you make this wish? And what did you wish for?

530
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,272
The night of New Year's in the Garden of Winter Plums

531
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:47,543
I hope if the wind can understand my heart, 
then it shall not break me.

532
00:25:48,946 --> 00:25:50,454
That night, the snow was slippery

533
00:25:50,454 --> 00:25:53,631
I even wet my shoes and socks

534
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,547
Then did you meet anyone?

535
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:58,407
How does Dearest 4th know?

536
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:04,048
That night, when I was in the Winter Blossom Garden,

537
00:26:04,048 --> 00:26:05,658
I ran into a male stranger

538
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,330
But because I was outside while ill,

539
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,496
and I wasn't supposed to interact with males,

540
00:26:10,496 --> 00:26:13,428
so I had to lie and say I was a palace maid in order to get away

541
00:26:18,365 --> 00:26:19,886
Don't tell me that man...

542
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:23,656
I lost my composure, I did not know it was Your Majesty

543
00:26:23,656 --> 00:26:25,355
Please punish me

544
00:26:26,214 --> 00:26:30,637
So it was you. It was actually you

545
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:34,631
I mistook someone else for you

546
00:26:35,447 --> 00:26:36,390
Su Pei Sheng!

547
00:26:37,154 --> 00:26:38,003
Your servant is here

548
00:26:38,342 --> 00:26:39,377
Send out my edict,

549
00:26:39,377 --> 00:26:42,904
Yushi of Cold Palace has committed treason and tried to poison my concubine

550
00:26:42,904 --> 00:26:44,178
She is sentenced to death (by suicide)

551
00:26:44,178 --> 00:26:46,307
Yes, your servant will do so immediately

552
00:26:48,225 --> 00:26:50,881
What's wrong, Your Majesty? Why do you suddenly want to kill Yushi?

553
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:53,144
She lied to me

554
00:26:53,436 --> 00:26:55,536
She actually claimed to be

555
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:58,522
the lady from the winter blossom garden

556
00:26:58,522 --> 00:27:00,864
and used it to gain my favour

557
00:27:00,864 --> 00:27:02,583
She's committed so many wrongs

558
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:06,462
but because of that night, I've spared her life

559
00:27:06,462 --> 00:27:08,723
Now, however, she has nothing to save her

560
00:27:09,131 --> 00:27:10,549
Yushi's many wrongs

561
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:12,803
came about because of her admiration for Your Majesty

562
00:27:12,803 --> 00:27:18,157
A ruler does not lie. Yushi's crimes are unforgivable

563
00:27:18,157 --> 00:27:20,461
But, since you have pleaded for her,

564
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:23,832
I will allow her body to be returned to her family

565
00:27:25,206 --> 00:27:26,436
Thank you, Your Majesty

566
00:27:40,511 --> 00:27:42,998
That day when you were praying in the Winter Blossom Garden,

567
00:27:46,283 --> 00:27:46,432
were you carrying any personal effects on you?

568
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:50,788
Like a satchet or a jade pendant or jewellery?

569
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,586
Those are just a girl's playthings

570
00:27:54,586 --> 00:27:58,005
If Dearest 4th likes it, Huan Huan can make another

571
00:27:59,048 --> 00:28:01,825
This matter has caused you undue stress

572
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:06,594
You should wait until you have released this burden to make it

573
00:28:06,594 --> 00:28:10,783
I'm not in a hurry; our days are still long

574
00:28:11,461 --> 00:28:14,636
I asked you over here to tell you something

575
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:16,793
The Ministerium has been ordered to build a farming field

576
00:28:16,793 --> 00:28:19,917
The Officials are all in a flurry of discussions

577
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:22,485
Some are for it, some are against it

578
00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:24,922
I was thinking, rather than let them make useless noise,

579
00:28:24,922 --> 00:28:28,762
why don't I make a trip down myself?

580
00:28:28,762 --> 00:28:31,887
It's just outside the Capital, so the trip will only take a few days

581
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:34,961
Farming fields are what the commoners rely on

582
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:36,550
Nothing else is more important

583
00:28:37,904 --> 00:28:39,011
When is Your Majesty leaving?

584
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,401
Everything has been arranged I can leave immediately

585
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:47,610
Your Majesty must be careful while you're out of the palace

586
00:28:49,502 --> 00:28:51,876
I wanted to bring Su Pei Sheng

587
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:54,833
But he's a Eunuch, it's not convenient for him to leave

588
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,519
When I was a Duke,

589
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:58,317
I used to travel on the behalf of my Father

590
00:28:58,317 --> 00:29:00,773
so I know how to take care of myself

591
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:04,014
Stay in the palace and look after your health

592
00:29:04,014 --> 00:29:06,178
Wait for me to come home

593
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,638
Has Precious Cao's matter been dealt with?

594
00:29:10,173 --> 00:29:12,101
Niang Niang, don't look she often head down

595
00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:13,700
like a puzzle. 
(puzzle means taciturn person)

596
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,358
What she says

597
00:29:15,358 --> 00:29:16,502
all are reasonable.

598
00:29:17,484 --> 00:29:19,619
She has to settle for Yu's family.

599
00:29:20,912 --> 00:29:22,143
She is careful

600
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:25,532
If she didn't have the ability to handle matters for Niang Niang,

601
00:29:25,532 --> 00:29:27,923
she wouldn't be suitable to stay by your side.

602
00:29:28,923 --> 00:29:30,158
Speaking of ability

603
00:29:30,158 --> 00:29:33,223
Back then at the Duke's residence you were more favored than her

604
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:35,355
Why is it that now, you can't compare?

605
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:40,896
Doesn't Precious Cao have a daughter?

606
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:42,318
Of course His Majesty sees her more

607
00:29:43,257 --> 00:29:47,156
Yes, even having a daughter is good

608
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:54,463
Why are both of you so glum?

609
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:00,670
I am feeling suffocated.

610
00:30:01,457 --> 00:30:02,567
What's wrong?

611
00:30:03,308 --> 00:30:05,860
I hate being ambushed

612
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,413
and I hate Hua Sui and Xiaoyingzi

613
00:30:08,413 --> 00:30:10,287
But His Majesty really ordered for them to be killed

614
00:30:10,287 --> 00:30:13,377
I don't feel good about that

615
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,223
Yeah

616
00:30:15,223 --> 00:30:18,596
I don't feel good seeing someone get killed either

617
00:30:18,596 --> 00:30:19,949
Moreover, we had overthrown one person,

618
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:21,708
don't know after that how many people are there.

619
00:30:22,664 --> 00:30:23,898
We'll deal with it one at a time

620
00:30:23,898 --> 00:30:27,127
As long as we're united, no one can harm us

621
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:29,771
Jiejie, really.

622
00:30:29,771 --> 00:30:32,220
You kept something this huge from me

623
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,218
I had to hear about it from the Empress

624
00:30:35,218 --> 00:30:36,714
that Yushi wanted to kill Jiejie

625
00:30:36,714 --> 00:30:39,365
and that she even pretended to be Jiejie in order to win His Majesty's favour

626
00:30:39,627 --> 00:30:41,684
I didn't mean to keep it from you

627
00:30:41,684 --> 00:30:44,298
But such matters are frightening

628
00:30:44,298 --> 00:30:46,131
it's best to be ignorant about it

629
00:30:46,131 --> 00:30:48,917
But I treat you like my real older sister

630
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:50,261
There is no logic in

631
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:51,754
a younger sister not knowing when her older sister is in trouble

632
00:30:52,155 --> 00:30:54,060
It's good that everything is over

633
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:57,201
As long as you're all right

634
00:30:57,201 --> 00:31:00,647
His Majesty has ordered Yushi to be killed

635
00:31:00,647 --> 00:31:04,158
Whoever wants to harm us has to die

636
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:08,731
Lingrong is usually gentle and quiet

637
00:31:08,731 --> 00:31:10,308
but she's also a person with ideas and fortitude

638
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,527
Mistress

639
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:16,447
Yushi refuses to die

640
00:31:16,447 --> 00:31:17,948
and is kicking up a big fuss in the Cold Palace

641
00:31:17,948 --> 00:31:20,861
She insists on seeing the Emperor one last time

642
00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:22,183
How can she?

643
00:31:22,183 --> 00:31:25,070
At this hour, His Majesty has probably already left the palace

644
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:27,351
Are we supposed to let her live until the Emperor returns?

645
00:31:28,355 --> 00:31:29,412
Do you report back to Empress?

646
00:31:29,412 --> 00:31:31,283
These days Empress headache.

647
00:31:31,283 --> 00:31:32,860
Can't get out of bed.

648
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,487
So she can't deal with this matter.

649
00:31:36,003 --> 00:31:37,838
Then only the Princess of Glory can handle this matter

650
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:40,221
There is no movement from the Princess of Glory at all

651
00:31:40,221 --> 00:31:42,061
She said she's not feeling well

652
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:44,418
She has been close with Yushi

653
00:31:44,418 --> 00:31:47,213
She must be avoiding the risk of being connected to her

654
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:51,353
Yushi says that she has been maligned

655
00:31:51,353 --> 00:31:53,183
She broke the poisonous wine and appears to have gone mad

656
00:31:53,183 --> 00:31:55,080
and is even cursing our mistress in the Cold Palace

657
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,117
Her words are vicious and not fit to be heard

658
00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:00,813
Let her be, protesting against death

659
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:05,235
Jiejie, it looks like it's getting late

660
00:32:05,235 --> 00:32:06,982
I'll go back first

661
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:09,670
Be careful on your way back

662
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,182
Walk slowly, sister

663
00:32:19,415 --> 00:32:22,569
Baojun, what kind of place is the Cold Palace exactly?

664
00:32:23,438 --> 00:32:26,520
That's where the anulled concubines are locked up in

665
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,717
In the past, a lot of deposed concubines

666
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:31,774
went crazy or died because

667
00:32:31,774 --> 00:32:33,553
they could not stand being locked up in there

668
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:36,292
Everyone feels that this is a place of bad luck and evil

669
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:37,500
that's why it's called the Cold Palace

670
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,539
Then does anyone normally go there?

671
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,020
What kind of place is that?

672
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,312
In the past, servants living nearby

673
00:32:43,312 --> 00:32:46,625
often saw spirits coming from there and heard crying throughout the night

674
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:47,898
It's terrifying

675
00:32:51,424 --> 00:32:52,457
I want to go take a look

676
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:01,366
Young mistress, let's not go in

677
00:33:01,366 --> 00:33:03,116
It's scary

678
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:06,957
Let go of me

679
00:33:06,957 --> 00:33:11,014
Let go of me!

680
00:33:11,014 --> 00:33:13,829
Yushi, just accept your fate

681
00:33:14,513 --> 00:33:16,098
Let go!

682
00:33:17,888 --> 00:33:19,441
Let go of me

683
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:24,907
Why has Promise An come here?

684
00:33:25,746 --> 00:33:27,745
Zhen Jiejie heard that Yushi is cursing her

685
00:33:27,745 --> 00:33:29,071
and asked me to come here and take a look

686
00:33:29,415 --> 00:33:33,250
Let go, let go of me!

687
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:38,030
What's wrong? Gong Gong's work is not done?

688
00:33:38,595 --> 00:33:39,737
Still wildly.

689
00:33:40,758 --> 00:33:43,040
Why is it you?

690
00:33:43,672 --> 00:33:44,942
Where is the Emperor?

691
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:47,178
Let go of me!

692
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,763
- Drag her away. 
- Let go of me!

693
00:33:49,763 --> 00:33:51,017
Emperor has a precious identity.

694
00:33:51,017 --> 00:33:52,379
How could he enter Cold Palace easily.

695
00:33:53,353 --> 00:33:56,828
It's all Zhen Huan's fault! That b*tch!

696
00:33:58,212 --> 00:34:02,500
Talking the Emperor into killing me!

697
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:05,169
You don't want to die so much

698
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,906
just because you want to know the reasons.

699
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,029
Then I will tell you

700
00:34:10,955 --> 00:34:13,578
You were the one who tampered with Zhen Jiejie's medicine, weren't you?

701
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:20,348
Yes, I was the one that gave the order

702
00:34:22,047 --> 00:34:23,494
If it weren't for her,

703
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:27,270
I wouldn't have lost favour with the Emperor

704
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,923
and be left in my current state!

705
00:34:29,923 --> 00:34:35,578
I want to gnaw on her bones and drink her blood

706
00:34:35,578 --> 00:34:38,145
so that that wench won't be able to be reincarnated!

707
00:34:38,145 --> 00:34:39,685
What's the use of desperate want?

708
00:34:39,685 --> 00:34:42,258
The winner takes it all. You must hurry to die.

709
00:34:43,009 --> 00:34:45,888
No, I can't die

710
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:53,264
The Emperor and I met on the New Year

711
00:34:53,264 --> 00:34:57,699
The Emperor likes to listen to me sing Kun Opera

712
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:00,254
He can't bear to let me die

713
00:35:00,897 --> 00:35:02,843
On the night of New Year's Eve in the Garden of Winter Plums

714
00:35:02,843 --> 00:35:07,474
"If the wind can understand the plums' intention , it will not break the plums"

715
00:35:07,474 --> 00:35:09,869
You took from Jiejie's favour

716
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:11,906
What grace do you have left to continue to live?

717
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:20,033
It's her. It's actually her!

718
00:35:21,547 --> 00:35:26,890
No, I can't die. I cannot die!

719
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,471
Your Majesty!

720
00:35:33,024 --> 00:35:34,937
You like to listen to me sing Kun Opera!

721
00:35:34,937 --> 00:35:36,327
Gong Gong, may I speak with you in private?

722
00:35:36,327 --> 00:35:41,398
I'll sing for you again, Your Majesty!

723
00:35:42,772 --> 00:35:44,655
Young mistress

724
00:35:44,655 --> 00:35:47,312
His majesty is vexed, and The Empress has a headache again

725
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,736
For her to continue making a fuss like this will not be tolerated

726
00:35:50,344 --> 00:35:51,775
Your Majesty!

727
00:35:52,377 --> 00:35:54,697
His Majesty granted her death by suicide

728
00:35:54,697 --> 00:35:57,989
But this crazy woman has broken the poison wine jar and ripped up the white cloth (for hanging)

729
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,383
It's practically impossible

730
00:36:00,756 --> 00:36:02,506
Hasn't Gong Gong served His Majesty for many years?

731
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:06,299
Your servant has been with the Emperor for more than 30 years

732
00:36:07,352 --> 00:36:09,978
Gonggong have worked hard and performed a valuable service

733
00:36:09,978 --> 00:36:11,619
and well-informed in the palaces

734
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:13,825
always know what his majesty wants

735
00:36:13,825 --> 00:36:16,248
At the moment, His Majesty is away from the palace

736
00:36:16,248 --> 00:36:20,048
Are you really going to wait until he returns to deal with her?

737
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:22,270
What young mistress means is...?

738
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,606
Since His Majesty granted her death by suicide,

739
00:36:24,606 --> 00:36:28,006
once she's dead, Gong Gong's task is also finished.

740
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:31,409
Who will actually investigate whether she died by suicide or by other means?

741
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:32,840
For example,

742
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,442
the concubines should be buried alive with the emperors' death

743
00:36:36,442 --> 00:36:38,091
what would you do if they don't want

744
00:36:40,388 --> 00:36:41,397
Your servant understands

745
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:45,575
Gonggong knows better than Lingrong what "the night is long and full of dreams" means

746
00:36:45,575 --> 00:36:46,869
With her dealt with,

747
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:48,974
His Majesty would have put down one burden

748
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:52,382
Understood. Your servant sends young mistress out

749
00:36:54,418 --> 00:36:59,799
Your Majesty, save me. Your Majesty!

750
00:37:02,478 --> 00:37:05,754
Zhen Huan! Even if you don't die in my hands,

751
00:37:05,754 --> 00:37:07,882
someone else will help me finish you!

752
00:37:07,882 --> 00:37:10,153
You will die a horrible death!

753
00:37:10,153 --> 00:37:12,717
At death's door, she still doesn't know to repent

754
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:14,313
Yushi will definitely die

755
00:37:14,313 --> 00:37:15,785
But why must young mistress

756
00:37:15,785 --> 00:37:17,537
come to this spooky place

757
00:37:19,157 --> 00:37:21,252
I want Jiejie to know

758
00:37:21,252 --> 00:37:23,326
that I'd do anything for her

759
00:37:24,645 --> 00:37:26,353
You never treat us eunuchs like people

760
00:37:26,353 --> 00:37:29,235
Now you fall into our hands

761
00:37:29,235 --> 00:37:31,823
Xiao Xiazi

762
00:37:31,823 --> 00:37:33,104
Here

763
00:37:33,104 --> 00:37:37,846
Before I told you to endure. This time, don't hold back.

764
00:37:50,038 --> 00:37:52,534
Don't!

765
00:37:52,534 --> 00:37:54,772
Don't!

766
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,420
I am the Emperor's woman

767
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,035
You cannot kill me!

768
00:37:58,035 --> 00:37:59,971
You cannot kill me!

769
00:38:03,851 --> 00:38:07,302
Greetings, Precious Smiles and Precious Shen

770
00:38:07,302 --> 00:38:10,569
Yushi has committed suicide

771
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,618
It's good that it's over

772
00:38:14,618 --> 00:38:16,799
a quick one

773
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:18,398
Please rest assured

774
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:19,767
Rest assured?

775
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:21,103
Yes

776
00:38:21,103 --> 00:38:23,743
Wasn't it mistress who asked Promise An to come?

777
00:38:24,531 --> 00:38:25,952
Yushi was kicking up a big fuss

778
00:38:25,952 --> 00:38:28,321
Promise An said that she'd be dead either way

779
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:30,522
which was why your servant strangled Yushi

780
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:32,473
She was strangled to death?

781
00:38:32,968 --> 00:38:34,276
Yes

782
00:38:34,276 --> 00:38:35,739
This was Promise An's idea?

783
00:38:35,739 --> 00:38:36,975
Yes

784
00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:39,506
Otherwise, even Shifu didn't think of it

785
00:38:39,506 --> 00:38:41,016
But Yushi is disliked by all

786
00:38:41,016 --> 00:38:42,326
so no one will say anything about it

787
00:38:45,395 --> 00:38:47,312
Good job, you're dismissed

788
00:38:47,312 --> 00:38:48,568
Your servant takes his leave

789
00:38:50,124 --> 00:38:52,165
Young mistress, are you alright?

790
00:38:54,722 --> 00:38:56,419
Young mistress, are you alright?

791
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:57,895
She's already dead, leave it be

792
00:38:57,895 --> 00:38:59,468
Why say such disgusting things?

793
00:38:59,468 --> 00:39:01,158
Young mistress, quickly inhale this fragrance

794
00:39:01,158 --> 00:39:03,113
to dispel your disgust.

795
00:39:04,247 --> 00:39:05,502
Greetings, Promise An

796
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:07,366
Where is Jiejie?

797
00:39:07,366 --> 00:39:09,165
She's having tea with Precious Shen inside

798
00:39:09,165 --> 00:39:11,404
I'll let her know you're here

799
00:39:11,404 --> 00:39:12,616
No need

800
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,071
I exactly want to go asking for a cup of tea.

801
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:16,426
I will go in myself

802
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:19,281
Mei Jiejie

803
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:21,869
Did I overdo it

804
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:25,191
We will not attack unless we are attacked

805
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:27,839
But I didn't think that

806
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,475
Lingrong would be so heartless in this matter.

807
00:39:31,562 --> 00:39:34,065
Lingrong did it for us

808
00:39:34,065 --> 00:39:37,139
There are too many killings in this palace

809
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:38,830
If we are not vicious to other people

810
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,205
other people will be even more vicious to you

811
00:39:41,872 --> 00:39:43,729
I know this

812
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:47,326
But this matter started because of you

813
00:39:47,326 --> 00:39:50,097
Lingrong was never implicated

814
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:54,969
But now she's gone to the Cold Palace to order Yushi to be strangled to death!

815
00:39:54,969 --> 00:39:56,912
Such an action is competely unlike

816
00:39:56,912 --> 00:39:59,092
her usual warm and gentle self

817
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:07,039
