1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,032
<i> ~ Episode 11 ~</i>

2
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:06,024
But this matter started with you

3
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:08,525
Ling Rong was never implicated in it

4
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:11,391
But now she's actually gone to the Cold Palace

5
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:13,097
to ask that someone be strangled alive

6
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:16,662
This is completely unlike her

7
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:18,178
usual gentle and warm self

8
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:20,920
A frightened rabbit can bite people

9
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,770
But this is a matter that even Su Pei Sheng didn't think to interfere with

10
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,538
yet Ling Rong was able to deal with it so efficiently

11
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:29,314
I'm too surprised

12
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:31,049
Although it's surprising,

13
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:35,382
Ling Rong did it because of us

14
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:39,552
Though that is true, but I still feel that

15
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:42,866
it's too unlike the Ling Rong that we know

16
00:00:57,293 --> 00:00:58,283
She's dead?

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,790
Utterly and completely so

18
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:01,970
When she was dragged to the burial site,

19
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,581
someone personally witnessed it

20
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:05,296
It was done very viciously,

21
00:01:05,296 --> 00:01:07,985
her neck was practically severed. It was frightening!

22
00:01:09,614 --> 00:01:11,284
Those things without their genitals

23
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:14,283
are still rather efficient in their work

24
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,877
But that's not surprising

25
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:19,739
She even dared to offend those close to the Emperor

26
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:21,783
She deserves her ending

27
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:25,551
Did she reveal anything?

28
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:26,622
Not one word

29
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:29,552
At least she was smart enough not to

30
00:01:29,552 --> 00:01:33,065
In the past, I underestimated the sickly Zhen Huan

31
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:35,892
Now, we'll see

32
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:42,722
After these stuffy past couple of days,

33
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:44,532
it's about time that it rains

34
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:54,938
Jinxi

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,953
Mistress, why aren't you sleeping?

36
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:05,780
I'm quite scared

37
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:08,623
Those myths and ghost stories

38
00:02:08,623 --> 00:02:10,478
are mere folk tales

39
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:12,405
Don't take them to heart

40
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,491
I'm not scared of ghost stories

41
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,103
I'm afraid

42
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:20,775
that although Yushi has passed on

43
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:24,669
that this matter hasn't been completely resolved

44
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:27,166
Mistress suspects

45
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,449
that someone was giving Yushi the orders?

46
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:31,662
Think about it carefully

47
00:02:31,662 --> 00:02:34,275
Yushi isn't a calculative person with deep motives

48
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,969
She was merely a palace maid

49
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:38,258
how would she know about poisons?

50
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,228
How would she know how much to put in my medicine?

51
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,731
And how would she know how to carry out the deed

52
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:44,418
by planting people both inside and outside of Palace of Shattered Jade?

53
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:46,435
Furthermore, where did she get the poison?

54
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:47,916
You're right

55
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:51,029
Mistress should have kept her alive

56
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:52,239
and interrogated her carefully

57
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:54,481
She hated me to the core

58
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:56,567
and thus wouldn't have revealed the actual perpetrator

59
00:02:57,596 --> 00:02:59,507
She might even have maligned someone else

60
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:02,647
But with her death

61
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:05,026
the person instructing her would relax

62
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:06,936
and we may use such an opportunity

63
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,349
So we should use Yushi's death

64
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:14,079
to put up a good performance?

65
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,693
Ghost!

66
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:30,341
Ghost!

67
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:33,685
Ghost!

68
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:36,356
How much longer?

69
00:03:36,356 --> 00:03:37,549
We're almost there

70
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,815
Mistress was at Precious Flower Hall praying for half the night

71
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:40,916
It's been hard on you

72
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,987
The Empress hasn't been feeling well lately

73
00:03:43,987 --> 00:03:47,085
Praying for her is my duty

74
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:55,993
Who is crying?

75
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,623
It sounds creepy. Let's go, hurry!

76
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:04,693
Ghost!

77
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:08,593
There's a ghost! A ghost!

78
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:12,850
Ghost!

79
00:04:34,284 --> 00:04:35,450
Did you really see it?

80
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:39,344
Precious sister was praying for half the night

81
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:40,462
Maybe you were seeing things?

82
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:42,682
If you don't believe me, ask Sang'er

83
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:44,510
She saw it too!

84
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,678
It's true. It had a woman's hair

85
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:49,871
and was cold and creepy

86
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,203
There was the smell of decay; the smell of a dead person

87
00:04:54,124 --> 00:04:56,855
See? Even Sang'er was scared witless

88
00:04:57,883 --> 00:04:59,963
She's the sharpest maid in my palace

89
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:01,579
Yes

90
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:05,455
I heard that a eunuch saw it too

91
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,781
and was scared to the point of sickness

92
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:09,545
I really saw it

93
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,053
She was in white and had a ghostly pale face

94
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:17,220
with a tongue this long. She was even bloodied.

95
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:19,800
Her eyes had blood too

96
00:05:21,036 --> 00:05:25,024
Her hair was a mess and she was crying and crying

97
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:27,042
She was crying so terribly

98
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,761
Perhaps she was a woman who died grievously

99
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:30,836
You usually don't say much

100
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:32,447
but now you've hit the nail on the head

101
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:35,302
If it weren't a woman who died grievously, would she be crying at night?

102
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,144
A woman who died grievously?

103
00:05:39,977 --> 00:05:44,354
It must be Yushi who died in the Cold Palace

104
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:46,142
It must be Yushi's ghost who has come to seek vengeance

105
00:05:46,677 --> 00:05:49,166
Don't talk rubbish. She was properly convicted.

106
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,065
What grievances could she have?

107
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:51,991
What do you know?

108
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:54,673
At that time she didn't want to die

109
00:05:54,673 --> 00:05:56,581
so Eunuch Su couldn't complete his job

110
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:59,906
She ended up being strangled to death

111
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:04,430
That back palace is so chaotic<br><br>Why don't we

112
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,009
wait for His Majesty to return and inform him then?

113
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:08,192
His Majesty hates ghost stories and superstitions

114
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:10,406
If you dare to, then you go and tell him

115
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:13,832
A person's grievance must go to the person who caused it <br>I didn't do anything to her!

116
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,500
Why would she come and look for me?

117
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:17,814
That's why she didn't harm you

118
00:06:17,814 --> 00:06:19,394
Didn't she leave immediately?

119
00:06:19,394 --> 00:06:21,736
Otherwise, would you still be sitting here alive?

120
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:25,149
Then who would she look for?

121
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:28,207
Anyway, it has nothing to do with Sister Smiles

122
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:33,820
I heard that after Yushi's death

123
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,572
Precious Smiles hasn't slept well

124
00:06:36,572 --> 00:06:38,161
so the physician has gone to check on her

125
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:39,348
Thank you for your concern

126
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:41,696
Physician Wen is looking after her

127
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,472
But she hasn't seen improvement

128
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:48,860
The palace has been running rampant with ghosts these past couple of days

129
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,703
More than ten people have seen it

130
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:53,257
It's hard to get a good night's rest

131
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:56,432
I heard so too. Some eunuchs have even fallen ill

132
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:59,183
Precious Fucha doesn't even dare to leave her rooms

133
00:06:59,183 --> 00:07:00,254
The Emperor has said

134
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:04,325
that ghost stories stem from people's overactive imagination

135
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:07,405
Furthermore, so many people have seen it

136
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:10,566
they're merely adding their own dimensions to the tale

137
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,001
It looks like Princess of Regularity hasn't seen His Majesty in so long

138
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,174
that she's even forgotten his words

139
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:18,822
Niang niang often hears the Emperor's words of wisdom and is therefore unafraid

140
00:07:18,822 --> 00:07:21,442
unlike us who seldom see His Majesty

141
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:24,536
If all of us have His Majesty's wisdom with us,

142
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:26,483
then the palace would naturally have less of these rumours

143
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:31,215
Unfortunately, we're not so blessed

144
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:35,024
Since you're not blessed, then you should pray for more blessings

145
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,764
Otherwise, when the grieving ghost comes upon you

146
00:07:37,764 --> 00:07:39,297
it'll be too late to pray to the gods

147
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:44,091
All of you talk about such ugly things in private,

148
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:46,467
talking about nonsensical ghosts and supernatural demons

149
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:48,182
I don't believe it

150
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:50,420
Yushi will naturally look for

151
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,250
whoever she hated while she was alive

152
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,718
Why is everyone else even feeling worried?

153
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:56,761
Niang niang's teachings are right

154
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:58,581
Yushi was not receiving orders from anyone

155
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:01,028
of course she was acting out of her own evil thoughts

156
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:03,622
If someone were instructing her behind the scenes,

157
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:06,838
she'd definitely go and haunt that person whom caused her death

158
00:08:06,838 --> 00:08:09,640
and ask that person why she had to be the scapegoat

159
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:40,353
Your Highness looks much better now

160
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,228
Today is the first day of the month

161
00:08:44,228 --> 00:08:46,137
it is my duty to make offerings to the gods

162
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:50,155
and obtain their protection. Naturally, I feel better.

163
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:52,565
Your Highness was sick for two days and may not know

164
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:57,473
but rumours are running amok in the back palace <br><br>about ghosts and the supernatural

165
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,950
Rumours should not be believed in

166
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,518
The Forbidden City has stood for hundreds of years

167
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:04,344
what kinds of supernatural tales have not been heard before?

168
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,130
If there is really a problem, then an exorcism should be arranged

169
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:09,547
Once the exorcism is performed,

170
00:09:09,547 --> 00:09:12,535
wouldn't the back palace strengthen their belief in the supernatural?

171
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:15,438
Performing an exorcism is not about belief

172
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:17,527
but to put everyone's minds at ease

173
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,241
Then get the Precious Flower Temple's priest to perform the rites

174
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,764
Performing an big exorcism

175
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:28,776
The Cold Place is so spooky

176
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,026
I'll ask the priest

177
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:33,466
to release souls from purgatory in the Cold Place

178
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:45,041
I was in a trance the days before

179
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,450
I thank Niangniang's kindness

180
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,306
for exempting me giving respects in those days.

181
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:50,524
You look much better now

182
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:53,237
Several days ago when I looked at your face

183
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:54,327
it was so pale

184
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:56,308
Thank you for Empress's concern

185
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:58,636
I should have payed respects to Niang Niang

186
00:09:58,636 --> 00:10:01,526
please forgive me

187
00:10:01,998 --> 00:10:02,956
Sit down

188
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:04,188
Thank you Niang Niang

189
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:07,181
You were not so well

190
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:09,463
if you came here everyday

191
00:10:09,463 --> 00:10:11,561
I'll be worried

192
00:10:12,785 --> 00:10:15,997
Right, it's ok for you to come in the daytime

193
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:17,650
but if at night

194
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,699
and see some ghosts

195
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:21,434
that's too bad

196
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:27,322
Your Highness, the thunder is so loud

197
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:30,079
I'm afraid that there will be a thunderstorm later

198
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:33,712
It has indeed been raining for the past two days, making it inconvenient to go out

199
00:10:33,712 --> 00:10:36,516
It's not early, all of you should return

200
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,982
We take our leave

201
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,578
Why isn't Precious Cao here today?

202
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:52,478
Princess Wen Yi caught a cold and she had to accompany her

203
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:53,815
thus she wasn't able to come out

204
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:58,838
Respectfully send off Princess of Glory

205
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:01,413
Respectfully send off Pin of Beauty

206
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:02,991
Even though Precious Smiles is feeling better,

207
00:11:02,991 --> 00:11:05,860
but I think you look very frail

208
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,424
The feeling of having nightmares keep you up must be horrible

209
00:11:09,424 --> 00:11:10,497
Niang niang, please stop

210
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:13,001
That thing is heinous, it will haunt people

211
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:15,280
You've really been scared witless

212
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,300
You even dare to spout nonsense before me

213
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:20,381
Please forgive her Princess of Glory

214
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:23,261
Jiejie is indeed frightened by the incident

215
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:25,004
It really is...

216
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:29,303
There've just been too many people who have seen it

217
00:11:29,303 --> 00:11:31,814
so it's best to be careful

218
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:34,190
Yes, exactly! I saw it myself!

219
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,256
If there really isn't a ghost with grievances

220
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:39,039
then why is the Empress arranging an exorcism?

221
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,405
That ghost is full of such anger and grief,

222
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:44,499
I wonder if the priest handling the rites will be powerful enough to exorcise her

223
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:46,294
Can a priest be unable to do so?

224
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:49,630
She died so horribly. Her grievances must be deep.

225
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:54,434
It is said while the priest climbs a foot, the devil climbs ten

226
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:56,569
I heard that His Majesty granted Yushi death by sucide

227
00:11:56,569 --> 00:11:58,780
but the concubines that were close to her

228
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,476
didn't do a single thing to plead for her

229
00:12:00,476 --> 00:12:04,125
that's why she died so horribly in the Cold Palace

230
00:12:04,676 --> 00:12:06,117
These words from the servants' mouths

231
00:12:06,117 --> 00:12:07,409
can be left alone

232
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:10,035
But from the mouths of you ladies

233
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:12,317
is a show of lack of dignity and grace

234
00:12:12,468 --> 00:12:14,439
These words should indeed not be uttered

235
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:17,432
But everyone is scared and uneasy now

236
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:19,925
I heard Precious Cao has never been a timid one

237
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:21,828
if she were here we would feel better

238
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:24,654
But why is it that Precious Cao isn't here today?

239
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:27,017
Princess Wen Yi caught a cold

240
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:28,535
Precious Cao has to look after her

241
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:30,796
That's why she isn't here to pay her respects to the Empress

242
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,606
Precious Smiles has always been a thoughtful person

243
00:12:33,606 --> 00:12:35,309
I'm sure you're thinking too much right now

244
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:37,794
Let's go

245
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:39,812
That's true, as long as our conscience is clear

246
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:41,392
we shouldn't be scared of having ghosts on our doorsteps

247
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:01,256
Hurry up, let's go

248
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:02,828
It's already so dark outside

249
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:04,559
Any later and the unclean things will start coming out

250
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,004
Yes, it's almost night

251
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:07,237
we should leave quickly

252
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:25,103
What is that?

253
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,589
What's the matter?

254
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:28,307
- What is that? <br> - What happened?

255
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:42,070
Ghost!

256
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:46,793
She came. The ghost came to get me!

257
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,176
That's Li Pin's voice

258
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:49,980
Yes

259
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,633
Jin Xi, quickly report this to the Empress

260
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:52,735
Yes

261
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:54,304
Hurry, let's go take a look

262
00:14:03,037 --> 00:14:06,265
- Ghost! <br> - It's the middle of the night

263
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:07,416
What are you crying madly about?

264
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,072
Quickly shut your mouth

265
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:11,583
Ghost!

266
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,644
She came. She came, didn't she?

267
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,748
She came, didn't she?

268
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:19,720
Whoever keeps talking nonsense will be immediately sent to the Cold Palace!

269
00:14:24,808 --> 00:14:27,040
What are you waiting for? Help her up.

270
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:32,692
It wasn't me!

271
00:14:33,362 --> 00:14:35,099
The medicine...I provided the medicine

272
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:38,051
but I didn't tell her to poison Precious Smile! It wasn't me!

273
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:39,881
Pin of Beauty has lost her mind!

274
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,227
Quickly silence her

275
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:42,569
and take her back to the Palace of Wings!

276
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:43,646
Wait!

277
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,538
Princess of Glory please reconsider

278
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,733
I'm still not sure what just happened

279
00:14:52,363 --> 00:14:53,372
I think that

280
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:54,966
Pin of Beauty should be returned to her own palace first

281
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:56,391
and the imperial physicians summoned.

282
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:58,765
Why would she go to the Palace of Wings first?

283
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:01,614
Pin of Beaulty lost her mind, shouldn't be in the public

284
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:03,844
It's more convenient to bring her back to Palace of Wings

285
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:06,428
Niang Niang is absolutely right

286
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:08,305
But things happened so suddenly

287
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:11,471
I think someone should be sent to inform the Empress first

288
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:13,400
This must be handled expediently

289
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,454
In such a condition, Pin of Beauty

290
00:15:15,454 --> 00:15:17,047
will pollute the Empress's ears.

291
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:19,304
It won't be too late to tell the Empress a bit later

292
00:15:20,513 --> 00:15:22,666
I have always helped the Empress manage the six palaces

293
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:25,617
Don't tell me I can't take this small matter into my own hands

294
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:27,711
Pin of Beaulty is a host of a palace,so it is important

295
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:29,804
Niang Niang should really inform the Empress

296
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,344
to avoid His Majesty placing blame in the future.

297
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:34,232
Although it is true, you're most favoured

298
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:36,619
you don't need to pressure me with the Emperor

299
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:38,807
You are all blocking me like this...

300
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:41,182
are you purposely giving me a hard time?

301
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:44,374
I am not trying to give Niang Niang a hard time

302
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:46,236
It's just that Pin of Beauty's words

303
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,416
touched upon the subject of my recent poisoning.

304
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,090
I have to intervene

305
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,503
What are you hesitating for? Take her back!

306
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,214
Empress arrives!

307
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:06,137
Respects to the Empress

308
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:19,100
Greetings Empress

309
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:27,490
Everyone rise

310
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:29,845
Thanks Empress

311
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:39,128
Making such a huge commotion in the inner palace...

312
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:40,970
I can't even rest!

313
00:16:42,673 --> 00:16:44,207
What happened to Li Pin?

314
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:49,231
Zhou Ning Hai! You're a servant,

315
00:16:49,231 --> 00:16:50,694
how dare you cover Li Pin's mouth!

316
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:52,843
really offensive

317
00:16:53,523 --> 00:16:54,672
Empress, you don't know

318
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:56,278
Pin of Beaulty suddenly lost her mind, and talked nonsense

319
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:58,129
So I ask the servant cover her mouth

320
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:00,503
In case her words cause troubles

321
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:02,028
But you should let go of her first

322
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:04,293
Will you take her back to Palace of Qi Xiang

323
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:05,710
with her mouth covered

324
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:13,910
- Niang Niang save me! <br>- What are you doing?

325
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,920
Niang Niang Yu Shi came

326
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,970
I didn't let her do that

327
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:18,843
Let go of Niang Niang

328
00:17:18,843 --> 00:17:20,740
Right, it's none of everyone's business

329
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,210
she did it herself

330
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,619
Don't be afraid, Yu Shi didn't come

331
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,150
go back with me

332
00:17:28,176 --> 00:17:29,080
Niang Niang

333
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,695
Yu Shi is coming, she is coming

334
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:33,089
She is coming for us to revenge

335
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:33,978
What are you talking about

336
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:38,370
Empress save me, ghost ghost

337
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,622
Nonsense, where's your manner

338
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:41,924
I can't be assured seeing you act like this

339
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:43,071
Jiang Fuhai,

340
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:43,561
Yes

341
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:44,737
Take Pin of Beaulty back to Palace of Benevolent Hope

342
00:17:44,737 --> 00:17:45,586
Empress

343
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:51,218
Pin of Beaulty probably got insane

344
00:17:51,992 --> 00:17:53,725
How can you take her to Palace of Benevolent Hope, and disturb you

345
00:17:55,147 --> 00:17:56,501
how about I take her back with me

346
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:58,170
and take care of her

347
00:17:58,473 --> 00:18:01,317
Palace of Benevolent Hope is big enough to settle her down

348
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:04,424
besides, Pin of Beauty's lost her mind

349
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:06,233
but her words

350
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:08,697
involved Yu Shi's poisioning

351
00:18:09,311 --> 00:18:11,697
This is a matter of grave importance. I have to investigate it.

352
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,362
Do you think it is inappropriate

353
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:16,803
if I take her with me

354
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:21,721
No, I don't think it is inappropriate

355
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:23,011
if Empress takes care of her

356
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,445
But his majesty commanded me to assist in managing the inner palaces himself.

357
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,075
His majesty must believe that

358
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,748
I can share Empress' burdens

359
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:33,902
I'm afraid his majesty will blame me

360
00:18:35,126 --> 00:18:36,623
for lacking show of concern.

361
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,951
Empress is the master of the inner palaces, if you deal with this yourself

362
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:48,498
his majesty must be more assured

363
00:18:51,082 --> 00:18:52,130
Respectly send Empress

364
00:18:53,874 --> 00:18:55,748
Respectly send Empress

365
00:18:56,187 --> 00:18:57,783
Jiang Fuhai, take Pin of Beaulty

366
00:18:58,246 --> 00:18:59,353
Yes

367
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:16,719
Young mistress! Two young mistresses are back.

368
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:18,352
It took you so long

369
00:19:18,352 --> 00:19:19,684
We were so worried

370
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:21,253
Xiao Yunzi

371
00:19:21,253 --> 00:19:23,166
We made you dress up like a ghost. We've troubled you.

372
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,524
There's no need to say such things to your servant

373
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:27,799
But I took a quick look at myself in the mirror

374
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,155
I even scared myself!

375
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:32,501
Of course

376
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:35,348
You really scared Pin of Beauty. She became so disoriented

377
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:36,637
and revealed quite a bit of information!

378
00:19:37,307 --> 00:19:38,755
I didn't think that my trivial skill

379
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:39,868
would come in so handy here.

380
00:19:39,868 --> 00:19:41,634
I should really thank Huanbi Jiejie

381
00:19:41,634 --> 00:19:43,268
for preparing this white clothing for me

382
00:19:43,268 --> 00:19:44,505
and Promise An

383
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:46,453
for painting this big white face on me!

384
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:49,297
That's nothing

385
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:50,528
The two Jiejies came up with this good idea

386
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,513
You thought of it first

387
00:19:52,513 --> 00:19:53,791
Huan'er and I

388
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,783
just refined the idea a bit and executed it.

389
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:57,476
Jiejie won't blame me for being vicious?

390
00:19:57,476 --> 00:19:59,633
Everything I'm doing

391
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,820
is for the goal of our peaceful existence in this palace.

392
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:03,480
How could we?

393
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,496
We're all sisters. Who would say that?

394
00:20:07,282 --> 00:20:08,660
Mei Jiejie won't blame me either?

395
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,836
You're the most meticulous

396
00:20:09,836 --> 00:20:12,182
Finding out ghosts were Pin of Beauty's greatest fear was all thanks to you

397
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,212
Alright, let's not talk about this for now

398
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:16,600
Xiao Yunzi, burn these costumes

399
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,732
If we leave traces behind things will be ruined

400
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:20,045
Yes, servant knows

401
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:30,306
Niang Niang, sit for a while

402
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:31,903
You must be tired from walking back and forth

403
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:34,941
I asked you here for half a day. You haven't said a word!

404
00:20:37,455 --> 00:20:38,720
Cry cry cry! You only know to cry!

405
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,265
What did you bring her for?!

406
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:41,486
Niang Niang, please calm down

407
00:20:41,486 --> 00:20:43,345
The princess is sick. She can't be apart from me.

408
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:45,894
Now that something big has happened,

409
00:20:45,894 --> 00:20:47,365
you're out of ideas!

410
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:51,427
Niang Niang, do you believe in this talk of ghosts?

411
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:54,586
It's precisely because Niang Niang doesn't believe it

412
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,019
that ghosts dare not attack you

413
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:59,331
But Pin of Beauty is very superstitious

414
00:20:59,331 --> 00:21:01,979
so she believes ghostly stunts pulled off by other people

415
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:03,706
ghostly stunts pulled off by other people?

416
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,474
You're saying that someone is behind all of this?

417
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,811
Otherwise, how do you explain that the ghost spirit

418
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:12,960
only dares to frighten Pin of Beauty,

419
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,234
but doesn't dare approach Niang Niang?

420
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:18,833
It's Zhen Huan! It must be her!

421
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,443
Shen Mei Zhuang doesn't have that many sinister ideas!

422
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,927
She dares to pull such tricks

423
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:28,151
I will turn her Palace of Shattered Jade upside down!

424
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:30,973
and find all of the props she used to pull the stunts off

425
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:32,229
Don't

426
00:21:32,903 --> 00:21:34,203
Niang Niang, you must not

427
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:36,078
You've already been implicated in the matter

428
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:38,731
If you pull such a big move, it will backfire

429
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:41,839
Besides, Zhen Huan must have already destroyed the evidence

430
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:42,804
It would be useless to search

431
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:44,221
Then should I just be a sitting duck?

432
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:47,481
Fortunately though, isn't Pin of Beauty already crazy?

433
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:48,981
The crazy will say anything!

434
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:55,087
Crazy?

435
00:21:58,362 --> 00:22:00,632
Their words are not credible

436
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:07,892
Their words are not credible

437
00:22:16,475 --> 00:22:18,988
Respects to Empress

438
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:20,037
Everyone rise

439
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:23,593
Thanks Empress

440
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:29,059
I called everyone here this early

441
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:30,645
to discuss what happened last night.

442
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:32,334
I want all the details

443
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:35,868
Empress Dowager arrives

444
00:22:41,536 --> 00:22:44,122
Respects to Empress Dowager

445
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:46,073
Everyone rise

446
00:22:46,338 --> 00:22:47,614
Thanks Empress

447
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:51,622
Princess of Glory came to pay her respects early in the morning. She said Pin of Beauty was not feeling well.

448
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,376
I came to take a look

449
00:22:58,449 --> 00:23:00,466
Why was Empress Dowager alerted?

450
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,530
I think it's probably because Princess of Glory is afraid of being suspected

451
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,679
so she told Empress Dowager first to clear herself of involvement.

452
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:08,265
She is bold

453
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:10,531
Empress Dowager is the Empress's close relative

454
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:12,224
Of course she'll side with the Empress

455
00:23:12,895 --> 00:23:15,256
If she's bold enough to do this, she must have some degree of confidence

456
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,179
Any degree of confidence is not enough compared to blood ties

457
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,057
The Empress has been suppressed by Princess of Glory for a long time

458
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:22,362
Empress Dowager must not be happy about that

459
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,571
Last night's affair caused such a huge commotion

460
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:28,078
Everyone's eyes must be on the Palace of Benevolent Hope

461
00:23:28,078 --> 00:23:30,211
but there seems no action

462
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,017
When I was young, I heard people say

463
00:23:33,017 --> 00:23:35,877
before the storm comes,

464
00:23:35,877 --> 00:23:38,553
The surface of the sea is always extremely peaceful

465
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:53,084
Empress Dowager listened to nonsense for a day

466
00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:54,763
and must be annoyed.

467
00:23:55,408 --> 00:23:56,829
First drink some water and rest

468
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:00,125
This novel kind of nonsense

469
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,375
I rarely get to hear.

470
00:24:03,612 --> 00:24:04,866
If the Empress Dowager has heard it then forget it

471
00:24:04,866 --> 00:24:07,554
I will have the imperial physicians treat Pin of Beauty

472
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:08,789
No need

473
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:11,304
If her deranged words are so offensive,

474
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:13,229
don't mention when she's sober.

475
00:24:14,101 --> 00:24:16,153
Have her leave the Palace of Benevolent Hope, and go to the Cold Palace

476
00:24:16,153 --> 00:24:18,231
so she doesn't desecrate your place.

477
00:24:19,182 --> 00:24:22,799
Yes, I'll assign tomorrow

478
00:24:25,168 --> 00:24:26,852
Pin of Beauty is really useless,

479
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:28,790
unable to take such a fright.

480
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:31,009
Clearly,

481
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:33,231
she has a guilty conscience.

482
00:24:34,571 --> 00:24:37,087
But Pin of Beauty said she took directions from Princess of Glory

483
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:38,415
So what if Princess of Glory told her to?

484
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:41,024
Pin of Beauty's words can only be treated as rantings of an insane person

485
00:24:42,158 --> 00:24:43,925
Empress Dowager

486
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:45,863
I know that Princess of Glory has held you down all these years

487
00:24:48,438 --> 00:24:50,170
She doesn't know to exercise restraint

488
00:24:50,784 --> 00:24:53,716
She's been arrogant ever since she entered the Duke's abode

489
00:24:53,716 --> 00:24:55,312
But the Emperor likes her

490
00:24:56,147 --> 00:24:57,912
Her older brother is also Nian Gengyao

491
00:24:57,912 --> 00:25:00,596
Now Pin of Beauty is insane

492
00:25:00,596 --> 00:25:03,669
Everyone knows not to believe the words of the insane

493
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:06,816
Yes

494
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:11,417
So, a little punishment is enough, don't be too rigorous

495
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:15,389
As to the external, you just need to say the rumors got around in the palaces

496
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:18,063
As the Empress you must be firm

497
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:19,120
only then can the rumours be put at ease

498
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,453
Then His Majesty...

499
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:23,497
When he returns, I will tell him

500
00:25:24,712 --> 00:25:27,769
It was you who handled the six palaces, and quelled the rumors

501
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,502
As for Precious Smile, she's very intelligent

502
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:34,844
Precious Shen is also steady and calm

503
00:25:35,971 --> 00:25:37,038
Some things

504
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:39,661
you can let Precious Shen practice handling.

505
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,296
Yes, they're all picked up by his majesty and Empress Dowager

506
00:25:43,296 --> 00:25:44,774
Yes, they're all picked up by his majesty and Empress Dowager

507
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,323
Then deliver my order

508
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:50,541
Princess of Glory should have a rest

509
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,528
and not assist in managing the Inner Places

510
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,535
Yes

511
00:26:05,636 --> 00:26:06,661
Huan Bi

512
00:26:08,132 --> 00:26:09,515
Why are you here?

513
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,294
Respect to mistress An

514
00:26:11,294 --> 00:26:13,336
My young mistress ask me to bring some joss sticks and candles

515
00:26:13,336 --> 00:26:15,174
and burn the drawn buddhist sutras by the way

516
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:19,147
Why does Jiejie suddenly want to burn the buddhist sutras

517
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,068
Young mistress say there are too many bad things in the palaces recently

518
00:26:22,068 --> 00:26:23,649
so she asked me to burn the Buddhist sutras to pray for peace

519
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,870
Besides, Yushi died

520
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,454
she was only bad when she was alive

521
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:29,894
young mistress also asked to burn some for her, wishing she'll be excused from death earlier

522
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:33,226
It's late

523
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:34,579
servant will go

524
00:26:35,351 --> 00:26:36,304
Sure

525
00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:41,288
Young mistress

526
00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:42,867
what's wrong, young mistress

527
00:26:44,363 --> 00:26:46,369
Jiejie asked Huan Bi to burn the Buddhist sutras for Yushi

528
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,007
she may blame me for what I've done to Yushi

529
00:26:49,577 --> 00:26:50,561
No

530
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:53,155
Precious Wan is involved

531
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:55,068
she can't blame you

532
00:26:55,068 --> 00:26:56,826
Young mistress, don't think too much

533
00:26:58,476 --> 00:26:59,469
Let's go

534
00:27:01,572 --> 00:27:03,057
Emperor arrives

535
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,645
Your Majesty

536
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:07,825
Quickly get up

537
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:09,713
Your Majesty, you're finally back

538
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:10,884
Sit

539
00:27:14,713 --> 00:27:15,577
Miss me?

540
00:27:16,827 --> 00:27:17,858
I miss Your Majesty

541
00:27:17,858 --> 00:27:20,434
You must be very tired for your inspection tour?

542
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:22,823
I just went to see the Empress Dowager

543
00:27:22,823 --> 00:27:25,100
The poisoning incident has ended

544
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,945
You can now rest assured. I can also sigh in relief.

545
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,935
Since the incident is already over, Your Majesty need not be angry about it anymore

546
00:27:31,935 --> 00:27:35,102
Pin of Beauty only resents me

547
00:27:35,102 --> 00:27:36,933
because she cares about Your Majesty.

548
00:27:37,911 --> 00:27:38,990
Cares about me?

549
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,586
Does she care about me or her own glory?

550
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:43,345
Only she really knows

551
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:45,709
Even if she really cares about me,

552
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:47,928
doing something so sinister

553
00:27:47,928 --> 00:27:50,097
is absolutely unforgiveable.

554
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:52,694
Pin of Beauty made a mistake. She has already been punished.

555
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,172
Although Princess of Glory

556
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:57,030
usually hangs around Pin of Beauty,

557
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,729
she wouldn't be so stupid

558
00:28:00,729 --> 00:28:02,257
as to be complicit in this matter.

559
00:28:02,257 --> 00:28:06,596
Princess of Glory is blessed and has a resolute mind

560
00:28:06,983 --> 00:28:09,810
Resolute? What do you mean by resolute?

561
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:13,692
Doing things with resolve and firmness, knows how to handle matters and people

562
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,924
That is what being resolute means

563
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:17,133
Princess of Glory assists in managing the inner palace

564
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:19,278
She should be worthy of these two words

565
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:21,336
Everything has two sides

566
00:28:22,248 --> 00:28:24,394
Empress Dowager has always used proper judgment in handling affairs

567
00:28:24,394 --> 00:28:26,628
She never meddles in matters of the inner palace

568
00:28:26,628 --> 00:28:28,507
But if she gets involved,

569
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,903
it must be something major that she cannot tolerate.

570
00:28:31,894 --> 00:28:35,304
This time around, it is a warning to the back palace

571
00:28:35,304 --> 00:28:37,834
not to cause such pandemonium again

572
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:42,855
I just hope that from now on, everyone in the inner palace

573
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:45,272
can be more considerate of each other, and not so resentful.

574
00:28:45,272 --> 00:28:48,053
Only that way can Your Majesty concentrate on affairs of state

575
00:28:48,053 --> 00:28:49,305
without fear of trouble back home.

576
00:28:55,536 --> 00:28:58,292
This morning at court I saw your father cough a bit

577
00:28:58,292 --> 00:28:59,977
He seems to have caught a cold

578
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:02,466
Father has always had laryngitis

579
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:04,485
I'm also very worried

580
00:29:05,365 --> 00:29:06,737
So after court,

581
00:29:06,737 --> 00:29:08,150
I had Su Pei Sheng

582
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,650
get two bottles of honey loquat syrup for your father.

583
00:29:12,034 --> 00:29:12,972
Many thanks Your Majesty

584
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:17,585
He's your father. I should show care for him.

585
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,216
Father's laryngitis

586
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:23,746
is something that mother worries about everyday.

587
00:29:23,746 --> 00:29:25,921
She cooks almond lily in the spring

588
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:27,768
and Sichuan fritillary bulb and pears in the Autumn

589
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:29,694
she has taken care of him for many years

590
00:29:31,197 --> 00:29:32,741
Your parents care deeply for each other

591
00:29:34,028 --> 00:29:37,228
which is why their daughter is so gentle and affectionate.

592
00:29:38,712 --> 00:29:40,073
Your Majesty jokes with me

593
00:29:44,587 --> 00:29:48,468
Mother, today is your death anniversary

594
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:52,542
I don't know whether dad still remembers this or not

595
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:55,455
whether just as me

596
00:29:57,364 --> 00:29:59,410
I can only burn the ghost money for you secretly

597
00:30:01,772 --> 00:30:02,841
Mother

598
00:30:02,841 --> 00:30:04,649
daughter is unfilial

599
00:30:06,402 --> 00:30:08,527
I don't know

600
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:11,533
when I can stand out among people

601
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:16,332
and burn the ghost money for you aboveboard

602
00:30:26,268 --> 00:30:27,784
So late, who is still there

603
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:39,233
How dare you

604
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:41,718
how dare you burn the ghost money in the Royal Palaces

605
00:30:42,587 --> 00:30:43,423
Precious Cao

606
00:30:44,324 --> 00:30:46,774
You, you are Precious Smile's maid?

607
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:50,852
You know

608
00:30:50,852 --> 00:30:53,661
the ominous thing is forbiden in the palaces

609
00:30:53,661 --> 00:30:55,578
Burning ghost money is even more serious

610
00:30:56,368 --> 00:30:59,006
Precious Smile couldn't save you even if she knows

611
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,566
Forgive me Precious Cao, servant will never do it again

612
00:31:01,566 --> 00:31:03,595
please don't tell young mistress

613
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:05,715
Alright, stand up

614
00:31:06,242 --> 00:31:07,314
Please forgive me

615
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,382
You're lucky that I was the one who found you.

616
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,293
if it was anyone else

617
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:14,724
they would take you to Bureau of Cautious Punishment already

618
00:31:15,852 --> 00:31:16,824
tell me the truth

619
00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:18,335
why you burned it here

620
00:31:20,284 --> 00:31:21,648
Today is my mother's death anniversary

621
00:31:24,476 --> 00:31:25,873
You are filial

622
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:28,407
but since you are doing it for your mother

623
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:30,748
Why did you burn it here

624
00:31:30,748 --> 00:31:32,028
instead of in Palace of Shattered Jade

625
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:34,104
Servant dare not

626
00:31:34,338 --> 00:31:35,691
You are most loved

627
00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:37,304
by your Precious Smile

628
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:39,232
even your food and clothes are different from others

629
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:43,574
why didn't she help you with your filial piety

630
00:31:47,678 --> 00:31:49,641
Servant was afraid of offending young mistress

631
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:53,386
please don't tell young mistress

632
00:31:53,386 --> 00:31:55,136
about what happened today

633
00:31:55,943 --> 00:31:56,984
I know

634
00:31:58,212 --> 00:31:59,707
sweep away all the ashes quickly

635
00:31:59,707 --> 00:32:02,333
they will catch you if they find the ashes

636
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:04,314
Thank Precious

637
00:32:11,854 --> 00:32:14,166
Precious Flower Hall's priest has done four rites

638
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:17,251
total expenses on joss sticks and candles is 1800 taels

639
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:19,285
It's getting hot

640
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:21,905
Every maid and eunuch in the palaces

641
00:32:21,905 --> 00:32:24,251
have been given green bean soup at lunch to clear their heat

642
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:27,692
This costs 32 taels per day

643
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:29,466
Wait

644
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,754
One day's green bean soup is 32 taels?

645
00:32:32,754 --> 00:32:34,646
Then what about a month's worth?

646
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:41,938
960 taels

647
00:32:43,112 --> 00:32:46,422
Wealth comes from the simple places. <br><br>Although it's just one bowl of green bean soup

648
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,526
but carried out over a long period of time,

649
00:32:48,526 --> 00:32:50,199
it's no small sum

650
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:51,774
Empress is right

651
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,943
But this has been going on since the previous Emperor's reign

652
00:32:57,924 --> 00:32:59,244
If it was suddenly discontinued,

653
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:02,623
I'm afraid that there will be grumblings

654
00:33:03,526 --> 00:33:04,789
His Majesty is right

655
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:06,316
Acts of benevolence from the masters

656
00:33:06,316 --> 00:33:08,528
encourage the servants to do their jobs to the best of their abilities

657
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,910
So this sum of money is not something we should scrimp on

658
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:13,615
Precious Smiles, what do you think?

659
00:33:14,882 --> 00:33:15,984
I don't understand these things

660
00:33:16,778 --> 00:33:18,226
Mei Jiejie is doing the accounts

661
00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:20,414
So I can only drink my tea

662
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:23,082
That is the most fortunate lifestyle to have

663
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:26,662
Your Majesty, I was thinking

664
00:33:26,662 --> 00:33:29,930
that the daily stipend of each palace is never used up

665
00:33:30,618 --> 00:33:32,673
For example, for Precious ladies

666
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:35,591
they are given 1 sheng and 2 he of rice evey day

667
00:33:35,591 --> 00:33:38,318
6 jin of pork, and 6 jin of fresh vegetables

668
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:41,939
2 jin of white noodles, 1 jin and 8 liang of tofu...

669
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:44,321
No matter how they eat, they will never finish eating such large amounts

670
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:47,253
Not to mention the amount of food delivered to the Pin ladies and the Princesses

671
00:33:47,253 --> 00:33:50,473
I was thinking, why don't we

672
00:33:50,473 --> 00:33:53,229
cut down on the amount of food in exchange for silver for each palace

673
00:33:53,229 --> 00:33:55,303
Then the green bean and ice candy cases

674
00:33:55,303 --> 00:33:58,231
can also be stopped in exchange for money given to the servants

675
00:33:58,231 --> 00:34:00,430
On one hand, we save on money spent,

676
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,590
on the other, everyone gets a share

677
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,562
So that there won't be any cases of

678
00:34:05,562 --> 00:34:08,262
quibbles over someone eating someone else's share and breeding discontent

679
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,028
Jiejie is bright and intelligent

680
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:11,878
If it were me,

681
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:13,637
I would never be able to calculate all of that

682
00:34:15,211 --> 00:34:16,300
I have a headache now

683
00:34:16,963 --> 00:34:19,899
Thank goodness Precious Shen is around to do the calculations

684
00:34:20,497 --> 00:34:21,941
What do I know?

685
00:34:21,941 --> 00:34:24,418
If it weren't for the Empress' pointers and teachings,

686
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:27,258
I would have become the laughingstock of many by now

687
00:34:28,212 --> 00:34:31,290
You're still young, you should practice more

688
00:34:32,351 --> 00:34:37,107
But even practicing will be useless without some kind of natural talent

689
00:34:38,394 --> 00:34:41,591
You must be referring to me then, as someone naturally stupid

690
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,678
Look at her mouth

691
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:46,526
She still calls herself stupid

692
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:48,977
Then everyone else must be worse off

693
00:34:49,457 --> 00:34:51,730
In my opinion, Your Majesty cannot blame Meimei

694
00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:54,253
Your Majesty should blame yourself

695
00:34:54,253 --> 00:34:55,845
for having spoilt Meimei's mouth

696
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:59,312
to the point that it will say whatever it wishes to say

697
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:14,334
Your servant respectfully greets Princess of Glory

698
00:35:14,334 --> 00:35:15,137
Rise

699
00:35:15,687 --> 00:35:16,464
Thank you, Niang Niang

700
00:35:17,095 --> 00:35:19,898
Go and inform the Empress that I am here to pay my respects

701
00:35:21,426 --> 00:35:24,622
What's wrong? You aren't even going to listen to Niang niang's orders?

702
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,696
Then you don't have to inform her. I'll just go in myself.

703
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:32,084
Niang Niang. The Empress' illness is acting up

704
00:35:32,084 --> 00:35:33,267
She's ill-disposed to entertain guests

705
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,084
It's precisely because her illness is acting up

706
00:35:36,084 --> 00:35:37,618
that I am here to pay my respects

707
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:45,231
Niang Niang's illness is acting up, but her spirits seem to be high

708
00:35:45,941 --> 00:35:48,034
His Majesty has come to visit Niang Niang

709
00:35:48,674 --> 00:35:51,315
That's good. Then I'll pay my respects to the Emperor at the same time

710
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:53,903
That will save me a trip to the Palace of Resting Soul

711
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:55,715
Niang Niang be at peace,

712
00:35:56,866 --> 00:35:59,856
whether or not the Empress is ill-disposed,

713
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:01,022
is inconsequential

714
00:36:01,022 --> 00:36:03,822
The important point is whether the Emperor, upon seeing Niang Niang

715
00:36:03,822 --> 00:36:06,645
will get angry and affect his health

716
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,707
Niang Niang is an intelligent person

717
00:36:08,707 --> 00:36:11,482
and thus naturally knows how important the Emperor's regard is

718
00:36:11,482 --> 00:36:14,651
Why do you want to anger the Emperor?

719
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:25,814
Respectfully sends off Niang Niang

720
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:38,122
Reporting to Niang Niang, Precious Cao is here

721
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,008
Greetings, Niang Niang

722
00:36:52,373 --> 00:36:55,696
In this summer's heat, it's unsurprising that Niang Niang has fire in her heart

723
00:36:55,696 --> 00:36:57,563
As long as that fire can be dispelled,

724
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:59,449
I am willing to accept all consequences

725
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:01,827
Back then you were merely a

726
00:37:01,827 --> 00:37:03,228
poor concubine candidate

727
00:37:03,886 --> 00:37:05,357
Your nameplate was saved and sent to the Duke's abode

728
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,672
You never even got to see the Emperor

729
00:37:07,337 --> 00:37:09,414
If it weren't for me who suggested that you serve the Emperor,

730
00:37:09,414 --> 00:37:12,013
would you have the opportunity to give birth to the princess and become a Precious?

731
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,497
Now that Pin of Beauty and myself are in trouble,

732
00:37:15,497 --> 00:37:18,001
you come up with foul ideas and mess up everything

733
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:20,514
Yet you have the cheek to say such things before me?

734
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:22,824
I am not sure what I did wrong

735
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,471
Please tell me

736
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:26,145
I will make amends for it

737
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,785
I listened to you

738
00:37:29,771 --> 00:37:32,240
and informed the Empress Dowager about Pin of Beauty's madness

739
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,165
so that I will not be implicated

740
00:37:35,092 --> 00:37:36,853
It's fine if Pin of Beauty is sent to the Cold Palace

741
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:39,682
but I've lost the power to manage the six palaces

742
00:37:40,747 --> 00:37:42,597
All because you thought you were all that

743
00:37:42,597 --> 00:37:43,818
and came up with that plan

744
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,258
Congratulations, Niang Niang

745
00:37:50,243 --> 00:37:53,540
Tell me why I should be congratulated

746
00:37:54,516 --> 00:37:57,270
No matter what Pin of Beauty says, it is only a madwoman's words

747
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,396
No matter how suspicious the Empress Dowager and Emperor are,

748
00:37:59,396 --> 00:38:00,825
they have no evidence to back it up

749
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:02,928
Although you appear to have lost power,

750
00:38:02,928 --> 00:38:04,426
Niang Niang is able to be safe

751
00:38:04,426 --> 00:38:08,492
Furthermore, the Emperor is a sentimental man

752
00:38:08,492 --> 00:38:11,529
gaining and losing power is entirely within a single thought

753
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:12,912
You certainly make it sound easy

754
00:38:13,956 --> 00:38:15,832
Now Precious Smiles has wormed her way into the Emperor's heart

755
00:38:15,832 --> 00:38:18,474
The Empress' manipulations are also at work

756
00:38:18,474 --> 00:38:22,175
Now it's so difficult for me to even see the Emperor!

757
00:38:22,722 --> 00:38:23,916
Niang Niang is virtuous

758
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:26,934
I am willing to do anything for Niang Niang

759
00:38:26,934 --> 00:38:28,058
and provide any advice

760
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:29,160
What makes you fit?

761
00:38:31,588 --> 00:38:33,048
The Emperor is an affectionate and sentimental man

762
00:38:33,048 --> 00:38:35,403
He dotes on Wen Yi very much

763
00:38:44,295 --> 00:38:46,109
Get up <br><br> Get her a seat

764
00:38:46,682 --> 00:38:48,006
Thank you, Niang Niang

765
00:38:55,814 --> 00:38:58,522
Pin of Beauty is like an embroidered flower - Good to look at, but not very useful

766
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:01,837
It looks like you're a lot better

767
00:39:02,495 --> 00:39:04,296
You have a daughter to rely on

768
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:08,630
Unlike me who has no children

769
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:11,686
I am useless, without Niang Niang's protection,

770
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:13,536
how can my Princess grow up peacefully?

771
00:39:13,536 --> 00:39:15,830
Niang Niang has always doted on Wen Yi

772
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,490
When Wen Yi is older,

773
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,921
she will look to you as her mother and be filial to you

774
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:21,365
Look at you

775
00:39:21,365 --> 00:39:23,775
your hair is a mess yet you're still talking to me

776
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:25,992
It's been hard on you

777
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:27,614
Song Zhi

778
00:39:27,614 --> 00:39:28,317
Yes

779
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:30,448
Bring Precious Cao to the back to comb her hair and change her clothes

780
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,167
Yes

781
00:39:33,685 --> 00:39:35,258
Thank you, Niang Niang

782
00:39:35,732 --> 00:39:38,185
The Emperor hasn't seen Wen Yi for a couple of days, right?

783
00:39:38,968 --> 00:39:42,769
Bring Wen Yi to Palace of Benevolent Hope to pay her respects to the Emperor

784
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:46,565
Yes <br><br>Except that I am not good with words

785
00:39:46,565 --> 00:39:48,576
and I'm afraid that I'll annoy the Emperor

786
00:39:49,238 --> 00:39:51,074
It's all right if you're not good with words

787
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,935
It's enough that Wen Yi knows how to garner his attention

788
00:39:55,028 --> 00:39:56,101
At my dressing table,

789
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:58,279
there is a phoenix wears herbaceous peony of step-shake

790
00:39:58,279 --> 00:39:59,060
(Step-shake: Dangling ornament worn by women)

791
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,103
Wear it

792
00:40:03,213 --> 00:40:07,511
<i>Thank you for watching! <br><i>Please join us!
