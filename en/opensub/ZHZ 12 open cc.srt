<i> ~ Episode 12 ~</i>

2
00:00:04,102 --> 00:00:06,109
Reporting to Your Majesties,

3
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:08,836
Precious Cao has brought Princess Wen Yi here to pay her respects

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,830
She's brought the princess out on such a hot day?

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,323
Hurry and invite her in lest she falls ill

6
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:14,366
Yes

7
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,732
Greetings, Your Majesties

8
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:32,861
At this time, the sun is high

9
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:36,635
why are you bringing the princess around with you?

10
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:38,818
You're all right, but can she take it?

11
00:00:38,818 --> 00:00:40,117
Your Majesty is right

12
00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:43,271
But the princess has been crying since the morning

13
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:45,815
I thought it was because she hasn't seen the Empress in some time

14
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:47,538
and was missing her

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,990
Forget it. I haven't seen the princess in some time either

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,804
Come, let me carry her

17
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:05,254
I haven't seen her in a few days, but why does the princess feel lighter than before?

18
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:07,846
The weather is hot, the princess' appetite has waned

19
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:08,899
and has thus lost some weight

20
00:01:10,314 --> 00:01:12,723
Wen Yi is young and afraid of the heat

21
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:15,732
I'm afraid the concubines won't be able to stand it either

22
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:17,564
The weather's too hot

23
00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:20,003
Why don't we go to the Yuan Ming Gardens to escape the heat?

24
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:21,905
The Yuan Ming Gardens have been kept ready

25
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:23,535
Your Majesty may go anytime you wish to

26
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,969
I want to go there and stay for a couple of days

27
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:28,180
Because of my Father's funeral matters

28
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,605
I haven't been there for two years

29
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,762
Going there is easy

30
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:34,096
But the concubines who can follow are not many

31
00:01:34,096 --> 00:01:36,216
Which ones do you want to go?

32
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:39,870
Needless to say, these two are included

33
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,458
the mothers of my children will necessarily follow as well

34
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:44,865
so that it will be convenient for them to look after the children

35
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:48,133
Aside from them, ask Pin of Respects and that will be all

36
00:01:48,786 --> 00:01:50,497
Princess Duan's health is the weakest

37
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:53,080
I'm afraid it won't be easy for her to recuperate in the palace

38
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,041
She should come along too

39
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,106
But of course

40
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:57,741
As for Princess of Glory...

41
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:00,108
Why don't we let her stay

42
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:02,012
to look after the rest of the concubines in the Forbidden City?

43
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,323
This step-shake

44
00:02:05,323 --> 00:02:09,562
I gave it to Princess of Glory

45
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,251
Yes

46
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:13,389
Every time Princess of Glory wears it

47
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:14,718
the princess will smile

48
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:18,599
so Princess of Glory gave it to me for the princess to play with

49
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,163
Princess of Glory shall go too

50
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:24,955
Yes

51
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:32,628
Who arranged this? So considerate

52
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:35,718
His Majesty knows that young mistress likes aroma

53
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:38,089
to avoid heat, burning incense is not proper

54
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:41,532
His Majesty ordered us to go and get some fresh flowers

55
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,015
and use the fans to spread the scent

56
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:51,081
It really does smell nice and feel cool!!!

57
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:53,818
it is not like this in the other young concubines' rooms

58
00:04:53,818 --> 00:04:55,912
you are the only one who has this

59
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,043
this strategy is really good

60
00:04:58,043 --> 00:04:59,861
his majesty really did work hard with his heart

61
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,653
the weather is not hot yet

62
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:03,195
when the hot weather comes,

63
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:06,026
we will put ice in here

64
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:08,136
then it would be luxurious in here!

65
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:11,217
his majesty ordered us to do this early in the morning

66
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:14,325
the minute young mistress feels hot, we will immediately bring out the ice.

67
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:16,710
we don't dare disobey his majesty's orders

68
00:05:17,856 --> 00:05:18,784
you've worked hard huang gong gong

69
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:21,931
please go and inform his majesty,

70
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:23,854
that later, I will go and say "thank you"

71
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:26,521
Servant is unqualified with young mistress' appreciate

72
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:28,414
but his majesty will go and practice his archery skills,

73
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:30,514
but his majesty will go and practice his archery skills,

74
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:33,233
rest a bit young mistress, then go there later.

75
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:36,677
playing archery now? who is with his majesty right now?

76
00:05:37,157 --> 00:05:39,245
prince guo and precious cao

77
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:40,337
precious cao?

78
00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:41,267
yes

79
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:42,849
Princess Wen Yi has just gotten back to health so his majesty...

80
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:45,283
wants to see Precious Cao.

81
00:05:49,731 --> 00:05:51,299
I heard that His Majesty likes Yuan Min Yuan.

82
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:53,279
This is my first time to come here.

83
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,155
Oh yeah, young mistress,

84
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:55,659
I heard that Concubine Duan has come too.

85
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,594
we don't even know what Concubine Duan looks like.

86
00:05:58,053 --> 00:05:59,474
Concubine Duan has been sick for years

87
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:01,683
It's been a long time since she has traveled with His Majesty.

88
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,222
what is this!!!!!!?????

89
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:10,841
very good archery

90
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,904
This is JIng Xi's wild pigeon.

91
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:14,678
It's famous for dexterous and nimble.

92
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:16,464
It is very hard to aim for one and succed in shooting it.

93
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:18,378
This person's archery skills are very precise.

94
00:06:19,674 --> 00:06:20,825
Greetings Precious Wan

95
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:23,190
Is His Majesty in the garden practicing his archery?

96
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,265
Duke Guo came.

97
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:26,401
His Majesty and Duke Guo have worked together to shoot wild pigeons.

98
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,028
The real Duke Guo has finally come.

99
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:31,305
I heard from Liu Zhu that

100
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:34,171
that day when his majesty and young mistress met,

101
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:36,939
His Majesty has said to be Duke Guo

102
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,688
now the name has returned to its real owner.

103
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,426
His Majesty's archery is very precise.

104
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:42,208
Duke Guo's archery skills are so good,

105
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,580
that even His Majesty praises him.

106
00:06:44,508 --> 00:06:46,727
It is said that Duke Guo is talented in literacy and art,

107
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:48,688
I never knew that his archery skills are good too.

108
00:06:48,688 --> 00:06:49,919
you don't know

109
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,956
Duke Guo is talented in many things.

110
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:55,041
Xiao Xia Zhi, quicky bring this wild pigeon to His Majesty

111
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,229
Also go tell His Majesty on my behalf,

112
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,458
that I will go and say my greetings later.

113
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:00,571
I shall take my leave.

114
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,793
I remember,

115
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:07,793
your archery skills, were taught by our Imperial Father.

116
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:10,574
Imperial Brothers archery skills were taught by

117
00:07:10,574 --> 00:07:12,187
Man Zhou's best archery master.

118
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:13,821
I am not smart enough.

119
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:15,970
Even though I was taught by our Imperial Father,

120
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,131
I still could not master our Imperial Father's exact archery skills.

121
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:20,836
My teacher taught me archery skills,

122
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:24,969
but what Imperial Father taught was father to son education.

123
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:29,345
Imperial Father really did dote you.

124
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,052
(Chinese Idiom) When God is about to place a great responsibility on a great man

125
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:35,406
(Chinese Idiom) it always first frustrates his spirit and will

126
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:37,665
Because Imperial Father spoiled me,

127
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,978
I became a useless person.

128
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:51,687
You've become tired today. Rest early.

129
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:53,516
I shall go back to Qing Zhen palace.

130
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:56,374
His Majesty takes his leave!!!

131
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:58,108
Respectly send your majesty

132
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:10,353
Greeting Your Majesty,

133
00:08:10,353 --> 00:08:11,709
you arrived.

134
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:17,295
Duke Guo,

135
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:21,170
journeyed far away, and came back with this tea green-above-snow

136
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,893
it really is good tea.

137
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:25,219
come and enjoy it with me.

138
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:27,728
Your Majesty is in a good mood today.

139
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,943
I heard this tea is only grown in rare parts of a snow mountain.

140
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:34,287
it is very hard to get.

141
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:36,444
There are only about ten tea trees in the world

142
00:08:36,444 --> 00:08:38,810
Because of the snow-broth's nourishing

143
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,987
it tasts cool, superior

144
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,723
Duke Guo has really worked hard.

145
00:08:43,443 --> 00:08:44,279
Xiao Xia Zhi.

146
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,318
yes.

147
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:48,121
Set aside the other factors

148
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:50,531
now that the weather is warm,

149
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,867
bringing this teas back is very hard.

150
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,872
it is his intention that worth

151
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:57,450
Your majesty said just now

152
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,507
it is fine for this time

153
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:02,587
If every year this happens then it would cost too much

154
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:06,481
Duke is thoughtful, and your majesty has perspective

155
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,553
Precious Smile

156
00:09:08,553 --> 00:09:10,818
this sentence is just on the point

157
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:17,978
I heard that today His Majesty was very successful in playing archery with Duke Guo today.

158
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:20,597
how come now I don't see the Duke now?

159
00:09:20,906 --> 00:09:23,458
maybe he heard that Precious Wan your beauty is like a fairy's,

160
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,164
so he run away to avoid arousing suspicion

161
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:27,657
Precious Cao has oversaid my beauty.

162
00:09:27,657 --> 00:09:30,774
Your Majesty doesn't to to worry much about the duke.

163
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:33,685
It must be that duke heard I was ugly

164
00:09:33,685 --> 00:09:36,264
so he hid to avoid me.

165
00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:40,658
Listen, if she was ugly

166
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:44,622
the others in the Inner Place

167
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:47,076
would be more ugly

168
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:51,090
Precious Wan is humble. Your majesty don't listen to her joking

169
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:53,728
now try this Green above Snow

170
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:03,438
It really is good tea.

171
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:06,589
the scent is great and energizing.

172
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,559
Duke is certainly thoughtful

173
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:12,601
I have heard that, the day your majesty and Precious Wan met,

174
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:14,580
your majesty thought Precious Wan would be frightened,

175
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,551
so your majesty used Duke Guo's name as his own,

176
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:18,155
and played music along with Precious Wan.

177
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:20,067
That was what caused today's relationship

178
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:22,197
it really is a nice story.

179
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,077
Precious Cao even knows this story,

180
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:28,120
then his majesty must have told you himself.

181
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:30,254
I never said that.

182
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:35,947
Precious Cao heared this herself.

183
00:10:36,893 --> 00:10:38,820
So Duke Guo is really the person

184
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,344
who brought His Majesty and Precious Wan together.

185
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:42,820
Precious Wan should be thankful.

186
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,629
Many Royal families,

187
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:49,160
and courtmen have heard about Duke Guo,

188
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,180
and have anticipated their daughter or grandaughter to marry Prince Guo

189
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,113
Has Precious Wan ever heard,

190
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,526
of Duke Guo's name?

191
00:11:04,878 --> 00:11:07,445
Before I came into the Forbidden City, I was always kept home.

192
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:10,403
After I came into the Forbidden Palace, I never really did wander outside of my palce much,

193
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,099
so I haven't heard of the Duke's famous name

194
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:15,214
I must have really missed a lot of news.

195
00:11:17,997 --> 00:11:19,166
His Majesty is awsome at literacy,

196
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,885
and is very nice to us concubines and preciouses,

197
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:25,178
Who knew, maybe his majesty had done the same thing

198
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:26,727
to get close to you

199
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,135
Princess Wen Yi must be hungry at this hour,

200
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:40,546
Your Majesty, I'll go back and check it out now.

201
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:42,806
That is fine.

202
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:46,734
Ever since Princess Wen Yi recovered her health, she has been crying a lot lately.

203
00:11:46,734 --> 00:11:49,570
Imperial Doctor Zhang has been checking Princess Wen YI to make sure she is healthy.

204
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,788
As he does that, ask him to see why Princess Wen YI has been crying so much .

205
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:55,654
Yes. After Imperial Doctor Zhang has

206
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:56,935
found the reason, I will inform His Majesty immediately.

207
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:27,057
This qin is a beloved object of the late Emperor's Princess of Su

208
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:31,365
Before you came, I wanted someone to play it for me

209
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:35,196
But Precious Cao -- Cao Qin Mo (mo means silent) -- just as her name

210
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:38,623
is not good at it

211
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,083
May I send someone to ask Mei Jiejie to come

212
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,461
Mei jiejie play the qin so well

213
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:50,700
Meizhuang is more proficient in melody than you

214
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,485
but there's no feeling in her melody

215
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,491
the instrument is good

216
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:01,389
but it will be worthless if there's no feeling

217
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:05,369
So you play it for me

218
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:09,436
I'll play it for your majesty

219
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:29,126
Wonderful the tone is so clear and melodious

220
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:39,885
bluish waves and cool breeze, enjoy the tea and listen to the qin

221
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,866
so enjoyable

222
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:47,587
play Living in the Mountains

223
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,900
I screw it up

224
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:13,461
Please forgive me

225
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:17,324
The sound was wonderful, but you were not concentrated

226
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:21,252
You were thinking about other things

227
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:26,982
I disappointed your majesty,, please forgive me

228
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:28,759
It's your fist time to play this qin

229
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,764
may not familiar with it, and can't be concentrated

230
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:37,550
But I have another doubt

231
00:14:39,138 --> 00:14:42,052
I know your affection to me

232
00:14:43,793 --> 00:14:45,044
but I wonder

233
00:14:45,044 --> 00:14:48,364
when it begins

234
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,491
Whom I see is the one in front of me

235
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,100
no matter his fame and name

236
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:04,642
Explain

237
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:07,701
Your majesty enjoyed the xiao and flowers with me

238
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:09,836
in the name of Duke Guo

239
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:12,986
Even though I adored your talent

240
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,708
but I thought you were duke

241
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,688
so I was cautious

242
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:19,855
and not dare to break the rules and get any closer to you

243
00:15:21,473 --> 00:15:22,694
After your majesty told me the truth

244
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:24,867
your majesty has been very considerate to me

245
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:27,481
not as the normal considerate as to the other concubines

246
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:31,644
I treat your majesty not only as emperor

247
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:33,571
but also as husband

248
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:37,857
If I must tell you a certain time

249
00:15:37,857 --> 00:15:40,167
when my affection began

250
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:43,852
My affection to your majesty began

251
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:47,223
when your majesty helped me with Yushi's trouble

252
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:50,114
I was flustered at that moment

253
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,245
thought it was as easy as lift a finger to you

254
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,622
but in my eyes

255
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,682
your majesty was a hero helped me in need

256
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,093
I'm not serious

257
00:16:11,686 --> 00:16:13,053
Please let me speak it all

258
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:18,250
It may be a capital crime to offend your majesty

259
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:21,578
I regard your majesty as the emperor

260
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,692
but more than the Emperor

261
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,683
I regard and love your majesty as my husband

262
00:16:35,434 --> 00:16:37,942
I know

263
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:40,852
so I love you, too

264
00:16:41,886 --> 00:16:46,093
Huanhuan, today it's me oversensitive

265
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:48,873
don't blame me

266
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:04,547
Si Lang

267
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:11,335
Young mistress, are you suspect that someone

268
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:13,085
told the Precious Cao about the story

269
00:17:13,085 --> 00:17:15,065
of how you and your majesty met

270
00:17:15,842 --> 00:17:17,305
I'm just suspecting

271
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:18,953
and have no evidence

272
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:22,335
But such private thing

273
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:25,205
only those who are close to young mistress know

274
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:27,932
I also didn't know until today

275
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,328
There's only Liuzhu

276
00:17:31,328 --> 00:17:32,650
knows this

277
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:35,331
but Liuzhu

278
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:38,013
came with you as a dowry maid

279
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:39,203
I know

280
00:17:40,348 --> 00:17:42,104
Liuzhu has been with me for so many years

281
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,067
I trust her

282
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:45,183
right

283
00:17:45,183 --> 00:17:47,451
she can't get close to Cao Qinmo

284
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:48,265
and betray me

285
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:50,794
I think so

286
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:54,772
Is it possible that Liuzhu speak it out unaware

287
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:56,896
Is it possible that Liuzhu speak it out unaware

288
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,265
the speaker is unaware, but the listener is aware

289
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:02,624
So it goes orally

290
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,809
then the Precious Cao heard it

291
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,328
Only in this way can we explain

292
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,042
Thanks to his majesty trust me

293
00:18:13,815 --> 00:18:15,117
if not,

294
00:18:15,117 --> 00:18:18,652
I may die without anywhere to bury me

295
00:18:19,096 --> 00:18:20,166
Right

296
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:22,358
Except for his majesty's trust

297
00:18:22,358 --> 00:18:25,063
the other things are not important at all

298
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:40,297
Niangniang, as your instructions

299
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:43,113
I've instructed the kitchens to cut down the dishes

300
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:45,035
and use more vegetable

301
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,712
Fine, his majesty require the Inner Palace to be economical

302
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:51,182
I have to set a good example

303
00:18:52,052 --> 00:18:52,899
Agreed, madam

304
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:58,443
Princess of Glory and Princess of Regularity must follow these measures

305
00:18:58,443 --> 00:19:00,568
Only then would the others listen

306
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,365
Madam is very brilliant

307
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:04,405
I am not brilliant

308
00:19:04,405 --> 00:19:06,002
It was the Precious Shen's suggestion

309
00:19:06,002 --> 00:19:07,873
put forward in front of his majesty

310
00:19:07,873 --> 00:19:09,819
This credit

311
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:11,975
I cannot steal from her.

312
00:19:22,848 --> 00:19:23,989
Niang Niang,

313
00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:26,427
here are the dimsum snacks.

314
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:31,146
There seems to be fewer items

315
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:33,773
Why is my favorite crabmeat pastry snack missing?

316
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:36,893
The imperial kitchens say that the ingredients are too pricey

317
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:38,461
The Empress has instructed them

318
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:40,781
to not use such expensive ingredients anymore.

319
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,397
I can live with daily items being reduced

320
00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:45,405
But cutting even dim sum items is petty

321
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:48,608
Please do not be angry

322
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:51,152
Xing Palace cannot compare with the Palace<br /> (Xing Palace (current location): Imperial temporary palace)

323
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,837
The Empress has always been petty

324
00:19:52,837 --> 00:19:54,784
It's just a few of us

325
00:19:54,784 --> 00:19:56,649
How much can we spend?

326
00:19:58,009 --> 00:19:59,730
Lunch and Dinner both suck

327
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,055
Cucumbers and other vegetables!

328
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:03,352
I hate the sight of such food!

329
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:06,338
My appetite is already poor in the summer.

330
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,035
With such food, I have an even less appetite

331
00:20:09,981 --> 00:20:12,709
Madam, even the Empress' palace is in the same situation.

332
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:17,222
It's that Lady Shen's fault

333
00:20:17,222 --> 00:20:19,621
She persuaded the Emperor

334
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:23,097
She hasn't assistanted in managing the six palaces

335
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,809
She has learnt to use a chicken feather as an arrow [gone vicious?]

336
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:29,800
Song Zhi

337
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,251
Take some cash

338
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:33,708
Everyone can handle hardship

339
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:38,079
Buy something for the maids

340
00:20:40,026 --> 00:20:40,935
Yes

341
00:20:57,109 --> 00:20:59,086
The freshly made plum soup is delicious

342
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:01,846
better than the one in my palace

343
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:03,288
Try it

344
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:06,966
Big Sis, I don't like sour food

345
00:21:08,265 --> 00:21:09,384
Oops, poor memory

346
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:11,607
I'll drink yours too

347
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:14,412
Young mistress has 4 or 5 bowls before sleeping

348
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:15,589
Be careful not to hurt your stomach

349
00:21:18,086 --> 00:21:19,040
You are right

350
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,440
It's warm. That's why this helps

351
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:24,104
Yes, it's well made

352
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,657
Who is this Fu Ling?

353
00:21:25,774 --> 00:21:27,104
A maid in Xing Palace

354
00:21:27,104 --> 00:21:28,513
She takes care of Young Miss

355
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:30,356
Right

356
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,319
Princess Wen Yi turns one next month on the 19th

357
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:35,607
The Emperor wants a big celebration for the princess's birthday

358
00:21:36,752 --> 00:21:37,993
The Emperor is fond of the prince

359
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:39,964
That's why he has seen the boy's mother often

360
00:21:40,691 --> 00:21:42,502
Huafei's dirt didn't affect her.

361
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,223
She's even more pleased than before

362
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,097
Yes I heard about that

363
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:51,543
This person...just a few words from her

364
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:54,531
can make His Majesty doubt you. She cannot be overlooked.

365
00:21:55,793 --> 00:21:58,149
It's good the Emperor has forgotten

366
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:03,254
No matter how much the Emperor loves one

367
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:07,024
without a child, one is powerless

368
00:22:07,857 --> 00:22:09,803
Look at Huafei

369
00:22:09,803 --> 00:22:11,518
although she has power over the 6 inner palaces

370
00:22:11,518 --> 00:22:13,037
but she has no child

371
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:15,809
All her power can be taken away just like that

372
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:18,158
Without a child

373
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:20,609
all your words ring hollow

374
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,502
Big Sis, you are not like her

375
00:22:24,648 --> 00:22:28,463
Indeed we are not alike

376
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:31,459
The Emperor has not been to visit

377
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:35,071
Because of 3rd prince, he still sees them

378
00:22:35,307 --> 00:22:38,090
Even if you have a daughter

379
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,492
the emperor also loves his daughters

380
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:42,722
As long as you have a child

381
00:22:42,722 --> 00:22:44,368
You are recognised

382
00:22:44,368 --> 00:22:48,772
Happiness with the Emperor passes

383
00:22:48,772 --> 00:22:50,679
and one is discarded

384
00:22:54,302 --> 00:22:55,798
By my calculations,

385
00:22:55,798 --> 00:22:59,359
Big Sis, you've been with the Emperor a year

386
00:23:00,315 --> 00:23:03,525
Why no 'good news' yet?

387
00:23:05,604 --> 00:23:08,306
The emperor only visits a couple of times a month

388
00:23:09,164 --> 00:23:12,345
I've been busy with the accounts and learning from the Empress

389
00:23:12,345 --> 00:23:13,886
I haven't had time to concern myself

390
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:19,884
[sigh] Maybe I'm barren

391
00:23:19,884 --> 00:23:22,257
Nonsense!

392
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:25,661
Huafei has also not had a child

393
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,276
We are still young

394
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:29,543
There's lots of time

395
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:32,522
We will have children galore

396
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:33,687
and they will attend upon and please us.

397
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:35,114
Don't worry, Bis Sis.

398
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:38,700
I'm not afraid to share secrets with you

399
00:23:39,337 --> 00:23:41,769
Though it's the god's will to give birth to a prince

400
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:45,027
the planning lies with man, the outcome with god

401
00:23:45,027 --> 00:23:49,388
We have to plan

402
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,549
It's up to the Emperor if he wants to come, right?

403
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:57,724
Who can affect that?

404
00:24:06,551 --> 00:24:07,766
You are imperial physician...?

405
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:09,696
Physician Jiang went home to mourn

406
00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:11,751
The imperial hospital specially sent me, Liu Ben

407
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:13,999
to take Precious Shen's pulse.

408
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:17,055
My lady is inside. Please wait.

409
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,545
Ok

410
00:24:27,311 --> 00:24:29,091
Look, I used every possible means

411
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:31,271
to get this prescription from imperial physician Jiang.

412
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:35,226
If you follow these instructions, you will have a son

413
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:37,346
You try the prescription too

414
00:24:40,108 --> 00:24:41,462
Which Dr. Jiang told you?

415
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:43,346
Are there any other Dr. Jiangs?

416
00:24:43,346 --> 00:24:47,325
he's the best Obstetrician and Gynaecologist

417
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,635
Jiang Cheng?

418
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:51,655
His younger brother Jiang Shen

419
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:53,521
is the imperial doctor who cares for Precious Cao and her daughter.

420
00:24:53,521 --> 00:24:54,614
That's the guy.

421
00:24:55,831 --> 00:24:57,438
Can we believe this prescription?

422
00:24:57,723 --> 00:24:58,947
Don't worry

423
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:01,432
I was also worried

424
00:25:01,432 --> 00:25:03,886
so I sent many people to check his background.

425
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:07,961
It turns out that Jiang Cheng and Jiang Shen have different mothers

426
00:25:07,961 --> 00:25:10,444
and their mothers don't get along well

427
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:12,711
so do them

428
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,122
Otherwise, how would I dare use him?

429
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:17,067
Use it without worries

430
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:18,696
I also perused many medical books

431
00:25:18,696 --> 00:25:20,476
before deciding to use this prescription.

432
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,280
I don't like it

433
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:25,251
Put the prescription away for now

434
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:27,195
Only use it after we've asked Dr. Wen

435
00:25:28,086 --> 00:25:29,742
Liu Zhu, go to the imperial hospital

436
00:25:29,742 --> 00:25:31,310
Check if Dr Wen is around

437
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,167
Invite him over at once

438
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,329
Young mistress

439
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:36,195
the Lord Sun was badly ill

440
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:37,545
He has had to leave on a case

441
00:25:37,545 --> 00:25:39,497
He lives in Sun's mansion

442
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:41,106
Wen will come back

443
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,431
only when Lord Sun get well

444
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:44,097
When did he leave?

445
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:45,449
Yesterday afternoon

446
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:47,261
The old Lord Sun suddenly got ill

447
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:49,079
so Dr. Wen left in a hurry.

448
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,070
That's unfortunate

449
00:25:51,397 --> 00:25:52,371
Never mind

450
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:54,586
I've already taken this twice

451
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:55,736
I feel fine

452
00:25:55,736 --> 00:25:58,021
You don't need to ask him

453
00:25:58,388 --> 00:26:00,329
We're going to drag Dr. Wen all the way here?

454
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:01,317
I just saw

455
00:26:01,317 --> 00:26:03,406
an imperial doctor standing in the courtyard.

456
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:16,405
Since you have a visit from the imperial doctor, I won't disturb you anymore

457
00:26:16,405 --> 00:26:17,990
I will come to see you again tomorrow

458
00:26:20,084 --> 00:26:20,933
Liuzhu

459
00:26:22,811 --> 00:26:24,198
Servant pays respects to mistress

460
00:26:31,613 --> 00:26:33,881
Greetings to the Young Miss

461
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,495
This imperial doctor looks very unfamiliar

462
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,840
I've never seen you before

463
00:26:40,088 --> 00:26:42,359
It is my first visit to you

464
00:26:43,117 --> 00:26:45,742
From your speech, you seem to have a Ji Zhou accent

465
00:26:46,747 --> 00:26:48,085
Just several days ago,

466
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:49,739
servant was transferred here from Ji Zhou.

467
00:26:51,148 --> 00:26:54,518
We are from the same province

468
00:26:55,671 --> 00:26:57,691
It is my honour

469
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,256
Fuling, go pour a pot of Longjing tea

470
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:03,334
Yes

471
00:27:07,322 --> 00:27:10,201
It's Princess Wen Yi's birthday in half a month

472
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:11,960
There are so few children

473
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,806
Naturally we should have a grand celebration for her first birthday

474
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,092
According to his Majesty's instruction, though we're not in the Royal Palace

475
00:27:19,092 --> 00:27:21,127
we can't make it simple

476
00:27:21,127 --> 00:27:23,933
It must be a huge exciting celebration

477
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:26,215
This matter

478
00:27:26,215 --> 00:27:27,982
The Internal Affairs Bureau is on top of things

479
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,091
Thank Your Majesty and Empress,

480
00:27:34,091 --> 00:27:36,235
Princess and I are eternally grateful.

481
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:39,245
You bore a daughter for the Emperor

482
00:27:39,245 --> 00:27:41,719
You deserve credit. No need for thanks.

483
00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:45,980
Having many children is a blessing for our country.

484
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,371
His Majesty doesn't have many children

485
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:50,552
Sisters, please

486
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:53,277
help share in this burden.

487
00:27:54,534 --> 00:27:56,645
Yes, Empress

488
00:27:56,645 --> 00:27:58,997
His Majesty doesn't have many children

489
00:27:58,997 --> 00:28:01,987
but here is one, once we are here,

490
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:06,322
Princess of Glory, don't violate the forbidden subject

491
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:12,342
Others can violate it, but I can't

492
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:17,955
Is a servant's child also fit to be a royal?

493
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,223
4th Prince's mother was indeed lowly

494
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,275
but His Majesty's child is his child no matter what.

495
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,582
Just the same, brothers with 3rd Prince

496
00:28:30,035 --> 00:28:31,039
Is he fit?

497
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,907
Enough, why are you talking about this?

498
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:37,557
We have all been with His Majesty for a long time

499
00:28:38,697 --> 00:28:40,883
Even though you don't care of violating the forbiden subject

500
00:28:40,883 --> 00:28:44,087
what about his majesty's feelings?

501
00:28:46,595 --> 00:28:47,706
I dare not

502
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,903
When you have time, go over lessons with 3rd Prince

503
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:53,424
in case His Majesty starts testing him.

504
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,513
Many thanks for Niang Niang's concern

505
00:28:57,562 --> 00:28:59,522
Lately 3rd Prince has been very hardworking

506
00:28:59,522 --> 00:29:01,313
3rd Prince is studying till late

507
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,025
That's good

508
00:29:03,025 --> 00:29:05,461
3rd prince is His Majesty's eldest son

509
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:07,190
He should set a good example

510
00:29:08,051 --> 00:29:09,645
Hard-working is not enough

511
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:12,949
maybe he is not as good as the lowly one

512
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,535
When I was walking over,

513
00:29:15,535 --> 00:29:18,095
I saw 4th prince at the creek reading aloud

514
00:29:18,095 --> 00:29:22,012
It was much better than 3rd prince's.

515
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:27,338
Empress, tell me. Li Jingui died early.

516
00:29:27,338 --> 00:29:29,512
Who taught 4th Prince

517
00:29:29,512 --> 00:29:32,434
to be even more intelligent that the distinguished 3rd Prince?

518
00:29:33,013 --> 00:29:33,949
You...!

519
00:29:34,636 --> 00:29:36,637
Princess of Glory, don't lose your propriety

520
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:43,565
Princess Wen Yi is about to turn one

521
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:46,851
Your rank should also be promoted

522
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,732
But His Majesty said

523
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:52,155
Now is the time to use military force,and there are a lot of difficulties.

524
00:29:52,155 --> 00:29:54,201
We must wait until after the war has subsided

525
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:56,809
to give you a glorious title ceremony.

526
00:29:56,809 --> 00:29:59,675
It's not a rush

527
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:05,631
Right, I'm appreciate his Majesty's kind intention with my heart

528
00:30:05,631 --> 00:30:07,612
But I'm lowly

529
00:30:07,612 --> 00:30:09,327
I don't dare to take this

530
00:30:09,327 --> 00:30:11,683
I only want to accompany

531
00:30:11,683 --> 00:30:14,812
Your Majesties

532
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,138
I know you are reasonable

533
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:19,386
His Majesty gives you a pair of white jade Ruyi

534
00:30:19,386 --> 00:30:21,126
to used as princess' pillow

535
00:30:23,165 --> 00:30:25,961
In a while, I will have someone bring them to you

536
00:30:26,878 --> 00:30:28,134
Thanks Empress

537
00:30:46,705 --> 00:30:47,676
Qiu Gugu!

538
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,851
Why are you here?

539
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:53,470
Why aren't you with your momos?

540
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,307
They don't care about me

541
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:57,825
Can I pay my respects to the Empress?

542
00:30:58,651 --> 00:30:59,808
Niang Niang just started resting

543
00:31:01,585 --> 00:31:03,298
Then can I pay respects to Imperial Father?

544
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,918
Wait until he summons for you, ok?

545
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:09,461
Men

546
00:31:11,213 --> 00:31:12,442
Escort 4th prince back

547
00:31:12,442 --> 00:31:13,928
Yes. 4th prince, please.

548
00:31:28,157 --> 00:31:31,235
Niang Niang, this lotus is hard to peel. Be careful not to hurt your hands.

549
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:35,441
I know His Majesty likes to eat lotus seeds

550
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:37,284
so I will peel them myself.

551
00:31:37,284 --> 00:31:40,260
In a while, stew some lily lotus soup

552
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,241
for His Majesty to drink.

553
00:31:41,241 --> 00:31:42,656
Niang Niang's sincerity towards His Majesty

554
00:31:42,656 --> 00:31:43,857
is priceless

555
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:46,843
What's the use in sincerity? I have no offspring.

556
00:31:47,465 --> 00:31:50,520
Niang Niang, just now 4th prince came over

557
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:52,454
Why did he come?

558
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:53,881
He wants to see the Emperor

559
00:31:54,703 --> 00:31:55,634
Forget it

560
00:31:55,634 --> 00:31:57,167
If the Emperor sees him,

561
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,701
he will be reminded of the troublesome past again.

562
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:00,511
He will be upset again

563
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,068
Actually, 4th prince's birth mother passed away early

564
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:05,238
He's lonely and helpless, quite pitiful

565
00:32:06,452 --> 00:32:09,153
Do you mean that I should raise 4th prince?

566
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:11,228
Servant thinks

567
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:12,982
that if Niang Niang feels lonely without children,

568
00:32:12,982 --> 00:32:14,909
4th prince is also a candidate.

569
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:18,892
4th prince is the Emperor's least favorite

570
00:32:18,892 --> 00:32:22,450
What's the use in raising him? Never mind that.

571
00:32:25,258 --> 00:32:26,372
When the weather gets hot,

572
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:28,590
my face starts sprouting pimples.

573
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,973
Look at this one...and this one!

574
00:32:32,612 --> 00:32:33,691
All right

575
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:36,296
I think these pimples

576
00:32:36,296 --> 00:32:38,200
look good on your face

577
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:40,762
A couple days ago, Jiejie's face had some pimples

578
00:32:40,762 --> 00:32:43,132
Now they've healed, so you make fun of me!

579
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:46,021
Fine, then I won't make fun of you

580
00:32:46,021 --> 00:32:49,330
If you like, I can teach you a trick

581
00:32:50,704 --> 00:32:52,719
Liu Ben from the imperial hospital is from the same village as me

582
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:55,876
When he came to check my pulse the other day, he gave me a home remedy

583
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:59,906
Look, they've already healed

584
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,209
But I've never heard of Liu Ben before

585
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,756
He came from Ji Zhou just recently

586
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:08,600
His medical skills are quite good

587
00:33:09,026 --> 00:33:10,500
Fellow-townsmen met

588
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,629
Is he a decent person?

589
00:33:13,106 --> 00:33:14,865
I think he's pretty decent

590
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,763
That's good

591
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:19,589
For people serving us,

592
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:21,043
medical skill is secondary.

593
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:23,879
Most important is an upright character with a clear history

594
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:25,561
Of course

595
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:28,304
You have a Wen Shichu

596
00:33:28,304 --> 00:33:30,193
Now I have a Liu Ben

597
00:33:30,193 --> 00:33:32,257
We complement each other

598
00:33:32,932 --> 00:33:34,237
Since Jiejie trusts this person,

599
00:33:34,237 --> 00:33:35,946
did you have him look at the prescription

600
00:33:35,946 --> 00:33:37,136
Jiang Cheng wrote last time?

601
00:33:37,455 --> 00:33:38,381
Yes

602
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:40,971
He said it is indeed a good prescription

603
00:33:46,145 --> 00:33:47,153
Really?

604
00:33:50,265 --> 00:33:51,787
Respects to Niang Niang

605
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:54,479
I thought that

606
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:56,340
we were the only three taking a stroll outside.

607
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,260
I didn't think Precious Smile and Precious Shen were also taking one

608
00:34:00,157 --> 00:34:02,476
The weather is rarely this cool

609
00:34:03,535 --> 00:34:04,981
It's good that Wan Meimei is here

610
00:34:04,981 --> 00:34:06,750
I was just about to look for you

611
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:09,430
Why do Jiejie look for me?

612
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:13,128
Last time, I misspoke

613
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:16,128
I even heard that it caused a disagreement between His Majesty and Meimei

614
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:19,126
But I really had no ill will

615
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:20,949
Now that I see you,

616
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:23,288
I must apologize to Meimei.

617
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:25,074
It's not your fault

618
00:34:25,074 --> 00:34:26,730
I just talked a few words

619
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,939
with his Majesty

620
00:34:27,939 --> 00:34:29,811
It's nothing major

621
00:34:30,498 --> 00:34:32,586
Meimei, you received the emperor's favor.

622
00:34:32,586 --> 00:34:35,907
Since being the favoured one

623
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,243
Chatting with the emperor is a common thing

624
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,156
If it was someone else, it would be a big deal

625
00:34:40,705 --> 00:34:43,089
How can we compare with Precious Smile?

626
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:46,221
Even though we want to talk with his majesty

627
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:48,218
we can't get close

628
00:34:48,575 --> 00:34:49,610
Enough enough

629
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:52,572
Why are we talking standing here?

630
00:34:52,572 --> 00:34:54,173
Come to my place to continue the chat

631
00:34:54,173 --> 00:34:56,613
I specially ordered a feast

632
00:34:56,613 --> 00:34:58,191
so I can apologize to you.

633
00:34:58,191 --> 00:35:00,075
Here, I even invited

634
00:35:00,075 --> 00:35:01,641
Lingering Xin and Princess of Regularity as company.

635
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,709
Wan Meimei, you must do me the pleasure

636
00:35:05,643 --> 00:35:06,780
Precious Shen

637
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,352
I hear you play the [chinese instrument] well

638
00:35:10,352 --> 00:35:14,122
It is said: when the host is cultured, guests frequent his house.

639
00:35:14,122 --> 00:35:16,310
But a host as me

640
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,241
I don't have your talents

641
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,020
So I must ask

642
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,616
Please come and play us some music

643
00:35:26,534 --> 00:35:28,637
Thanks for your invitation

644
00:35:31,018 --> 00:35:32,612
Young mistress, the plum soup has cooled

645
00:35:32,612 --> 00:35:33,934
Ladies, please try the soup

646
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:38,969
You just served us meat and fish

647
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:41,606
Now you're cleaning our greasy mouth

648
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:45,073
You are so thoughtful

649
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:57,243
What happened, Precious Shen?

650
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:01,977
Maybe I ate too much white trotter

651
00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:03,221
and felt ill

652
00:36:03,221 --> 00:36:04,375
Ill?

653
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:07,814
You were fine just now

654
00:36:07,814 --> 00:36:08,903
Why would you be nauseous now?

655
00:36:09,796 --> 00:36:11,490
How long have you felt nauseous?

656
00:36:12,394 --> 00:36:13,985
Lately the weather has been blistering hot

657
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:17,132
I've felt this way for about a week

658
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:22,585
You may be pregnant...

659
00:36:27,956 --> 00:36:29,191
Let me ask you

660
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:31,147
Have you had your period this month?

661
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:34,404
I...

662
00:36:34,935 --> 00:36:37,196
We are all sisters, don't be shy

663
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:38,450
Quickly tell us!

664
00:36:39,261 --> 00:36:42,302
It's late by half a month...

665
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:45,014
It's quite certain then

666
00:36:45,014 --> 00:36:47,138
Princess of Regularity, don't you think?

667
00:36:49,587 --> 00:36:50,814
Any other symptoms?

668
00:36:50,814 --> 00:36:53,136
Do you feel lethargic?

669
00:36:53,136 --> 00:36:54,502
Like you don't want to budge for days?

670
00:36:54,502 --> 00:36:57,339
Or weird cravings for spicy food?

671
00:36:59,381 --> 00:37:03,522
Get the doctor!

672
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:04,584
Yes

673
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:06,109
I want Dr Liu Ben

674
00:37:06,698 --> 00:37:07,688
Yes

675
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,370
You are here first, Your Majesty

676
00:37:19,891 --> 00:37:21,913
Is it true Lady Shen is pregnant?

677
00:37:21,913 --> 00:37:23,488
I have only just heard

678
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:25,925
and don't know the detail, to avoid mistake

679
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:27,086
I've ordered the servant

680
00:37:27,086 --> 00:37:28,674
to fetch the record from the House of Respectful Affairs

681
00:37:28,674 --> 00:37:30,498
Let's go in together

682
00:37:34,608 --> 00:37:36,086
Emperor arrives

683
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,158
- Greetings Your Majesty and Empress <br>- Sit sit

684
00:37:45,204 --> 00:37:46,142
Is it true?

685
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:50,776
Imperial doctor, did you confirm that she's really pregnant?

686
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:56,182
I congratulate Your majesties

687
00:37:56,182 --> 00:37:59,620
Young mistress is indeed pregnant, and has been for about a month

688
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:04,475
All rise

689
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:06,063
Thanks Your Majesty

690
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:08,329
Jian Qiu, bring me the records

691
00:38:15,525 --> 00:38:16,573
Your Majesty, look

692
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:19,312
Served by Precious Shen, March 16th

693
00:38:24,347 --> 00:38:25,327
The date matches up

694
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:30,138
Where is Lady Shen's personal maid?

695
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:33,684
Reporting for duty, Your Majesty

696
00:38:33,684 --> 00:38:36,305
You two are close maids of Precious Shen

697
00:38:36,305 --> 00:38:39,234
She is pregnant and must take special care

698
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:42,222
You are to send a report of her condition every morning

699
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,733
Yes

700
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:45,516
The Empress is most thoughtful

701
00:38:46,233 --> 00:38:49,150
Since Lady Shen is pregnant

702
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,720
should we appoint a dependable doctor

703
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,351
to take care of her?

704
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:56,090
Your Majesty, the one who just came to take my pulse

705
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,486
is Liu Ben from the imperial hospital.

706
00:38:57,486 --> 00:38:59,463
I feel he suits me fine

707
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,510
We are also from the same province

708
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,816
Let him be in charge

709
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:05,947
That's good

710
00:39:05,947 --> 00:39:08,126
Your health is of paramount importance

711
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:10,169
Look after yourself

712
00:39:10,169 --> 00:39:11,963
You must not have any mishaps

713
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,209
Yes

714
00:39:14,256 --> 00:39:15,271
I've been negligent

715
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:16,930
Your Majesties have been here all this time

716
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,521
and I haven't served you any tea.

717
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:20,240
I was simply too happy to remember my manners

718
00:39:21,212 --> 00:39:22,622
I'm getting thirsty

719
00:39:24,483 --> 00:39:26,421
What would you like?

720
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:29,716
I knocked over a bowl of plum soup

721
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:32,008
I'm still thinking of sour plum soup

722
00:39:32,008 --> 00:39:32,729
Quickly, the soup!

723
00:39:32,729 --> 00:39:34,448
Yes, yes, yes, we do have it

724
00:39:34,448 --> 00:39:35,925
If Meimei likes it

725
00:39:35,925 --> 00:39:37,890
I will tell them to send it to you everyday

726
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:41,680
Precious Cao is sooooo thoughtful

727
00:39:42,438 --> 00:39:44,283
Bring the plum soup

728
00:39:45,457 --> 00:39:48,319
Your majesties must be thirsty

729
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:50,081
Other people are okay

730
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:51,951
Remember Precious Wan does not like sour food

731
00:39:51,951 --> 00:39:53,176
Add some sugar in hers

732
00:39:53,176 --> 00:39:54,185
Yes

733
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:56,848
Thank you for your kindness

734
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:07,896
