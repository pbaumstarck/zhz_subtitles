00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,891
<i> ~ Episode 13 ~</i>

2
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:08,501
Your Majesty slept with Precious Shen soundly yesterday.

3
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:10,161
how come you don't rest more?

4
00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:12,827
I still need to worry about the court.

5
00:00:12,827 --> 00:00:15,444
You didn't sleep well yesterday right?

6
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:17,647
First, because I was happy yesterday,

7
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:19,419
Second, also to order the Imperial Doctors

8
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:20,984
to keep an eye on Precious Shen's baby.

9
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:23,870
You've worked hard.

10
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:27,612
About Precious Shen...

11
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:29,881
What are your instructions?

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,879
I want put Precious Shen's rank up higher.

13
00:00:35,757 --> 00:00:38,335
She is loved by you and also pregnant

14
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:40,172
to promote her would not be amiss

15
00:00:40,172 --> 00:00:44,377
But there is no rule that when a concubine or lady is pregnant,

16
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,227
they must be promoted.

17
00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:49,280
The main reason is that she is pregnant

18
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:51,819
That makes her precious

19
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:53,200
Of course,

20
00:00:53,794 --> 00:00:55,880
Precious Smile is smart and intelligent and obeys by the rules,

21
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,157
Her friend Precious Shen behaves magnanimously

22
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:01,362
Do you intend to also promote Smile from 'Precious' to 'Pin'?

23
00:01:02,047 --> 00:01:03,187
She deserves it.

24
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,441
Of course.

25
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:06,490
However, this would mean that

26
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,134
There will be 2 masters in Palace of Whole Blessings.

27
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,138
If she move to other palaces

28
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:12,757
it's inconvenient for Precious Shen since she's pregnant

29
00:01:12,757 --> 00:01:15,446
How about waiting till the birth?

30
00:01:15,446 --> 00:01:17,319
and let the two happy events come together

31
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:21,034
What you said sounds reasonable.

32
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:24,901
How about a gift first?

33
00:01:25,974 --> 00:01:28,141
Gold and pearls are mere trinkets

34
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:30,721
temporarily I cannot promote her,

35
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:32,379
How about choosing a title for her first?

36
00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:34,883
Your Majesty must have already had an idea.

37
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,404
I thought of a word -- 'Hui (virtuous)'

38
00:01:40,988 --> 00:01:42,326
Virtuous and decent

39
00:01:42,326 --> 00:01:44,632
It is suitable for Precious Shen

40
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:50,071
Precious Smile and Precious Shen are like sisters

41
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:52,429
Now they are on the same rank.

42
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:01,963
Jie Jie you are in luck

43
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:03,608
What great fortune?

44
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:05,579
all of a sudden, I almost can't go anywhere.

45
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:06,887
What a pain. I cannot do anything

46
00:02:06,887 --> 00:02:08,481
so boring

47
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:11,153
there's still 9 months. But it is quick

48
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:14,555
I heard that in the 8th month of your pregnancy,

49
00:02:14,555 --> 00:02:17,562
your mother can visit you.

50
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:19,216
A family reunion.

51
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:22,087
Really? That would be great!

52
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,135
I think that the one in your tummy

53
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,327
is suitable for me to be the godmother of.

54
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,000
Look, you are full of potential,

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,983
but you're still afraid no one will call you "mother"?

56
00:02:34,784 --> 00:02:38,278
I don't even know if its a boy or a girl yet.

57
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:39,890
Boy or girl, both are great

58
00:02:40,562 --> 00:02:42,772
But I want it to be a boy.

59
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:45,193
Then I will have someone to lean on..

60
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,481
His Majesty dotes you a lot now.

61
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:50,074
Whether it's a girl or boy, he'll love either

62
00:02:51,396 --> 00:02:53,327
Maybe not until the end of your pregnancy

63
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:55,169
you'll be promoted

64
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:57,305
Stop making fun of me.

65
00:02:57,305 --> 00:02:59,925
Oh yes, this morning,

66
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:01,846
I thought of something important

67
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:03,265
I wanted to tell you now.

68
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:06,060
What is more important than your baby currently?

69
00:03:06,302 --> 00:03:07,569
This is very serious.

70
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:11,170
Princess of Glory is losing power, and she might create trouble again.

71
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,269
I'm afraid that you can't handle her alone.

72
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:17,154
Also, while I think

73
00:03:17,154 --> 00:03:20,427
Our King is not someone who keeps on favouring only one person

74
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:24,872
I'm afraid that someone will take this chance to create mischief

75
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:30,246
You want to bring Ling Long here?

76
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,089
Correct.

77
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:34,820
Look at you. Last time you said Ling Long is evil,

78
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,762
now you think that she is kind.

79
00:03:37,276 --> 00:03:39,577
You don't know. Being cruel has its own benefits.

80
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:42,606
I'm worried that you cannot do it yourself.

81
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:44,637
First bring her here.

82
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:46,628
Then when there is trouble,

83
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:47,758
we can try to solve it together.

84
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:51,351
I will speak to His Majesty about his as soon as possible.

85
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:54,512
His Majesty would most likely agree I think.

86
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:57,721
Now, you are the most favoured one

87
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:59,555
his Majesty must agree

88
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:04,045
But don't think and worry too much. Take care of yourself

89
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:06,435
Also take care of your baby too.

90
00:04:06,435 --> 00:04:08,600
yes sister, what you said is true.

91
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:26,279
Older sister!

92
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:29,302
Finally you came.

93
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:40,249
Was it really hot on your way?

94
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:41,370
No it is alright.

95
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:44,688
Its so warm today, why are you standing here.

96
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:46,589
You're the most fearful of hot weather,

97
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:48,017
you made me worry.

98
00:04:49,976 --> 00:04:51,755
oh yeah, sister mei just said one word,

99
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:53,178
and I was able to come.

100
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:54,618
How is she?

101
00:04:54,618 --> 00:04:55,669
Everything is fine.

102
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:58,495
Now that your here, she is more happy.

103
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,728
Oh I forgot. On my way here,I heard from the eunuches, that

104
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:04,819
now sister mei has a baby,

105
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:06,711
His majesty listens to her words a lot.

106
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:10,575
When you see him you will know

107
00:05:12,048 --> 00:05:14,338
Lets go greet the emporer first.

108
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:16,855
what ever you say.

109
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:28,298
Prince, you have been kneeling here for a whole day already

110
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:31,577
Let's go back already.

111
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,477
Su Gong Gong

112
00:05:34,477 --> 00:05:37,947
Greeting Precious Smile, Greetings Promise An.

113
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:41,583
Su Gong Gong, who is that child?

114
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:45,994
That's the fourth prince. He wants to see His Majesty.

115
00:05:45,994 --> 00:05:47,100
The 4th prince?

116
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:49,310
I've never heard about him before.

117
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,633
He has been raised in Yuan Ming Yuan.

118
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:54,074
His Majesty doesn't have time to see the 4th prince?

119
00:05:55,828 --> 00:05:58,160
I'm afraid he won't have the time to see you and

120
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,278
Promise An either.

121
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:01,111
Young Mistress please go back.

122
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:04,696
How about,

123
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:06,726
let's just go back first.

124
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,319
What a pitiful child.

125
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:12,368
the prince might get sick.

126
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:14,388
please take care of him Gong Gong.

127
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:16,371
send him a lotus seed and lily porridge to clear the summer-heat

128
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,967
yes.

129
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,039
There is not much poeple in Yuan Ming Yuan.

130
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,653
Now that you have come, it will be more lively.

131
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,434
I can only come,

132
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:28,943
because of you and sister Shen remember me.

133
00:06:29,443 --> 00:06:31,119
How is the Emperor and Princess of Glory?

134
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:33,075
Princess of Glory lives far away from his majesty's residence

135
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:34,405
so they rarely see each other

136
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:36,487
Greeting young mistresses.

137
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:39,631
Greeting Precious Smile,

138
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:41,429
may you have good health.

139
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:44,225
Granny Zhang, she is Precious Smile

140
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:45,856
Precious Smile

141
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:47,239
You may rise 4th prince.

142
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,607
You and I have never met

143
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:51,283
how do you know who I am?

144
00:06:51,814 --> 00:06:53,736
I saw you once out of the Hall of Administrative

145
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:56,910
I feel Niangniang is very kind

146
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,538
so I know you

147
00:06:58,538 --> 00:07:00,799
Niangniang also knows me

148
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:02,684
Juat as prince said

149
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:04,922
I also feel like you

150
00:07:05,186 --> 00:07:06,846
And is destined,

151
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,401
to have trouble constantly on your mind.

152
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:10,723
This is Promise An

153
00:07:11,054 --> 00:07:12,404
Greetings Niangniang An

154
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,025
You may rise 4th prince.

155
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:20,541
Sister

156
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,625
Walk around and see if you like it here.

157
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,349
Later I will accompany you

158
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:25,394
to see Precious Shen.

159
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:29,337
I shall take my leave.

160
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:31,626
Liuzhu follow mistress An

161
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:32,522
Yes

162
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:41,496
Precious Smile and I have some things to say to each other,

163
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:42,564
please move further away.

164
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:43,903
Yes.

165
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,092
You and Granny Zhang have a good relationship.

166
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:55,617
what do you have to say to me that even Granny Zhang can't hear?

167
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,550
Excuse me

168
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,632
but Niangniang always accompanies Imperial Father

169
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:03,590
you are most favoured

170
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,665
I just want to ask you a question

171
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:09,556
does Imperial Father dislike me?

172
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,182
Impossible. You Imperial Father is just too busy right now.

173
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:18,574
Then how come he leaves me here every year?

174
00:08:18,574 --> 00:08:20,135
And never comes and visits me?

175
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:22,791
and rarely lets me greet him.

176
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,909
and do what I am supposed to do.

177
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:29,053
There is too much to do in the court. His Majesty is very busy.

178
00:08:29,053 --> 00:08:32,929
and although you have always been in Yuan Ming Yuan,

179
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,981
and rarely sees the Emperor.

180
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,983
the care that his Majesty has given you is no less

181
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,534
than the 5th prince.

182
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:40,598
Don't you see that he rarely visits the 5th prince too?

183
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,609
But 5th prince has his mother, I don't.

184
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:47,812
My mother's position is low, so no one respects her.

185
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:51,337
Respect yourself, then you'll be respected

186
00:08:51,337 --> 00:08:54,215
I don't know whether your mother's position is low

187
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:57,442
But parents always loves their children,

188
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,624
It doesn't matter how anyone else see you,

189
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:04,245
what really matters is how you see yourself

190
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:07,388
In several years, people will eventually come to respect you.

191
00:09:08,594 --> 00:09:09,402
really?

192
00:09:11,098 --> 00:09:14,028
if you don't believe me, then you wouldn't have asked me.

193
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:16,197
Thank you very much for your advice Precious Smile!

194
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:18,328
Just one thing,

195
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:21,271
you and I have only met for a moment,

196
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:22,924
why do you believe me?

197
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:26,318
Being a person that Imperial Father likes, you must be smart and not simple-minded.

198
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:28,630
Also, I heard

199
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,496
that you're not even afraid of Princess of Glory

200
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:33,410
I respect people who are daring.

201
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,708
Thanks for your compliments

202
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:41,684
I have something to tell you:

203
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:43,883
(CHINESE IDIOM) To be the respected one

204
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,168
(CHINESE IDIOM) rather than respect him

205
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:49,246
Is Imperial Father really that busy?

206
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:51,252
If he really is that busy

207
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:53,042
when I grow up, I will help Imperial Father.

208
00:09:53,938 --> 00:09:55,213
You can't say this easily.

209
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:02,347
come, i'll take you to eat dessert.

210
00:10:02,347 --> 00:10:03,401
okay!

211
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,545
Yan Qing Xi Jiu

212
00:10:28,848 --> 00:10:30,667
It is cool and beautiful here

213
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:31,957
what a wonderful place

214
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:34,550
The music coming from above the lake

215
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,275
we can hear it clearly here

216
00:10:40,536 --> 00:10:41,768
The palace's rules are strict

217
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:44,331
so kinsmen of the emperor can't be with concubines

218
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:45,675
except at important festival

219
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:48,131
I don't know any one of these people.

220
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:49,959
Do you know them sister?

221
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:54,505
That one is 5th prince, Prince of Hen with his side lady

222
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:55,798
"Prince Hen"

223
00:11:02,585 --> 00:11:04,466
The first one seems so solemn

224
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:06,070
making me scared.

225
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:13,280
but he's very nice to his side lady

226
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:15,427
"Prince Dun"

227
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:17,354
That is the 10th prince

228
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:19,650
his mother is the late Empress' sister

229
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,318
his identity is so honourable, so he's solemn naturally

230
00:11:24,874 --> 00:11:26,666
the 10th prince was disliked by the late emperor

231
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,093
so he has a bad temper

232
00:11:28,093 --> 00:11:30,918
but he is very nice to his ladies

233
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:34,526
They all say that a brave man is a real man

234
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:38,575
but in my opinion a kind man is a real man

235
00:11:45,086 --> 00:11:49,015
10th, I drink a toast to you and your lady

236
00:11:52,508 --> 00:11:53,610
Thank your majesty

237
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,871
Sister, look at the Prince Dun

238
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:13,495
he is not polite to his majesty

239
00:12:13,495 --> 00:12:15,620
why does his majesty want to win him over ?

240
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:18,959
His majesty ascended the throne not long

241
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,993
and doesn't want the situation to be turbulent

242
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:22,662
and get a accusation of not showing brotherly love.

243
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:36,197
17th must meet some fresh things and doesn't want to leave

244
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:37,909
it is so late

245
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:40,038
Your majesty, you know 17th brother

246
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:40,454
"Duke Shen"

247
00:12:40,454 --> 00:12:42,727
He does whatever he likes

248
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:45,318
It's just a family feast

249
00:12:45,318 --> 00:12:48,563
I know he's always absent, never mind

250
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:55,711
Oh, Precious Virtuous, your hair stick is so delicate

251
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:58,318
Is it from Empress Dowager

252
00:12:59,095 --> 00:12:59,985
Yes

253
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:02,374
Empress Dowager knew Precious Virtuous was pregnant

254
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:04,123
so she specially sent someone to deliver it

255
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:07,071
the two immortals on the hair stick

256
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:10,535
stand for having many children and good luck

257
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:13,947
What is valued in this hair stick

258
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:16,286
is Empress Dowager worn it during she's bearing 14th prince

259
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:19,444
We can see, Empress Dowager is waiting for

260
00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:20,907
the baby in Precious Virtuous' tummy

261
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:23,073
I also want to know

262
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:25,578
how pretty the AGe (prince) is

263
00:13:26,485 --> 00:13:28,041
it may not be a prince

264
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,646
I'm looking forward to a princess

265
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:31,250
as lovely as Wenyi

266
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:35,738
Play with it

267
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:45,826
Princess of Modesty ( Duan Fei)

268
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:06,407
Lady Duan Fei is here.

269
00:14:20,118 --> 00:14:23,457
I wish the King and his wife good health.

270
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,277
You may rise.

271
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:26,779
Thank you my King.

272
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:42,734
Your King has more family members.

273
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,296
Princess of Modesty doesn't meet any others all the time

274
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,435
So you may still keep the old vision.

275
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,762
The sun is so bright, but you still rushed here.

276
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:55,792
It's just a birthday feast for a little child

277
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:57,222
When it's not anything urgent.

278
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,368
Wenyi's first birthday is important

279
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:02,078
I should come here at least to congratulate the both of you.

280
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:04,881
As well, I have not seen Wenyi for a long time

281
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:06,978
You may take a seat then.

282
00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:08,009
Thank you my King.

283
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:10,590
The last time we met.

284
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,649
Princess Wenyi was just 1 month old

285
00:15:13,838 --> 00:15:16,062
Hurry, take princess to the lady

286
00:15:23,134 --> 00:15:25,713
I have a heart too. I wish to hold the baby.

287
00:15:25,713 --> 00:15:27,877
However, I don't have the strength to.

288
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:29,871
and I'm afraid I'd drop her.

289
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,388
Luckily, <br><br>Here

290
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:45,709
This necklace is your marriage gift.

291
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,333
Wen Yi is still a child.

292
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,408
How can you gift her such an expensive gift?

293
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:53,013
You have a memory my King.

294
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:57,188
Unfortunately, over these many years' illness

295
00:15:57,188 --> 00:15:59,627
Keeping it is of no use.

296
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:03,266
Wen Yi is so cute. Giving it to her is best.

297
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,750
Thank you very much my lady.

298
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:09,821
No need to thank me.

299
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:47,890
I want to go out for a walk.

300
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,748
If the King notices, just say I'll be back soon.

301
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:19,885
Let's rest for a bit. My legs are tired.

302
00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:21,240
Me too.

303
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:24,854
Hey, look, there are some big fish in the pond.

304
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,828
Hold this for me.

305
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:41,853
How can you take your shoes off.

306
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:42,697
Don't worry. It's fine here.

307
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:44,419
What if others see you?

308
00:17:45,777 --> 00:17:47,113
Your temper hasn't changed a bit.

309
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:48,533
As if you're still playing in the house.

310
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:57,836
Look, Lui Zhuo, there are so many fish!

311
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:00,557
Looks interesting.

312
00:18:00,921 --> 00:18:02,032
Let's go down to play in the water okay?

313
00:18:12,578 --> 00:18:13,840
The water is pretty cold.

314
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:21,771
Let's go down to play for a bit.

315
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:23,583
There should be no one here.

316
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,899
I just got these clothes made today.

317
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:26,516
If they got dirty, I'd feel sad inside.

318
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:27,804
Get dirty...

319
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,498
Let's see if your clothes get dirty or not!

320
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:32,103
You have to pay for my clothes!

321
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:37,526
Shh. Wait for me here. Hold my arm for a sec.

322
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:41,248
Be careful.

323
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,396
Young mistress! Young mistress! Young mistress!

324
00:18:49,276 --> 00:18:50,442
Who are you?

325
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:52,426
Get away!

326
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,494
You became a drowned rat yourself. And you still blame others?

327
00:18:58,857 --> 00:19:00,009
Who are you? How dare you be disrespectful?

328
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,057
Li Houzhu once said,<br>(Li Houzhu: the final Southern Tang ruler )

329
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:10,738
"Beauty with white hands, <br>she hold aloft the cyan glass to toast to me"

330
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,170
to praise the woman's fair-skinned

331
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:16,285
He said it really is true.

332
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:19,659
I think that is better to use the "Beauty with white and slender feet, she is wearing a cyan clothes."

333
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,077
Better able to express the feet of the white and slender.

334
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:26,659
Help me put on my shoes.

335
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:30,609
Here

336
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:38,322
Duke, please behave yourself!

337
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:42,754
Young Mistress.

338
00:19:42,754 --> 00:19:44,365
Liuzhu, greet the Duke of Fruits

339
00:19:47,294 --> 00:19:49,297
You've never met me, how do you know I'm the Duke of Fruits?

340
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:52,716
Other than the Duke of Fruits, who else in the palace

341
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:55,564
would always have a vertical flute by his side

342
00:19:55,564 --> 00:19:58,519
and who else can be drinking the rose wine from Tibet's tribute

343
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:01,524
and who would dare be so ill-mannered in the palace?

344
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:06,890
Is the smell of wine on me that strong?

345
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:10,565
I beg your pardon

346
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:13,244
You're my brother's newest favourite?

347
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:18,172
This is Precious Smiles!

348
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:24,963
If I have offended you, please forgive me

349
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,776
Your Lord Duke is drunk

350
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:28,789
bring him back to sober up

351
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:31,048
Yes

352
00:20:31,048 --> 00:20:33,539
His Majesty is waiting for me. Please excuse me

353
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:37,228
What is your name?

354
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:39,926
My lowly name is not fit to be heard by you

355
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,207
You are drunk, please go and rest

356
00:20:46,534 --> 00:20:48,210
Today's matter cannot be known by anyone

357
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,609
Otherwise, I'll die without a place for my body to rest

358
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:05,901
My respects to Pin of Respects.

359
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:07,526
Hurry and rise

360
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:11,216
I saw that Meimei's alcohol tolerence wasn't very good

361
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:13,403
and wanted to take a look

362
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:16,172
But who knew that you already weren't inside

363
00:21:16,363 --> 00:21:18,018
I felt that I was reaching my alcohol limit

364
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:19,657
so I came out for a walk

365
00:21:21,171 --> 00:21:23,256
We see the same songs and dances every year

366
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:25,103
I'm rather bored of it

367
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,010
Just look on as shirking.

368
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,152
Is sister willing to

369
00:21:31,152 --> 00:21:34,430
sit with me for a while in the side hall?

370
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:38,464
Niang Niang is so hospitable, of course I will

371
00:21:42,273 --> 00:21:44,031
Your Majesty, I think

372
00:21:44,031 --> 00:21:45,858
that although the songs and dances are magnificent,

373
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:47,461
they're a bit stiff.

374
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:50,970
Since this is a family feast, and everyone present is family,

375
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,844
why not do something more relaxing?

376
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:56,844
Do you have any ideas? Let's hear them.

377
00:21:57,326 --> 00:21:59,411
All the sisters present are Your Majesty's company

378
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:01,247
and naturally have many talents.

379
00:22:01,247 --> 00:22:04,588
Why not write down these talents and draw slips?

380
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:06,602
Whatever one draws,

381
00:22:06,602 --> 00:22:08,197
she must come out and entertain the guests.

382
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:09,578
What does Your Majesty think?

383
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,903
This idea is interesting. Let's do as you say then.

384
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,082
Yes.

385
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,294
It's good that Meimei is kind

386
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:19,771
But in this palace,

387
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,512
being too kind is a bad thing

388
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:25,418
You must remember one thing

389
00:22:25,418 --> 00:22:28,289
protecting oneself is the most important

390
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:30,749
Many thanks for Jiejie's advice

391
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,480
I am stupid

392
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,040
I hope Jiejie will give me more advice

393
00:22:35,611 --> 00:22:37,046
You've met the 4th prince

394
00:22:37,046 --> 00:22:39,928
He's intelligent and healthy

395
00:22:39,928 --> 00:22:42,477
So why does the Emperor refuse to see him?

396
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:46,133
Have you ever wondered why?

397
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,295
I've been ignorant

398
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:51,528
In Palace, people always say "A high status son makes his mother become respected,"

399
00:22:51,528 --> 00:22:55,032
but an unknow saying is "A high status mother makes her son become respected."

400
00:22:56,323 --> 00:22:57,646
His Majesty dislikes 4th prince

401
00:22:57,646 --> 00:23:00,854
because his birth mother was a lowly servant

402
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:02,396
from Rehe Palace (imperial resort).

403
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,874
This matter happened

404
00:23:09,874 --> 00:23:11,442
when the Emperor was still a Duke

405
00:23:11,442 --> 00:23:14,240
Once he had an argument with the 8th prince

406
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,885
and had too much to drink

407
00:23:15,885 --> 00:23:18,062
He thus ended up spending the night with a palace maid

408
00:23:18,951 --> 00:23:22,623
Who knew that this resulted in the 4th prince's birth

409
00:23:23,757 --> 00:23:26,150
And this matter was found out by the 8th prince

410
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,564
who told the previous Emperor

411
00:23:27,564 --> 00:23:30,332
This resulted in the Emperor

412
00:23:30,332 --> 00:23:32,408
being berated for his careless and loose behaviour

413
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:34,180
It almost cost him his Dukedom

414
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:38,160
The palace maid was ugly

415
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,563
and of a lowly status

416
00:23:39,563 --> 00:23:42,216
That's why the Emperor has never liked her

417
00:23:42,216 --> 00:23:44,737
and left her in the Travelling Palace to give birth

418
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,488
This woman had a hard life

419
00:23:47,488 --> 00:23:50,610
she even passed away during labour

420
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:52,970
leaving behind the 4th prince

421
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:57,659
And then the 4th prince was left to be raised in the Yuan Ming Gardens

422
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:00,521
What one cannot see cannot bother you

423
00:24:01,572 --> 00:24:02,698
Thank you for your teachings

424
00:24:03,658 --> 00:24:06,825
It's getting late, we should return to the feast

425
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,802
Your Majesty, I have already prepared everything

426
00:24:25,802 --> 00:24:27,947
Since Hui Meimei is with child,

427
00:24:27,947 --> 00:24:30,025
why don't I

428
00:24:30,025 --> 00:24:32,209
draw the slips?

429
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:35,763
What? You came up with the idea

430
00:24:35,763 --> 00:24:36,889
but you won't participate yourself?

431
00:24:37,283 --> 00:24:39,841
I have no merits. I can only make bead strands.

432
00:24:39,841 --> 00:24:41,441
It is hard for me to be elegant.

433
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:43,683
I've already thought about it

434
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:47,229
Sisters, no matter what you perform,

435
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:50,551
I will give you a bead strand as a token of my appreciation.

436
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,548
Your Majesty, what do you think?

437
00:24:54,804 --> 00:24:58,615
Although you are lazy,I reluctantly let you cross the border.

438
00:25:01,623 --> 00:25:02,703
Really interesting

439
00:25:02,703 --> 00:25:05,373
I've long heard that every Niang Niang in the palace has her own talent

440
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:09,691
Today will be eye-opening

441
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:14,199
Then, how about Empress pick first?

442
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:15,738
You're the birthday girl's mother

443
00:25:15,738 --> 00:25:17,706
You can pick for me

444
00:25:18,692 --> 00:25:20,528
Thanks Empress for the honor

445
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,849
Empress, please share your beautiful calligraphy with us

446
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:35,978
and write the word "Shou" (longevity).

447
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:41,623
In front of so many people...you put me in a difficult spot.

448
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,392
Calligraphy is the Empress's unique talent

449
00:25:46,392 --> 00:25:49,403
In my opinion, Precious Cao's lucky draw

450
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:52,254
makes this a breeze for the Empress.

451
00:25:58,365 --> 00:25:59,572
Since it is so,

452
00:25:59,572 --> 00:26:01,922
today is Princess Wen Yi's birthday.

453
00:26:02,886 --> 00:26:05,653
Then I will write the word "longevity" as a present to her

454
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,111
I thank Empress on behalf of Wen Yi

455
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,881
Empress's handwriting is becoming better and better

456
00:26:40,622 --> 00:26:41,828
Only more compact.

457
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:51,172
Your Majesties, please excuse me

458
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,185
I'm really not feeling well

459
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:56,736
I cannot stay for the fun

460
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:01,171
You are not feeling well. Quickly go back to lie down and rest.

461
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:03,620
I will visit you when I have time

462
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:05,152
Thanks Your Majesty

463
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:14,125
Niang Niang, although your health is important,

464
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:16,711
but leaving this early...

465
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:18,634
I'm afraid it will dampen His Majesty's spirits.

466
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:20,800
If I stayed there,

467
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,791
I'm afraid I would dampen the spirits of those who like to show off.

468
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,073
I really can't stand those fake people

469
00:27:28,073 --> 00:27:30,131
out of sight, out of mind

470
00:27:31,707 --> 00:27:33,439
This is for Precious Smile

471
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:36,335
Please dance Wild Goose Fly (implies girl's light and graceful body)

472
00:27:38,194 --> 00:27:41,106
your majesty, Precious Smile

473
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:43,573
is light and graceful

474
00:27:43,573 --> 00:27:45,202
It is suitable for her

475
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:51,614
Wild Goose Fly is created by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang's Princess of Plum

476
00:27:51,714 --> 00:27:53,414
and lost for a long time

477
00:27:53,614 --> 00:27:56,114
But the former Empress-- Empress of Origin loved dancing

478
00:27:56,214 --> 00:27:58,014
sought this dance

479
00:27:58,314 --> 00:28:00,914
and amended it

480
00:28:00,914 --> 00:28:02,914
Once she danced, the world would be startled

481
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:06,114
so this dance is very popular at that time

482
00:28:06,514 --> 00:28:08,514
But the Wild Goose Fly is the hardest dance to learn

483
00:28:08,714 --> 00:28:11,314
if it was performed well, it will be a surprise

484
00:28:11,614 --> 00:28:14,914
but if not, it will be awful

485
00:28:15,214 --> 00:28:16,814
Sister Wan is young

486
00:28:17,014 --> 00:28:19,314
how can she dance Wild Goose Fly

487
00:28:19,514 --> 00:28:22,914
Precious Cao, you are constraining her

488
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,569
Precious Smile is clever

489
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:30,766
Besides, every girl can dance Wild Goose Fly

490
00:28:30,766 --> 00:28:34,500
if not as good as Empress of Origin

491
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,290
it will be reasonable

492
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,759
we are sisters

493
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,453
we can understand

494
00:28:45,444 --> 00:28:47,681
My dancing skill is poor

495
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:49,989
I'd better not do it

496
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,921
If she can't do it, why constraining her

497
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:56,131
Empress of Origin's movement

498
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:59,427
no one can compare with

499
00:28:59,836 --> 00:29:01,895
Princess of Glory's words are provocable

500
00:29:01,895 --> 00:29:03,761
if sister Smile doesn't dance

501
00:29:03,761 --> 00:29:07,093
Precious Cao and Precious Virtuous will be disappointed

502
00:29:07,093 --> 00:29:08,929
so does anyone else

503
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:11,075
if she does

504
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:14,428
and performed badly, it will be a shame for her

505
00:29:14,428 --> 00:29:16,057
if performed well, it will be fine

506
00:29:16,057 --> 00:29:20,057
but if copy Empress of Origin's dance

507
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:24,119
it will be a disrespect to the former Empress

508
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:29,754
Your majesty, I heard that

509
00:29:29,754 --> 00:29:32,287
you got a Precious Smile

510
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:36,657
talented and beautiful. But she can't dance

511
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:38,599
I'm afraid

512
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:41,886
she's not as good as a geisha in my mansion

513
00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:44,980
how can she serve your majesty

514
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,116
Those women who without talent are moral

515
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:50,801
dance Wild Goose Fly?

516
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:54,677
they are only goodlooking

517
00:29:55,107 --> 00:29:56,253
So

518
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:59,639
she doesn't deserve the reputation of talented and beautiful

519
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:02,418
just serves with her appearance

520
00:30:02,418 --> 00:30:06,079
and it seems that your majesty judge people with their appearance only

521
00:30:08,662 --> 00:30:11,979
Wild Goose Fly is easy to learn but hard to perform well, you'd better not do it

522
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,111
perform another thing

523
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:18,283
Your majesty, Sister Smile is into the book

524
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,060
but not singing and dancing

525
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,546
how about composing a poem

526
00:30:22,546 --> 00:30:23,685
to congratulate the Princess

527
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:34,373
Wild Goose Fly has not been performed in the palaces for a long time

528
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:39,845
I also want to watch it

529
00:30:41,493 --> 00:30:47,437
Precious Smile, you just dance a piece

530
00:30:53,513 --> 00:30:56,169
May I change my clothes first

531
00:31:00,854 --> 00:31:05,307
Changing clothes is fine, but if she wants to pee...

532
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,932
Don't say drunken words in front of his Majesty

533
00:31:15,645 --> 00:31:17,030
It's not that young mistress doesn't know the dance

534
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,868
It's just that to dance or not to dance, good or bad,

535
00:31:19,868 --> 00:31:21,943
are both like riding a tiger.

536
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,524
What others want to see

537
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:26,574
is not the movements of the Wild Goose Fly dance,

538
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:28,517
but a startled bird.

539
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:35,253
Help me change

540
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:50,412
Your Majesty, I have finished changing

541
00:31:54,077 --> 00:31:55,161
Your majesty

542
00:31:55,161 --> 00:31:58,007
ordinary instruments are in poor tasts

543
00:31:58,007 --> 00:31:59,815
Allow me to play the instrument

544
00:31:59,815 --> 00:32:02,798
an Sister An to sing a song to accompany Precious Smile's dance.

545
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:06,273
I would be glad to

546
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,918
Get the Princess Dowager Shu's "Always Miss" qin

547
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:17,522
When the late Emperor's Princess Shu first came in the palaces

548
00:32:17,522 --> 00:32:20,498
The late Emperor give her a zither named Always Miss

549
00:32:20,498 --> 00:32:24,777
and a flute named Always Together as the taken of love

550
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:28,715
After the late emperor passed away,

551
00:32:28,715 --> 00:32:31,050
Concubine Shu requested to leave the palace to practice Buddhism.

552
00:32:31,887 --> 00:32:34,452
This zither and flute were left in the palace

553
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,063
Today, you are lucky.

554
00:32:54,286 --> 00:32:57,693
(Lyrics from Goddess Luo Rhapsody)

555
00:32:57,693 --> 00:33:02,100
<i>She with a charming sprightly carriage,<br>like a lightly flew frightened wild goose.

556
00:33:03,576 --> 00:33:08,773
<i>Her body curves soft, <br>like a dragon playing soar up into the air.

557
00:33:09,353 --> 00:33:13,827
<i>Her face is bright, <br>like a chrysanthemum in full bloom in the fall.

558
00:33:15,331 --> 00:33:19,393
<i>Her body is plump, <br>like spring dense pine.

559
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:27,599
<i>Aerial behavior like cloudlet gently hide the moon.

560
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:40,501
<i>Flying Image like a breeze blow convoluted snowflakes.

561
00:33:44,498 --> 00:33:47,398
<i>From afar,

562
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:53,800
<i>bright white like a rising sun in the sunglow.

563
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,648
Her movements cannot compare to those of Empress Chun Yuan's back in the day

564
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:03,382
Beautiful, but not creative

565
00:34:04,536 --> 00:34:07,479
Respects are more important than creative

566
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:05,116
How many more surprises do you have that I don't know about?

567
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:10,846
It's just my little trick, your majesty don't laugh at me

568
00:36:14,025 --> 00:36:16,038
Surly, the dance is so wonderful

569
00:36:16,038 --> 00:36:20,208
comparable to the top dancer at my estate

570
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,420
10th brother, you don't understand

571
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,628
Precious Smile's dance is as great as the Princess of Plum's

572
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:28,509
Long ago, Princess of Plum dance the Wild Goose Fly

573
00:36:28,509 --> 00:36:30,151
Xuan Zong called her Plum Spirit

574
00:36:31,412 --> 00:36:34,118
Wild Goose Fly is originated from Princess of Plum

575
00:36:34,118 --> 00:36:36,951
Today, I also watched a great classic

576
00:36:36,951 --> 00:36:40,967
You haevn't ever seen Princess of Plum dance

577
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:44,884
how can you speak so definite

578
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:48,673
When it comes to riding and archery, of course I can't compare to 10th brother

579
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,625
but when it comes to history books,

580
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:54,388
I have read more than 10th brother.

581
00:36:54,774 --> 00:36:57,893
We Manchurians rule the world through riding and archery

582
00:36:57,893 --> 00:37:02,456
What's the use in reading so many stinking history books?

583
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:05,834
It's only because your birth mother is a Han

584
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:08,932
and taught you all these Han habits.

585
00:37:08,932 --> 00:37:15,503
The Qing dynasty needs both people who are talented in literary and military capacities

586
00:37:16,893 --> 00:37:20,048
My imperial brothers are my left and right arm

587
00:37:21,011 --> 00:37:25,633
Both have their merits. Why compare which is better?

588
00:37:30,144 --> 00:37:32,892
Your majesty, just as I said before

589
00:37:32,892 --> 00:37:35,410
Precious Smile is indeed intelligent

590
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,769
She can dance what most people can't

591
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:39,805
I think her dance movements

592
00:37:39,805 --> 00:37:42,565
must do justice to Empress of Origin's original dance?

593
00:37:49,398 --> 00:37:52,473
I remember that when Empress of Origin created this dance,

594
00:37:52,473 --> 00:37:55,424
even Princess of Glory hadn't entered the prince's estate yet.

595
00:37:55,424 --> 00:37:57,967
Not to mention you, Precious Cao

596
00:37:59,854 --> 00:38:03,787
How would you know what Empress of Origin's dance was like?

597
00:38:03,787 --> 00:38:05,983
And how could you compare Precious Smile's dance

598
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,485
to it?

599
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,939
I was rash. I only heard of it.

600
00:38:12,939 --> 00:38:14,967
I regret to not have seen Empress of Origin's dance

601
00:38:14,967 --> 00:38:16,219
in person.

602
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:21,085
You danced for so long. Are you tired?

603
00:38:22,154 --> 00:38:23,137
I'm not tired

604
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:26,828
I have never seen Empress of Origin's

605
00:38:26,828 --> 00:38:28,563
exquisite grace in dancing the Wild Goose Fly.

606
00:38:28,563 --> 00:38:30,367
it's my pity

607
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:33,373
The Wilde Goose Fly I just danced

608
00:38:33,373 --> 00:38:37,257
imitate Princess of Plum's, <br>how could my candle light

609
00:38:37,257 --> 00:38:40,174
compare with Empress of Origin's moon light

610
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:55,014
17th brother! You're late. You must drink 3 cups of wine as penalty.

611
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:57,681
I just played music

612
00:38:57,681 --> 00:38:59,716
to accompany my new sister-in-law's dance.

613
00:38:59,716 --> 00:39:02,974
Imperial brother must, on behalf of new sister-in-law,

614
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:04,339
let me off the hook.

615
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:06,688
Only when Always Miss

616
00:39:06,688 --> 00:39:09,378
accompany Always Together

617
00:39:09,378 --> 00:39:12,199
could it be perfect

618
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,136
This is Precious Smile, Zhen Shi

619
00:39:19,263 --> 00:39:21,567
This is Precious Hui, Shen Shi

620
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:27,726
The one singing

621
00:39:31,714 --> 00:39:32,859
I am Promise An

622
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:33,766
Reward!

623
00:39:36,826 --> 00:39:38,835
You! Sit next to me.

624
00:39:39,972 --> 00:39:40,846
Thanks Your Majesty

625
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:49,346
17th brother finally came!

626
00:39:49,831 --> 00:39:50,995
Here, sit

627
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,900
Princess of Glory, what's the matter with you?

628
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,688
It's such a joyous day. Why must you dampen the mood?

629
00:40:03,186 --> 00:40:07,485
<i>Thank you for watching! <br><i>Please join us!
