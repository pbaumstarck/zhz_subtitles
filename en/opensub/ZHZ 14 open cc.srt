00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,867
<i> ~ Episode 14 ~</i>

2
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:09,908
What's wrong with you?

3
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:13,230
On such a good day, why are you ruining the mood?

4
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:19,060
I'm not very sad over anything.

5
00:00:20,027 --> 00:00:23,248
But I saw Precious Smile dance Wild Goose Fly

6
00:00:23,827 --> 00:00:27,668
it recalled my sadness, so I lost my deportment

7
00:00:27,668 --> 00:00:32,553
You were not in the mansion when Empress of Origin dance the Wild Goose Fly

8
00:00:33,138 --> 00:00:36,306
Where did your sadness come from

9
00:00:37,818 --> 00:00:40,484
I read some poetry during my spare time

10
00:00:40,484 --> 00:00:45,186
and read the Poem of Eastern Building that was written by Princess of Plum

11
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:46,885
it touched my heart

12
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:52,557
Wild Goose Fly originate from Princess of Plum, she danced it when she's favoured

13
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,243
while Poem of Eastern Building wrote when she was restricted in Palace of Shang Yang

14
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:01,789
Today the Wild Goose Fly, reminded me of the poem

15
00:01:02,927 --> 00:01:05,970
I feel so sorry for Princess of Plum

16
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:11,209
You never put your heart into books

17
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:13,747
why did you read them then?

18
00:01:13,747 --> 00:01:15,904
I was silly

19
00:01:15,904 --> 00:01:19,137
I heard that reading could cultivate myself.

20
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:21,472
I know I have no talent

21
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:23,425
if I don't educate myself

22
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:26,298
I will have no face to serve your majesty

23
00:01:26,298 --> 00:01:29,923
You just said the poem touched your heart

24
00:01:31,028 --> 00:01:32,703
Come and tell us.

25
00:01:36,314 --> 00:01:42,212
Your love was deeply attached to me<br>We talked hert to heart sentimentally

26
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:47,104
You promised me your love will last as long as the world exists

27
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:52,662
but the beatiful and angry one

28
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:57,590
robbed my favour and restrained me in the cold palace

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,003
The favour won't come again, even unclear in the dream

30
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,654
Everytime I read this

31
00:02:09,654 --> 00:02:13,309
I know Princess of Plum's lovesickness deeply

32
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:25,448
My King, this matter concerning lady Hua Fei

33
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:27,626
is the private matter of your family.

34
00:02:27,626 --> 00:02:29,757
I dare not intervene.

35
00:02:29,757 --> 00:02:33,363
It's just that Lady Hua Fei served the King for many years.

36
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:36,338
And she hasn't made any major mistakes.

37
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:38,442
So if she ever serve you wrong

38
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:41,845
Please be kind as she has been with you for a long time and

39
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:43,880
Forgive the lady.

40
00:02:48,574 --> 00:02:50,771
Hua Fei

41
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:54,184
I have really wronged you.

42
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:56,813
The place you live is too far away.

43
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:59,422
When I have free time, I will come visit you often.

44
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,689
Thank you my King.

45
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:10,570
This sister would like to ask you something.

46
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,084
That piece of paper

47
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:15,333
was kept hidden in your sister's sleeve the entire time right?

48
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,269
That is why the dance,

49
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:21,348
was set by my sister.

50
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:23,697
My older sister has a good heart.

51
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:25,448
Little sister, what are you talking about?

52
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:27,804
I don't understand what you mean.

53
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:29,710
My sister is very clever.

54
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,008
So of course you would know that without the Wild Goose Fly dance the poem will never be read

55
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:39,221
Princess Plum's love poem didn't win the king's heart back

56
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:41,497
Lady Hua Fei has touched the heart of the King.

57
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:45,086
So if Princess Plum is still alife

58
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:47,795
She would definately understand my dear old sister's well-intentioned act

59
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:51,740
Little sister, whatever you say

60
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,150
I your sister, isn't a good arguer

61
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,991
However, if my daring little sister is ever free, you should really take care of Precise's fetus

62
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:02,782
That is what the King really cares about.

63
00:04:02,782 --> 00:04:04,221
Of course.

64
00:04:16,476 --> 00:04:18,840
I spend so much time and thought into bring her down

65
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,032
And now I have to watch her coming back up so easily

66
00:04:22,032 --> 00:04:24,260
How am I suppose to deal with it willingly

67
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,206
Actually, deep down in you heart, my sister, you know that

68
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:29,069
Concubine coming back up is well-expected

69
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,210
It's only a matter of time of when she will regain her power

70
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,919
No...I was just scared that our life won't be as easy and comfortable as this again

71
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:38,476
But as long as we have this one in my sister's tummy, we don't have to be afraid of anything.

72
00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:40,448
So you shouldn't be angry

73
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:42,030
You should take good care of your baby instead

74
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,647
It's only one month old.

75
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,535
We don't even know if it's a girl or a boy.

76
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,756
Whether it's a girl or a boy, both are good.

77
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:49,303
It'd still be our lovely baby.

78
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:53,691
Baby, convince your mother to not be angry anymore.

79
00:04:55,371 --> 00:04:57,378
You, always like to joke around.

80
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,870
You know... After what happened today, The queen is the one who is suppose to be getting all the headaches

81
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,905
And she isn't even in any hurry, so why should we?

82
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,984
You're right.

83
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:10,745
But when I saw you dance, I was so worried.

84
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:12,583
I know that you can dance.

85
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:16,330
When actually, whether you danced or not was still wrong.

86
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,669
What happened today is only due to my luck

87
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:22,714
But Precious Cao is vicious inside

88
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:25,897
Even if she hates you, it can't compare to how much the King loves you.

89
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:29,732
But you, always make the King so stressed.

90
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:33,296
If you showed off your dance skill earlier, they wouldn't set such a trap

91
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:36,232
Thanks to they don't know what I can and cannot do.

92
00:05:36,232 --> 00:05:38,939
otherwise, they would know how to put me into the trap

93
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:45,086
Precious Smile

94
00:05:45,086 --> 00:05:46,567
His majesty got some good poems

95
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:49,261
Please go to the Hall of Politics to appreciate

96
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:52,790
Then you better go quickly, don't let the King wait.

97
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,508
Then I'll go.

98
00:06:02,851 --> 00:06:03,853
Su Gonggong

99
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:05,815
Greetings Lady Wan.

100
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:08,436
Some of the court men are still in there.

101
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:10,972
you will have to wait a while, young mistress

102
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:12,025
Yes.

103
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:17,230
Your majesty, now the imperial court is useing military forces to defend the Northwest

104
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,735
Princess of Glory's elder brother is in charged

105
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:22,599
Please think twise

106
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:28,884
Now the soldiers are needed, for the nation's sake<br>your majesty should forgive Princess of Glory

107
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:31,232
to comfort the soldiers

108
00:06:31,232 --> 00:06:34,182
I know. You may all leave.

109
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:40,489
Greetings Young Mistress

110
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,848
Young Mistress, this way please.

111
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:51,034
Your Majesty, Lady Wan is here

112
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:55,190
Greetings your majesty

113
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,372
Peace and prosperity to you

114
00:06:57,372 --> 00:07:01,801
My head hurts really bad. Come here and help me massage it.

115
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:02,924
Yes.

116
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:22,331
Your Majesty is troubled

117
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:24,041
How do you know?

118
00:07:25,857 --> 00:07:28,253
Although the hall is filled with Muo Li flowers,

119
00:07:28,253 --> 00:07:31,757
i can still smelled the menthol oil

120
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:37,398
You always use menthol oil when you're troubled

121
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:39,604
You always know what I am thinking

122
00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:49,049
Guess what I am troubled by

123
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:53,347
your majesty must be worrying about government and court issues.

124
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:59,538
correct

125
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:01,509
the royal harem is also part of my troubles

126
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:08,347
the empress has worked hard to manage and fix the big and small issues in the royal harem.

127
00:08:08,347 --> 00:08:10,140
someone should help her out

128
00:08:11,262 --> 00:08:12,887
what do you think?

129
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:15,546
Concubine Hua has always been helping the royal harem

130
00:08:15,546 --> 00:08:17,923
she may be able to help the empress

131
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:21,316
Besides, that case was Pin of Beauty's fault

132
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:24,391
Princess of Glory may not involved

133
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:27,173
Pus, what the empress dowager does not really like

134
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,603
concubine hua is that she is so tactical and cruel sometimes

135
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:31,561
The punishment to her is enough now

136
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:39,505
This case

137
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:42,719
may be unfair to you

138
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,710
but don't worry, I will be on your side

139
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:51,867
Nothing is unfair to me

140
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:54,532
as long as it is for your majesty

141
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:02,335
It was strange

142
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:05,140
even the Prince Dun has come to plead for you

143
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:10,125
he's usually arrogant, has no respect to his majesty

144
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:13,271
he has the right to be arrogant

145
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:17,926
his birth mother, Precious Princess of Wenxi, is Empress Xiao Zhaoren's sister

146
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:22,369
and the Empress Dowage at presant was once the Empress Xiao Zhaoren's school maid

147
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:23,933
when the nine princes faught for the throne

148
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:29,367
The 8th, 9th and 14th prince who got along well with 1oth prince were all demoted

149
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:32,140
only himself is still a prince

150
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:38,379
How could he bear seeing his majesty got on the throne

151
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,363
So why does he help you

152
00:09:41,503 --> 00:09:44,508
He is not helping me

153
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:48,406
he is following the current situation and do my brother a favor

154
00:09:48,406 --> 00:09:49,701
General Nian?

155
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:52,502
Prince Dun 's status is hight

156
00:09:52,502 --> 00:09:56,158
When the late emperor's alive,<br><br> he has worked together with my brother and 14th

157
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:58,196
dealed with the Qinghai's case together

158
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:00,130
we can say they're friends

159
00:10:04,476 --> 00:10:06,914
It doesn't matter. Whoever helps my lady is still good in the end.

160
00:10:06,914 --> 00:10:10,745
As long as you can receive the love of the King.

161
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:15,546
Is everything ready?

162
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:16,555
Yes, everything is prepared.

163
00:10:16,555 --> 00:10:18,902
The King loves it when the lady wears red.

164
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:22,688
Then quickly help your lady dress. <br><br><br>Yes.

165
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,687
Don't make the King wait.

166
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:30,497
Niang Niang worked hard all day

167
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,884
It would be beneficial to rest now.

168
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:36,958
During these past few days, I've laughed so much, my mouth has become tired.

169
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,723
In these times, my lady must smile even when you don't wish to.

170
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,307
It must be tiring for my lady.

171
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:46,369
It's because the Queen must never show her tired state.

172
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,705
Then, I'd be seen as insufficient by others

173
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:53,574
Those who eye my position

174
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:56,648
If they don't try to strip me of my health and title, it'd be strange.

175
00:10:56,648 --> 00:10:58,749
My lady's words are correct.

176
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:01,853
The way Princess of Glory looked so content today

177
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:03,991
I couldn't stand it.

178
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:06,939
What happens to her depends on the emperor

179
00:11:08,937 --> 00:11:12,007
It's just that when I set my eyes on that child, Wen Yi.

180
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:18,213
I think of my Hong Hui at his first birthday.

181
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:20,469
If 1st prince were still alive...

182
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:22,857
If Hong Hui were still alive,

183
00:11:22,857 --> 00:11:25,797
He'd probably be taller than the Third Brother.

184
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:27,941
He'd look more handsome.

185
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:29,920
And he'd definitely be smarter than the Third Brother by far.

186
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:34,667
That's right.

187
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:37,550
When he was two, he could already recognize characters.

188
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,444
The Third Brother can't compare at all.

189
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:45,143
Niangniang are still young

190
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:47,177
You can definitely have another prince

191
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:51,036
I'm already in my forties.

192
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:54,378
I'm beyond child-bearing age

193
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:56,768
As well, after sister's death,

194
00:11:56,768 --> 00:12:01,036
His Majesty never treated me again the way he did before.

195
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:06,668
The state of my body, I know it myself. <br><br>It can't happen again.

196
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:08,411
Although the King does not speak of it.

197
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:11,858
But in his heart, he still listens to my lady very well.

198
00:12:11,858 --> 00:12:16,089
A woman can't even receive her husband's love.

199
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:18,875
If she only attains respect, what use is that?

200
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:24,413
You've spent all this time with me

201
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:26,065
How does His Majesty treat me

202
00:12:26,065 --> 00:12:29,902
compared to how he treated Jiejie in the past?

203
00:12:29,902 --> 00:12:34,050
Niang Niang, actually before Empress of Origin entered the estate,

204
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,197
He treated you very well.

205
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:44,771
No matter how well he treats me, it can never compare to how much better he treats sister.

206
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:46,379
Empress Dowager too

207
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:52,250
After all, I'm a illegitimate

208
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,262
unlike sister is legitimate

209
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,325
If Hong Hui were still alive,

210
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:02,810
he would be the eldest son of his majesty,and legitimate

211
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,866
How honourable he would be

212
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:13,000
When Hong Hui died,

213
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:17,839
The weather was just like this.

214
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:27,848
My head hurts so much.

215
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,148
My lady.

216
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,830
My lady.

217
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:50,203
Has young mistress eaten well for the last couple days? Do you still feel like throwing up?

218
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:53,815
That's what's weird.

219
00:13:53,815 --> 00:13:56,106
During these few days, I haven't wanted to vomit at all.

220
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:58,145
As well, my stomach aches for no reason.

221
00:13:58,145 --> 00:14:00,702
You have had the medicine

222
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:03,785
so you are fine

223
00:14:03,785 --> 00:14:07,062
As for the stomach pains and chills,

224
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:09,312
It's only been a month since you've been pregnant.

225
00:14:09,312 --> 00:14:12,677
It's very normal. Do not worry.

226
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:15,065
If you say so, then I feel much at rest.

227
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:19,470
I thought that it's a time when I should be vomiting.

228
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,048
Young mistress's health is sturdy, how could you get morning sickness?

229
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:24,008
I think that my lady

230
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:26,857
will give birth to a very healthy son.

231
00:14:26,857 --> 00:14:29,513
Then I'll believe you

232
00:14:29,513 --> 00:14:30,978
Cai Yue. <br><br><br><br>Yes.

233
00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:34,111
Give the hawthorn cake from father to Doctor Liu.

234
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:35,481
Thank you very much.

235
00:14:46,793 --> 00:14:50,363
I can tell right away that this hawthorn cake is from Qishun Store

236
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:55,003
Didn't Qishun stop making cakes two years ago?

237
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:57,978
Doctor Liu came to the travelling palace at the beginning of the year

238
00:14:57,978 --> 00:14:59,345
How could you not know?

239
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:05,701
Uhhh...when I think of home, I always remember snacks from Qishun

240
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:08,083
so I always think the store's still there.

241
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,941
I misspoke, I hope young mistress forgives me

242
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:14,029
Seems like you miss home

243
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:17,908
If you like, I will have Caiyue wrap up more of them for you to bring back

244
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:21,011
I thank young mistress

245
00:15:21,011 --> 00:15:22,258
- Fuling<br>- Yes

246
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:24,812
- Escort Doctor Liu out<br>- Yes

247
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:26,902
Doctor Liu, this way please

248
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:28,827
Humble servant thanks young mistress

249
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:49,175
Take a break, young mistress. Be careful not to strain your eyes.

250
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:58,694
It's almost done. Let me finish first.

251
00:15:58,694 --> 00:16:00,286
Why the rush?

252
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:02,366
Precious Hui has only been pregnant for a month

253
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:05,579
It will be 8 more months before the baby can wear the undergarment you embroidered

254
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:09,116
I must finish embroidering this first

255
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:10,827
If Sister Mei sees it

256
00:16:10,827 --> 00:16:14,536
and likes it, I will make some more.

257
00:16:14,536 --> 00:16:17,294
Don't you know, children grow very quickly

258
00:16:17,294 --> 00:16:19,000
They grow up in an instant

259
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,555
How could it work if I don't make more?

260
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:24,098
Look at you...as if you've had children before

261
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,356
When I was at home,

262
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:35,843
I often saw mother sewing this and that for the first wife's children.

263
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:39,507
So I know a little bit

264
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:42,160
Servant misspoke, and brought up sad memories for young mistress

265
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,170
Young mistress please punish me

266
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,918
Quickly get up

267
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:48,601
Why would I punish you?

268
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:52,455
I just don't know how mother is doing right now

269
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:55,994
Madam must feel proud that you've entered the palace

270
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:59,268
I am only a Promise without favor

271
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,769
His Majesty probably doesn't even remember who I am

272
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:08,443
No need for this dragon to fly

273
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,167
as long as it stays

274
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:17,281
Young mistress, bad news

275
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:18,033
What happened?

276
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:19,479
Mr. An is in trouble!

277
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:24,527
Young mistress!

278
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,877
Jiejie!

279
00:17:30,877 --> 00:17:32,068
Jiejie help!

280
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:33,392
Lingrong, what happened?

281
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:34,627
Get up, speak calmly

282
00:17:34,627 --> 00:17:38,088
Jiejie, my father has been imprisoned

283
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:40,578
How could that have happened?

284
00:17:40,578 --> 00:17:44,531
I received news from home that Jiang Wen Qing

285
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,638
has been under orders to go to the Northwest

286
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:49,380
My father was also sent along with the troops

287
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,661
Who knew, they met enemy soldiers along the way

288
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:54,756
who robbed them of the army provisions.

289
00:17:54,756 --> 00:17:56,776
Jiang Wenqing also escaped

290
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,604
with a good amount of silver.

291
00:17:59,604 --> 00:18:03,382
His Majesty was furious and ordered Jiang Wenqing to be immediately captured

292
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,902
and imprisoned along with father.

293
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:09,442
Right now, it's uncertain whether he's alive or dead

294
00:18:09,442 --> 00:18:11,787
I'm afraid that in a moment of anger,

295
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:14,314
His Majesty will take father's life.

296
00:18:16,273 --> 00:18:17,543
Are you sure

297
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:19,743
that your father was really involved in this?

298
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:22,970
He couldn't be. Father is always overcautious

299
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,556
and only seeks self-preservation.

300
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:28,830
He would never ever be involved with Jiang Wenqing's affairs

301
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,654
Things have not been settled yet. Don't cry so much right now.

302
00:18:31,654 --> 00:18:33,149
It's more important for us to think of a solution

303
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:33,632
Yes

304
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:38,833
I know that military intelligence is a serious matter

305
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:43,953
I'm afraid that things look grim for father

306
00:18:43,953 --> 00:18:45,615
This has happened to your family

307
00:18:45,615 --> 00:18:48,362
Of course we will plea with the Emperor for you

308
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,911
But on affairs of state...

309
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:52,553
it might not be our place to intervene.

310
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:53,551
True

311
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:55,630
No need to disturb the Emperor

312
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,422
Mei Jiejie can solve this matter

313
00:18:58,422 --> 00:19:00,456
Me?

314
00:19:00,456 --> 00:19:03,647
Because this happened in the jurisdiction of Ji Zhou

315
00:19:03,647 --> 00:19:07,041
Mei Jiejie's father is one of the examiners in the case

316
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:13,567
Mei Jiejie, I'm begging you, please save my father

317
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,598
Let me think of a way

318
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:18,784
Let me think

319
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:24,412
I'm begging sister to write a letter to save my father

320
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:26,823
Alright, don't worry

321
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:30,439
But I must first see the Emperor to test his intentions

322
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:38,959
Thanks Jiejie! Lingrong is eternally grateful.

323
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:42,034
Lingrong, stop crying

324
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,614
Precious Hui

325
00:19:52,614 --> 00:19:54,767
You are with child. How could you come out here?

326
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:57,020
Watch out for the sun

327
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,263
Is His Majesty inside?

328
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,224
He is

329
00:19:59,224 --> 00:20:02,453
but Mr. Zhang Tingyu and Mr. Longkeduo are also inside.

330
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:03,946
Young mistress, you must wait a bit

331
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:06,556
What? Even Longkeduo is here?

332
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:11,974
Something happened to the military provisions that were en route to the northwest

333
00:20:11,974 --> 00:20:15,334
It's a matter of military intelligence. His Majesty is absolutely furious right now.

334
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:17,404
Is Promise An's father involved in this?

335
00:20:17,404 --> 00:20:20,118
That I don't know

336
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,853
I just know that His Majesty ordered

337
00:20:22,853 --> 00:20:26,282
that Jiang Wenqing be immediately executed.

338
00:20:26,282 --> 00:20:28,364
Then...what about the other people?

339
00:20:28,364 --> 00:20:30,382
I don't know

340
00:20:30,382 --> 00:20:31,775
What?

341
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:34,905
Did Precious come to plea for Promise An's father?

342
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:37,469
Yes, Promise An is devastated

343
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,068
I can't just sit by and watch

344
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:39,937
No no no

345
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:45,689
In my opinion, Precious best not get involved in this

346
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:47,267
Gong Gong, please elaborate

347
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:53,407
His Majesty hates when the inner palace meddles in political matters

348
00:20:53,407 --> 00:20:55,686
In particular, this is a huge matter of military intelligence

349
00:20:55,686 --> 00:20:58,428
dealing with Nian Gengyao's military situation in the northwest.

350
00:20:58,428 --> 00:20:59,690
If you open your mouth,

351
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,946
aren't you making enemies with Princess of Glory?

352
00:21:01,946 --> 00:21:04,703
But this isn't an issue of making enemies

353
00:21:04,703 --> 00:21:06,442
If I can save someone's life,

354
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,557
I can't just stand by and watch.

355
00:21:08,557 --> 00:21:11,061
You can only watch

356
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,487
Just think, whether the Emperor finds out or not,

357
00:21:14,487 --> 00:21:19,503
if you write home, Mr. Shen will be more lenient in his sentencing.

358
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:22,399
But if someone gets a hold of this and blows it out of proportion,

359
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:24,490
the Emperor will be furious!

360
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:28,041
Then what about your father's future prospects?

361
00:21:32,096 --> 00:21:35,844
But...if Promise An's father is really innocent...

362
00:21:35,844 --> 00:21:40,319
If he's really innocent, he will be vindicated

363
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,470
Didn't you see the big temper His Majesty threw over this just now?

364
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,732
If you go you'll be in trouble

365
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:51,330
Besides, you are now pregnant with His Majesty's child

366
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,764
You will soon assist in managing the six palaces

367
00:21:53,764 --> 00:21:56,848
You can't afford to tread through these troubled waters

368
00:21:56,848 --> 00:22:02,001
Besides, once you open your mouth, and Princess of Glory finds out,

369
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:05,521
Promise An's father will definitely die.

370
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:09,467
Then...

371
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:19,000
Gong Gong, please don't tell His Majesty I came

372
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,041
Yes

373
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,634
It's hot outside. Young mistress, hurry and go back.

374
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:33,572
Don't be sad

375
00:22:34,268 --> 00:22:37,213
We will think of other ways

376
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:39,736
What else is there?

377
00:22:39,736 --> 00:22:42,329
If Mei Jiejie can't save him,

378
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:44,667
then others are in even less of a position to help.

379
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:46,847
Mei Jiejie has good reason

380
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:51,253
If she does this, Princess of Glory will want your father dead even more

381
00:22:52,482 --> 00:22:54,822
Then what should I do?

382
00:22:54,822 --> 00:23:00,763
Today His Majesty already ordered to have Jiang Wenqing executed

383
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:06,472
Tomorrow it will probably be my father

384
00:23:10,017 --> 00:23:11,500
Let's go beg the Empress

385
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:14,185
Empress?

386
00:23:20,478 --> 00:23:22,714
Respects to young mistresses

387
00:23:22,714 --> 00:23:25,976
Please notify the Empress that we wish to see her

388
00:23:25,976 --> 00:23:28,073
Your timing is unfortunate

389
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,400
Niang Niang went out

390
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,658
I remember that Niang Niang usually rises from her nap at this time

391
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:35,779
Niang Niang went to see the Emperor

392
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:37,807
Young mistresses rushed here on such a hot summer day

393
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:39,624
It must be for the same thing

394
00:23:40,812 --> 00:23:42,894
The Empress hears news so quickly

395
00:23:42,894 --> 00:23:44,732
She knew Jiejie and I would come beg her

396
00:23:44,732 --> 00:23:46,542
so she went to see His Majesty first?

397
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:49,044
I don't know when she will be back

398
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:51,589
Why don't you wait for her in the side hall?

399
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:53,262
The tea has already been prepared

400
00:23:53,262 --> 00:23:55,158
Thanks for your troubles, Auntie Jian Qiu

401
00:23:55,158 --> 00:23:56,114
Please

402
00:24:00,242 --> 00:24:01,912
The empress went to Qingzhen

403
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:08,075
Why would she go there in the middle of the day?

404
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:13,488
I heard that Empress went to plea for Promise An's father, An Bihuai

405
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:19,856
You mean to say, An Bihaui's failure to deliver the military provisions?

406
00:24:20,545 --> 00:24:23,846
Niang Niang's older brother General Nian is hard at work leading the war campaign

407
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:27,618
Meanwhile they can't even handle such a trivial task behind the front line

408
00:24:27,618 --> 00:24:30,732
No wonder His Majesty is upset

409
00:24:30,732 --> 00:24:35,908
But...Empress just paid him a visit

410
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:38,796
Perhaps Niang Niang should also make a trip?

411
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,593
Promise An is very close with Precious Smile and Precious Virtue?

412
00:24:45,088 --> 00:24:46,788
Like sisters

413
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,723
There're no sisters in the harem

414
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,034
just the weak depends on the strong

415
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,760
silly follows the smart

416
00:24:56,681 --> 00:25:00,380
Sisters today, enemies tomorrow

417
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,953
Smile on the face, knife in the back

418
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:07,634
Niang Niang is exactly right

419
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:14,622
Do you think it's better to govern the inner palace amicably

420
00:25:14,622 --> 00:25:16,344
or with an iron fist?

421
00:25:18,738 --> 00:25:21,593
I'm stupid...I really don't know these things.

422
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:26,776
Where there are many women, there will be many disputes

423
00:25:27,788 --> 00:25:32,427
schemes, tears, acting, troubles

424
00:25:33,516 --> 00:25:35,560
Peaceful waters on the surface

425
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,468
hide a turbulent undercurrent.

426
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:42,945
If I were in charge,

427
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:45,139
I would govern with an iron fist and iron heart!

428
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:50,418
who dare regardless of the rules under strict laws

429
00:25:51,514 --> 00:25:53,095
Niang Niang is right

430
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:57,687
Empress returns

431
00:26:04,418 --> 00:26:07,231
Respects to Empress

432
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:08,479
Everyone rise

433
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:09,337
Yes

434
00:26:13,964 --> 00:26:15,239
Sit

435
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,849
Thanks Empress

436
00:26:18,966 --> 00:26:26,044
I've already tried my hardest to plea for Promise An's father, but there's nothing I can do

437
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:30,632
His Majesty only said this an official matter, and nothing else

438
00:26:31,495 --> 00:26:35,839
Since Niang Niang puts it that way, then there's nothing to be done

439
00:26:37,613 --> 00:26:42,702
Under the current circumstances, it will depend on (1) your father's luck,

440
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:48,118
and (2) if there's still any room for discussion with His Majesty.

441
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:56,339
Lingrong thanks Empress for your care and concern

442
00:26:56,871 --> 00:27:00,634
I will always remember your favor

443
00:27:00,634 --> 00:27:02,743
Get up

444
00:27:02,743 --> 00:27:03,342
Yes

445
00:27:03,342 --> 00:27:05,774
Everyone has setbacks at some point in life

446
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:10,339
As the head of the inner palace

447
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:13,273
and as your sister in serving His Majesty,

448
00:27:13,273 --> 00:27:17,201
I should help you whenever I can.

449
00:27:19,978 --> 00:27:22,275
Whether this matter works out favorably or not,

450
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:23,702
we are endlessly grateful

451
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:25,850
for Empress's words.

452
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:28,755
Since I've entered the inner palace,

453
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,092
I've seen so many arbitrary things that Princess of Glory has done

454
00:27:32,092 --> 00:27:35,998
but Empress is so kind,

455
00:27:37,534 --> 00:27:38,735
I...

456
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,903
Precious Smile, you've always been understanding

457
00:27:42,903 --> 00:27:46,708
You should console Promise An on this matter, understand?

458
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:50,526
Niangniang's concern, I also appreciate

459
00:27:50,526 --> 00:27:52,911
How can I repay Empress's kindness?

460
00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:57,500
Conflicts are frequent in the inner palace

461
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,584
My body is weak, so I'm really tired of dealing with it

462
00:28:01,582 --> 00:28:05,738
Precious Smile are considerate, if you know what I want

463
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:09,358
you must be able to share my burden

464
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:24,426
It's so hot today, the ashes in the censer burn up again

465
00:28:24,426 --> 00:28:26,274
What should I do?

466
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,572
We concubines in the Inner Palace

467
00:28:49,572 --> 00:28:51,636
all depend Empress' kindness

468
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:53,548
It's my pleasure

469
00:28:53,548 --> 00:28:55,680
to share your burden

470
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,144
as the saying goes, wise man work with his mind

471
00:28:58,144 --> 00:29:00,730
I'm lowly, I can just repay Empress with my physical power

472
00:29:02,153 --> 00:29:06,090
Good, you haven't disappointed my hopes

473
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,804
The moon is bright, while the stars are sparse<br>a magpie fly to the south

474
00:29:11,804 --> 00:29:14,778
it circled the tree for many times, and finally find a branch to rest (depend on)

475
00:29:17,111 --> 00:29:21,939
Actually, in this inner palace, there has always been only one tree

476
00:29:21,939 --> 00:29:24,843
but many flowers are misleading

477
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:31,154
As long as you can distinguish which is a tree, which is a flower

478
00:29:31,154 --> 00:29:34,080
Many thanks for Empress's advice. I will remember closely.

479
00:29:39,922 --> 00:29:42,696
The Empress pleaing for An Bihuai before His Majesty...

480
00:29:42,696 --> 00:29:44,461
Princess of Glory already knows about it.

481
00:29:46,012 --> 00:29:49,272
At this moment, no one cares about the Empress more than Princess of Glory

482
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:53,122
Take a guess, what is Princess of Glory doing right now?

483
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:57,271
She must be doing the exact opposite of what Empress is doing,

484
00:29:57,271 --> 00:30:00,354
asking His Majesty to punish An Bihuai harshly.

485
00:30:00,354 --> 00:30:02,157
Then I should thank her

486
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,804
What does young mistress mean by that?

487
00:30:06,576 --> 00:30:08,606
Thank her for putting in so much effort

488
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:11,869
That way, it spares me much worry

489
00:30:50,752 --> 00:30:53,925
When did you come? I didn't realize you were here.

490
00:30:54,882 --> 00:30:57,790
Dear 4th was sleeping, I couldn't bear to disturb you

491
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,067
busy in public affairs

492
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,851
I read reports for a whole day

493
00:31:04,256 --> 00:31:09,666
Those old men have nothing better to do than bother me with reports. Really annoying.

494
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,868
As imperial officials, it's their duty

495
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:13,601
Dear 4th need not berate them

496
00:31:15,018 --> 00:31:18,512
Besides, beauties come at times

497
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,770
So Romatic, where is your toil from

498
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:27,069
It must be the woman's sleeve smells sweet,so poetic

499
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:33,293
It smells so good.

500
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:37,505
You are gliber, I connived you too much

501
00:31:39,686 --> 00:31:42,386
Princess of Glory understands you better than I do

502
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:45,413
I only know how to make you upset

503
00:31:53,575 --> 00:31:56,217
How do you know that Lady Hua Fei came?

504
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:01,850
The smell on the fan called Tian Gong Qiao

505
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:06,573
This kind of rouge smells overwhelmingly sweet, and is hard to make

506
00:32:06,573 --> 00:32:08,953
Not many people in the palace use it.

507
00:32:09,891 --> 00:32:11,609
Empress doesn't like fragrances

508
00:32:12,245 --> 00:32:15,054
I'm sure that when Princess of Glory comes to see Your Majesty,

509
00:32:15,054 --> 00:32:17,061
she dresses up with the utmost attention and detail,

510
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:20,858
even scenting her fan with rouge fragrance.

511
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:24,633
You have a keen sense of observation

512
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:26,836
Dear 4th, am I right?

513
00:32:26,836 --> 00:32:28,350
I can't hide anything from you

514
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:33,836
Right after the Empress left, Princess of Glory came.

515
00:32:33,836 --> 00:32:36,334
Both came for the same person.

516
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:38,067
For Promise An's father,

517
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:39,724
An Bihuai?

518
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,488
Exactly.

519
00:32:41,488 --> 00:32:45,231
Then what about you? <br><br>What did you come here for?

520
00:32:46,235 --> 00:32:48,210
Let Huan Huan venture a guess

521
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:51,271
The Empress is kind and generous

522
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:53,934
She must be pleaing for Promise An's father

523
00:32:53,934 --> 00:32:56,050
Princess of Glory is outspoken and tenacious

524
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,566
She must want Dear 4th to strictly enforce the law

525
00:32:58,566 --> 00:33:00,232
and not give into personal feelings.

526
00:33:00,232 --> 00:33:01,361
Then what about you?

527
00:33:01,361 --> 00:33:04,406
The inner palace must not interfere in politics, Huan Huan knows deeply in my heart

528
00:33:05,186 --> 00:33:07,103
It's just that it's strange.

529
00:33:07,103 --> 00:33:08,767
The Empress and Princess of Glory

530
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:11,424
both met with you regarding An Bihuai.

531
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,672
Is it really because they have opposing views...

532
00:33:14,137 --> 00:33:15,367
Or is this matter

533
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:18,207
itself deserves careful reconsideration?

534
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:19,279
What reconsideration?

535
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:27,117
When I was young, I read many history books

536
00:33:27,117 --> 00:33:29,639
I know that when wise Emperors punished the officials

537
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:32,739
they usually punished the head official and forgave the retinues, both strict and kind

538
00:33:32,739 --> 00:33:36,265
made others revere and appreciate

539
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:39,245
your majesty always admire the wise emperors of Tang ang Song dynasty

540
00:33:39,245 --> 00:33:41,055
your majesty are also a wise and kind emperor

541
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:44,037
I am ignorant

542
00:33:44,037 --> 00:33:46,676
but I think there are wars outside and imprisonment inside

543
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:49,043
distinguish them clearly so that the nation will be peaceful

544
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:54,370
I always thought you only read history books intensely

545
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:58,474
I didn't think you were also fluent in national policy

546
00:33:59,795 --> 00:34:05,260
none of your words interfered policy but each of them pointed it out through history

547
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:07,934
there is someone like you

548
00:34:07,934 --> 00:34:09,738
as if I find out a treasure

549
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:17,141
I will have someone reexamine An Bihuai's case. I won't let anyone suffer false accusations.

550
00:34:18,521 --> 00:34:20,707
As a woman

551
00:34:20,707 --> 00:34:22,200
I was too bold in front of your majesty

552
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,570
I beg Your Majesty to not take offense

553
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,261
The inner palace does not interfere in politics

554
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:30,418
When we are together alone,

555
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:32,196
I am your husband.

556
00:34:33,124 --> 00:34:37,220
A wife speaking her mind freely before her husband, about history and politics,

557
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:40,046
what's wrong with that?

558
00:34:40,046 --> 00:34:41,236
I don't dare.

559
00:34:41,236 --> 00:34:45,644
Precious Smile Zhen Shi dares not, but Zhen Huan may as well

560
00:34:52,112 --> 00:34:56,530
Yes, I dare not break the rules in front of your majesty

561
00:34:57,215 --> 00:35:00,444
but I will tell everything to my dear 4th

562
00:35:09,223 --> 00:35:11,803
Servant congratulates young mistress

563
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:14,000
Auntie is too polite. What is it?

564
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,595
This morning, His Majesty ordered Ji Zhou official Shen Zishan

565
00:35:16,595 --> 00:35:19,297
to reexamine Sir An's case.

566
00:35:19,297 --> 00:35:20,917
Sir An has hope

567
00:35:22,725 --> 00:35:23,573
Really?

568
00:35:23,573 --> 00:35:24,912
Of course.

569
00:35:24,912 --> 00:35:27,908
She went to the King herself to plead.

570
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:30,106
Of course, the King will not embarrass her and give her face.

571
00:35:30,842 --> 00:35:32,286
Thank you so much to the Queen.

572
00:35:32,286 --> 00:35:35,452
Don't, young mistress. Wait until Sir An is completely out of the woods.

573
00:35:35,452 --> 00:35:38,372
Please go yourself and thank my lady.

574
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:42,390
I think Precious Smile also went to plea with His Majesty yesterday

575
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,288
Precious Smile and Precious Virtue

576
00:35:45,288 --> 00:35:47,314
are really close sisters with you.

577
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:49,874
Sister Zhen indeed treats me sincerely

578
00:35:50,755 --> 00:35:52,476
But Sister Mei...

579
00:35:52,476 --> 00:35:55,517
Precious Shen has already written to Sir Shen

580
00:35:55,517 --> 00:35:57,612
asking him to look after this matter.

581
00:35:57,612 --> 00:36:01,844
Who wouldn't do a favor if it goes with the current?

582
00:36:01,844 --> 00:36:04,595
Actually, with Empress pleaing for leniency,

583
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,063
His Majesty would definitely forgive Sir An.

584
00:36:07,063 --> 00:36:11,538
But if Precious Shen was willing to write Sir Shen earlier,

585
00:36:11,538 --> 00:36:13,365
you wouldn't have to be so worried.

586
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:18,487
I still have other matters to attend to. I'll leave first.

587
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:19,801
Auntie go well

588
00:36:34,427 --> 00:36:37,119
Bao Juan!

589
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,355
Quickly find me some valuable things

590
00:36:40,355 --> 00:36:42,397
Throughout this whole ordeal,

591
00:36:42,397 --> 00:36:43,638
the family must have spent

592
00:36:43,638 --> 00:36:46,194
a good deal of money to save father.

593
00:36:46,194 --> 00:36:47,806
If I don't help them financially,

594
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:50,733
mother must be having a hard time at home.

595
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:54,854
Mother's eyes are not good, and she's constantly bullied by the other wives

596
00:36:56,491 --> 00:36:58,142
If Concubine Xiao didn't protect her,

597
00:36:59,364 --> 00:37:01,393
Then I wouldn't know what I'd do.

598
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:04,841
Fortunately, Precious Smile has given you quite a few gifts

599
00:37:04,841 --> 00:37:07,890
Young mistress can pick some good ones to send back home

600
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,498
So what if they're expensive goods.

601
00:37:10,498 --> 00:37:12,077
I finally know that

602
00:37:12,077 --> 00:37:16,056
No one's words can have as much use as the Queen's.

603
00:37:16,056 --> 00:37:18,253
But of course. Other than the Empress Dowager,

604
00:37:18,253 --> 00:37:21,384
the Empress is the most powerful woman in the palace.

605
00:37:21,384 --> 00:37:23,123
Through this experience,

606
00:37:23,123 --> 00:37:27,800
I know that nothing and no one can be relied on.

607
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,703
Mei Jiejie normally calls me sister,

608
00:37:30,703 --> 00:37:35,318
but when I need her help, she avoids me.

609
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:36,866
I believe that

610
00:37:36,866 --> 00:37:39,153
Precious Smile is sincere towards young mistress.

611
00:37:40,806 --> 00:37:43,809
Who treats me well, I know well inside my heart.

612
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:47,735
I believe that it's better to rely on oneself than on others.

613
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:50,452
If young mistress wants to make master and madam proud,

614
00:37:50,452 --> 00:37:53,050
it's better to win favor yourself, and hold your head high.

615
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,923
That's more satisfying

616
00:37:54,923 --> 00:37:58,376
But I don't have that ability.

617
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,027
And I don't have that chance.

618
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:03,412
But my lady, you have intentions. With intentions comes good opportunities.

619
00:38:17,658 --> 00:38:20,506
Young mistress fear the heat, but why don't you fan young mistress inside?

620
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,333
The King is inside. I don't dare stay there.

621
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,194
These noisy cicadas are keeping young mistress from sleeping well

622
00:38:25,194 --> 00:38:27,963
I came out here to chase them away!

623
00:38:27,963 --> 00:38:31,166
What's the use in only getting rid of these? There are plenty more outside in the garden.

624
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:32,716
It will only be quiet if they're all gone

625
00:38:33,774 --> 00:38:35,121
Eh, you're not staying with me?

626
00:38:36,077 --> 00:38:39,393
Young mistress asked me to pick some lilies. She wants to see them after her nap.

627
00:38:39,393 --> 00:38:40,759
I'm going to put them in a vase

628
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:51,875
I'm so sorry. I did not know the King was here.

629
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:54,111
It really was unintentional

630
00:38:54,111 --> 00:38:56,738
Young mistress, Huanbi didn't do it on purpose

631
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:03,046
You're that Huanbi who likes to wear green?

632
00:39:03,046 --> 00:39:05,774
Yes I am. The King has good memory.

633
00:39:09,796 --> 00:39:11,971
Put your things down. You may go.

634
00:39:11,971 --> 00:39:12,860
Yes.

635
00:39:30,591 --> 00:39:34,280
Why would you put the flower in the bowl?

636
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:39,718
I reply to the King, my thoughts are that if the flowers are floating instead of stuck in the vase

637
00:39:39,718 --> 00:39:41,369
they would look better.

638
00:39:43,334 --> 00:39:46,759
You are pretty, and also meticulous

639
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,119
Thank you my King.

640
00:39:56,985 --> 00:39:59,276
Of course, it's someone you've picked out.

641
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:08,890
<i>Thank you for watching!
