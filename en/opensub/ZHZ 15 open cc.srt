00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,889
<i> ~ Episode 15 ~

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,568
Auntie

3
00:00:08,568 --> 00:00:11,007
What's the matter? So rash

4
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:13,249
Nothing

5
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:19,485
I didn't listen to Princess of Glory regarding An Bihuai

6
00:00:20,268 --> 00:00:23,048
so she threw tantrums for a couple days.

7
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:25,336
I should do something to appease her

8
00:00:26,723 --> 00:00:30,665
I treat you differently from others

9
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:32,048
You know that

10
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:33,554
I dare not think that

11
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:36,826
When I think of Yushi and Pin of Beauty,

12
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:39,237
I'm still a bit frightened.

13
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,998
How could I not understand your thoughts?

14
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:49,062
Actually I want to promote you to Pin

15
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:52,076
but you have only been here a short while,

16
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:56,423
and I promoted you to Precious just after you served me.

17
00:00:57,365 --> 00:00:59,261
I've already gone against tradition

18
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:02,182
You'll just have to bear it for a few days

19
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:05,831
When you become pregnant then it will be justifiable

20
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:07,966
I don't care about status

21
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:09,926
as long as you have me in your heart

22
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:12,379
How could my heart not have you in it?

23
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,326
I care about you very much.

24
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,330
In the palace there are so many people and none of them allow me any peace

25
00:01:26,572 --> 00:01:29,543
Only at your place can I feel satisfied

26
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:33,210
I know

27
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,193
You went to see Mei older sister

28
00:01:37,193 --> 00:01:38,799
Has her appetite improved?

29
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:43,043
It's still the same. She still likes to eat sour foods

30
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:49,763
It would be good when you give birth to a white and chubby prince

31
00:01:49,763 --> 00:01:52,240
A prince is good, and a princess isn't?

32
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,530
As long as it is our kid, I will like it

33
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,223
Good evening your majesty, good evening Precious Smile

34
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:07,461
You may rise

35
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,809
Thank you your majesty

36
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:11,056
Lingrong, where are you going?

37
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:12,440
To see Mei older sister

38
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,718
What a coincidence, that is where his majesty and I are going

39
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,640
let's go together

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,418
yes

41
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:18,588
let's go

42
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:24,071
Hui Precious I see that your color is very good

43
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:26,092
I believe that this birth will be very safe and healthy

44
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:28,118
His majesty has arrived

45
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:31,542
May your majesty have peace

46
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:37,306
Today is such a coincidence you are all here

47
00:02:37,306 --> 00:02:38,853
Hui Precious is pregnant

48
00:02:38,853 --> 00:02:40,762
As the Center of Harem

49
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:44,729
It is my responsibility to care after the others as it is my duty

50
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:47,679
We follow the Empress

51
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:52,177
Get up, get up, come come come

52
00:02:55,064 --> 00:02:56,474
How is it

53
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:58,464
How are you feeling?

54
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:01,256
I think that everything is very well. Thank you your majesty

55
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:04,177
Has your majesty had dinner yet?

56
00:03:04,177 --> 00:03:06,565
A new chef has arrived in my palace

57
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:08,497
and made great dishes from Jian Nan

58
00:03:08,497 --> 00:03:10,870
I just had dinner at Bi Tong study

59
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,039
maybe some other day

60
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:17,335
Precious Smile's palace should also have a good chef

61
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:18,929
only that could give his majesty the incentive to stay

62
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:22,977
Princess of Glory, the Longan soup in your palace

63
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:25,466
already is unforgettable to his majesty

64
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,642
Now your palace as aquired a good chef

65
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:31,099
wouldn't his majesty's soul keep thinking about Princess of Glory?

66
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:33,689
Over a month I haven't chatted with Precious Smile

67
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:36,738
Wan Precious' speaking is as good as ever

68
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:42,043
She's young, clever and likes to joke around

69
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:45,429
Must you argue with her?

70
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:50,864
Your Majesty, I like Precious Smile's wit

71
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,107
I was just joking with her

72
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:58,775
Your Majesty, General Yili gave us some honeydew melons as presents

73
00:03:58,775 --> 00:04:00,393
Let's try them together

74
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:01,880
Alright

75
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:06,192
Your Majesty, it's time to flip a plaque

76
00:04:07,443 --> 00:04:10,732
Not necessary, I'm going to the Empress's

77
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:16,030
If you have more honeydew melons at your place, I will eat them there

78
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,258
Yes

79
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:24,063
Precious Smile, keep Precious Virtue company

80
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,188
Yes

81
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:43,133
Who's creeping around there?

82
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:47,232
We see you! Quick, come out!

83
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:48,312
Don't take me!

84
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:49,659
I serve Precious Virtue!

85
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,203
This...

86
00:04:55,203 --> 00:04:57,305
Isn't she fleaing from Precious Virtue's palace?

87
00:04:57,305 --> 00:04:59,310
Why is she sneaking around here?

88
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:08,359
What do you have in your hands?

89
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:10,106
What is this?

90
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:12,339
What?

91
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:16,014
Want to steal and run away with young mistress's things?

92
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:21,248
What a disappointing servant! Quickly drag her out!

93
00:05:21,248 --> 00:05:23,630
You're pregnant. No need to upset yourself.

94
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:27,064
Young mistress, save me!

95
00:05:27,064 --> 00:05:28,546
How do you expect me to tolerate

96
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:31,134
you doing such a thing? Hurry, go!

97
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:33,396
Wait!

98
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:34,502
This...

99
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:38,946
This...What is this?!

100
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:40,495
Blood!

101
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:43,610
Why do these pants have blood on them?

102
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,065
Did someone commit murder?

103
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:48,494
This is strange

104
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:54,983
Why didn't she steal something more valuable?

105
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:58,029
Only filthy pants and skirts?

106
00:05:59,507 --> 00:06:01,772
Do these belong to Precious Virtue?

107
00:06:01,772 --> 00:06:04,144
Why are they stained with blood?

108
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,994
Could it be...that Precious Virtue has her period?

109
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:14,258
I didn't

110
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:17,435
Your Majesty, this girl is acting very strange

111
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:20,602
I think she should be taken to the Bureau of Cautious Punishment

112
00:06:20,602 --> 00:06:22,893
for a thorough interrogation.

113
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:24,728
Such dirty hands

114
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:26,499
Quickly drag her out to be beaten!

115
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:28,456
Young mistress

116
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:32,113
Young mistress...servant was destroying evidence for you!

117
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:35,348
But instead you will heartlessly see me die!

118
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:39,369
Why should I stay loyal to you?

119
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:43,281
Your Majesty!

120
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:45,825
Under the circumstances, servant dares not hide anymore from Your Majesty

121
00:06:47,035 --> 00:06:49,663
Young mistress is actually not pregnant at all!

122
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:52,856
I didn't steal these clothes either

123
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:56,306
Young mistress had her period several days ago

124
00:06:56,306 --> 00:06:59,279
She stained her underpants and told me to dispose of them!

125
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,081
These clothes are irrefutable evidence!

126
00:07:02,193 --> 00:07:03,267
Sister

127
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:11,392
Your Majesty...she...she is slandering me!

128
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:16,637
Precious Virtue has been startled. Quickly get the imperial doctor here.

129
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:17,259
Yes

130
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:18,956
Su Gong Gong

131
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:21,944
Please get Doctor Liu who has been caring for my pregnancy

132
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:25,625
But, I don't know if he's on call tonight

133
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,021
Replying to young mistress,

134
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:29,267
Imperial Doctor Liu is not on call tonight.

135
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:31,407
Not a big deal if he isn't

136
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:34,188
Get the head of the imperial hospital, Zhang Ni

137
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,309
Yes

138
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:38,084
Your Majesty...but my pregnancy has always been in the care of Doctor Liu

139
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:40,550
Doesn't matter!

140
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,792
They're all the same!

141
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,824
Imperial Doctor Zhang, what is the situation? Was the fetus startled?

142
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:31,938
Your Majesties, forgive me

143
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:36,632
Precious Shen...she has no signs of pregnancy

144
00:08:36,632 --> 00:08:40,247
Nonsense! The child is perfectly fine, how could I not be pregnant?!

145
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:41,839
Sister, calm down

146
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,158
Maybe the doctor made a mistake in his diagnosis

147
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,709
I do not have divine power

148
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:49,494
If I may recommend

149
00:08:49,494 --> 00:08:54,125
Please ask imperial Doctor Jiang to confirm

150
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,374
Get him!

151
00:08:55,374 --> 00:08:56,261
Yes

152
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:28,057
Replying to Your Majesty, young mistress is not pregnant

153
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:31,875
I don't know which imperial doctor diagnosed young mistress as pregnant

154
00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:35,233
You're wrong! Young mistress didn't have her period

155
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:38,128
She vomits and also craves sour foods. Aren't those signs of pregnancy?

156
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:40,298
But in my humble opinion,

157
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:42,994
young mistress should have had her period in the past couple days.

158
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:45,510
Her period is just irregular and came late

159
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:49,381
It should be the result of taking medicine

160
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,773
Several months ago, Precious Virtue asked me

161
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:55,277
for a prescription to delay her period.

162
00:09:55,277 --> 00:09:58,864
She said her periods were irregular, causing difficulty conceiving

163
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,174
Although I was hesitant,

164
00:10:01,174 --> 00:10:04,826
young mistress kept on saying it was for the sake of Your Majesty's posterity.

165
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:08,805
I had no choice but to give her the prescription

166
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:11,742
As for why young mistress vomits and like sour foods,

167
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:14,775
that I don't know.

168
00:10:16,946 --> 00:10:21,280
Your Majesty, I did secretly ask imperial Doctor Jiang for a prescription,

169
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,639
but this prescription was to help with conceiving, not postpone my period!

170
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,315
I've been falsely accused!

171
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:28,796
Where's the prescription?

172
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,034
Everything will be clear from the paper

173
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:35,092
Caiyue

174
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:38,228
Get the prescription from the bottom of the makeup box

175
00:10:42,635 --> 00:10:47,135
Your Majesty, I know that secret dealings violate palace rules

176
00:10:47,135 --> 00:10:49,417
Please forgive me!

177
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:52,415
Yes, engaging in secret dealings

178
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:55,262
is a much smaller crime than faking pregnancy to gain favor.

179
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:58,560
Young mistress, it's not here!

180
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,963
Stop looking!

181
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:08,686
Su Pei Sheng

182
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:09,636
Servant here

183
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:13,840
Go find Liu Ben

184
00:11:14,648 --> 00:11:17,339
If he dares delay, immediately tie him up!

185
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:18,762
Replying to Your Majesty,

186
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,257
when I went to ask for imperial doctor Jiang,

187
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:24,096
I also ordered someone to get imperial doctor Liu.

188
00:11:24,096 --> 00:11:27,978
But doctor Liu has already vacated his residence

189
00:11:31,573 --> 00:11:33,556
Great

190
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:39,693
Precious Shen, you're both from the same town right?

191
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:46,772
You recommended him to care for the pregnancy, right?

192
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:48,411
Your Majesty

193
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:52,338
Whoever speaks for Precious Shen will receive the same punishment

194
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,116
Your Majesty

195
00:11:55,585 --> 00:12:00,085
Your Majesty, Precious Smile and Precious Virtue have long been good friends

196
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:01,541
Who knows if today's incident...

197
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,712
Shut up!

198
00:12:05,869 --> 00:12:08,192
Your Majesty, please calm down

199
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,562
You deceived me and the Empress Dowager

200
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,805
You still dare wear and show off this hairpin?

201
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:33,256
Your Majesty, your health is of utmost importance

202
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:54,919
I have always liked how steady you were

203
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:59,353
I never thought you would succumb this easily

204
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:01,052
to fake a pregnancy to gain favor

205
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,062
I am so disappointed

206
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:10,750
You majesty I am innocent

207
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:14,314
I really am innocent!

208
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:18,432
Your majesty, I grew up with older sister

209
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:21,560
The type of person older sister is I am more sure about than anything

210
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,978
Although she was wrong today

211
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:25,920
because of her loyalty to you

212
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,131
Please giver her a chance to redeem herself

213
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:32,060
Please think about it again

214
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,760
Please forgive Precious Shen your majesty

215
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:44,226
Precious Smile's words are logical

216
00:13:44,226 --> 00:13:47,273
Precious Shen was just to eagar to have an heir

217
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:49,079
Please look to your past feelings your majesty

218
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:59,658
Precious Shen

219
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:02,214
Your words are not reliable

220
00:14:02,214 --> 00:14:07,407
Your status will be lowered to Promise and your title will be taken away

221
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:10,021
you will be put in Xian Yue Ge

222
00:14:10,021 --> 00:14:12,999
Without my permission, no one may visit

223
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:21,532
Please direct me your majesty. What of Liu Ben and Fu Ling

224
00:14:21,532 --> 00:14:24,007
Chase Liu Ben... catch him alive

225
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:27,608
Fu Ling... Kill

226
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:35,549
Sister!

227
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,478
How could this happen?

228
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:47,100
How could this happen, Bao Jian?

229
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,528
I'm so scared... Sister's situation would cause harm to us, right?

230
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:51,566
It''s okay, it's okay

231
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:53,106
At least Precious Smile is still here

232
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:58,094
Go quick. This

233
00:14:58,094 --> 00:14:59,105
This

234
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:01,024
Quick, go burn it

235
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:02,402
Young mistress embroidered this for days

236
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,355
are we really going to just burn it?

237
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:06,364
The Emperor is investigating the fake pregnancy case

238
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,436
If this was discovered

239
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:09,202
It would bring ruin us

240
00:15:09,202 --> 00:15:10,713
Go! Quickly, quickly

241
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:34,341
It has been done. Money

242
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:35,583
You'll have your share

243
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:41,662
Five thousand taels in paper curency. It is enough for the rest of your life

244
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:42,581
Go ahead and count

245
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:46,772
Just these taels

246
00:15:46,772 --> 00:15:48,897
Is only enough for me to use in half a year

247
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:18,146
What?! Liu Ben escaped?!

248
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:21,125
Please calm down your majesty. Servant has already sent people to chase him

249
00:16:24,753 --> 00:16:27,536
After they catch up to him, kill him without question

250
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:29,610
Liu Ben knows too much about us

251
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,201
There's no way we can leave him alive

252
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:32,441
Yes

253
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:33,675
Your majesty

254
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,321
You may get up

255
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:40,101
Thank you your majesty

256
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:42,951
Are the members of Fu Ling's family all set to go?

257
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:44,001
In reply your majesty

258
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:46,896
Servant has already given enough money and sent it to Re He

259
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:50,412
That is good

260
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,758
I had agreed to Fu Ling's request

261
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:57,355
If this plan did not succeed, her entire family would die.

262
00:16:57,355 --> 00:16:59,025
If it went well

263
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:00,725
even if she died

264
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:03,547
I would make sure that her family would be showered in riches

265
00:17:04,368 --> 00:17:05,829
Your majesty is wise. For Fu Ling to die for you

266
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:09,449
Your majesty would ensure her family's well being

267
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:12,504
Fu Ling's death is worth it

268
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:14,664
You may leave

269
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:15,653
Yes

270
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:25,400
He's coming

271
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:27,265
Zhang Gong Gong

272
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,655
Auspicious greetings, Promise An

273
00:17:30,655 --> 00:17:32,125
You are being welcome

274
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,288
Zhang Gong Gong, you promised us yesterday

275
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:36,949
that you would bring young mistress' four bags back to her home

276
00:17:36,949 --> 00:17:39,454
We prepared them. Sorry to bother you

277
00:17:40,211 --> 00:17:43,591
Miss, I'm really sorry

278
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:45,268
What I agreed yesterday

279
00:17:45,268 --> 00:17:46,739
I can't carry out today

280
00:17:48,505 --> 00:17:50,532
Gong Gong, a private word please

281
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:52,947
Is twenty taels of silver not enough?

282
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,269
If it is about that, I'll go back and get more

283
00:17:56,269 --> 00:17:59,013
Young Mistress, in the course of one night

284
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:02,110
Many things have turned the world upside down

285
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,469
Precious Shen became Promise Shen

286
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:09,260
Your bag... Servant is honestly scared to deliver it

287
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,223
Hey! Zhang Gong Gong, Zhang Gong Gong

288
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,324
How can you go back on your word?

289
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:15,682
At least, our Precious Smile is still here

290
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:18,232
It's not that I am going back on my word

291
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:21,005
Anyone who gets involved with Promise Shen will become taboo

292
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:22,802
I don't want to get involved

293
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,862
Then again, Promise Shen has fallen

294
00:18:25,862 --> 00:18:29,422
How can Precious Smile not be dragged down

295
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:30,562
The way I see it

296
00:18:30,562 --> 00:18:33,127
it just like a rabbit's tail -- not long

297
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:35,744
Alright Gonggong, let's come to the point

298
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:39,873
How can these things be sent to my mother

299
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,839
You give me half of these

300
00:18:50,277 --> 00:18:52,829
Be careful<br>Quickly

301
00:18:54,537 --> 00:18:58,511
This, and that one. Quickly

302
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:04,558
These things are mine

303
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:06,207
Why are you taking them out

304
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:09,126
Promise An, our Niangniang said,

305
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:11,538
you came here with Promise Shen

306
00:19:11,538 --> 00:19:15,684
According to your status, you shouldn't have lived in such a good room

307
00:19:15,684 --> 00:19:19,579
Thanks to Niangniang is kind, you don't have to move out

308
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:22,997
but these furnishings

309
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:26,307
are of no use to you

310
00:19:26,307 --> 00:19:28,525
and you are also not qualified to use them

311
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:30,744
Niangniang said, we should move out all of these

312
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:34,183
They are just needed

313
00:19:34,183 --> 00:19:35,723
in these servants' rooms

314
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:38,288
We can just take yours

315
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:41,033
Let us go

316
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:49,685
Foul-mouth's Promise Shen

317
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:52,564
We didn't get any benefit whe Promise Shen was favoured

318
00:19:52,564 --> 00:19:54,994
Now she has become a Promise, everyone tramples on her

319
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,783
but we have to accompany, what the hell

320
00:19:57,783 --> 00:20:00,726
Enough, keep it yourself

321
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,739
Young mistress, why are you still here. Please go back

322
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:16,710
The northwestern war is intense

323
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,148
Except the imperial court, his majesty stays in the hall of policy all the time

324
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:21,655
reading the booklet

325
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:23,465
or meeting the ministers

326
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:25,017
has no time for you

327
00:20:26,346 --> 00:20:29,883
Thank Su Gonggong. I'd like to wait some more

328
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:34,556
Servant know young mistress is worry about Promise Shen

329
00:20:34,556 --> 00:20:37,028
but you can't disregard your own health.

330
00:20:44,627 --> 00:20:46,134
Young mistress, take this

331
00:20:46,134 --> 00:20:47,516
Thanks Su Gonggong

332
00:20:53,495 --> 00:20:55,579
The weather is so hot

333
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:57,450
but it is cool inside

334
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:00,712
Precious Smile

335
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:03,137
why are you standing in the sun

336
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,563
Are you mildewed (having bad luck)

337
00:21:05,563 --> 00:21:07,775
and have to bask to get it back ?

338
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:11,165
Wish Princess of Glory safe and lucky

339
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:12,837
Once the evildoers are eliminated

340
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:15,287
I will certainly be safe and lucky

341
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:16,451
Get up

342
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:22,991
Isn't his majesty busy in political issues

343
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,365
Yes

344
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:26,951
The northwestern war is not over yet

345
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:29,591
so his majesty is concerning about my brother

346
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:31,751
My brother's letter has just arrived

347
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:34,125
I have to tell everything to his majesty

348
00:21:36,155 --> 00:21:37,492
Thanks Niangniang for telling me these

349
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,188
but whether his majesty has time now

350
00:21:42,328 --> 00:21:44,607
Precious Cao and Wenyi are inside

351
00:21:50,124 --> 00:21:52,116
Precious Smile

352
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:56,633
Are you going to plead for Shen Meizhuang

353
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,293
His majesty has been bothered for several days

354
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:02,623
right now Wenyi is accompanying

355
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:05,291
so he can be a little pleased

356
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,980
Once you are in

357
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,093
no matter whether you will mention Shen Meizhuang or not

358
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:12,623
you will remind his majesty of her false pregnancy

359
00:22:13,543 --> 00:22:16,667
his majesty will be more angry

360
00:22:19,689 --> 00:22:22,867
I believe Sister Mei can't do this

361
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:27,064
Whether his majesty trusts you or what he saw

362
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:32,013
His majesty didn't kill Shen Meizhuang,it's her luck

363
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:35,900
She dared to play with the dragon's offspring

364
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,858
then she will wait to die in the palaces

365
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:44,306
The sun is so bright

366
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:45,695
Songzi<br>Yes

367
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:46,756
Back

368
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:57,215
Su gonggong, please inform my coming once more

369
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:11,800
your majesty, Precious Smile is still waiting outside

370
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:16,954
Your majesty, let Precious Smile in

371
00:23:16,954 --> 00:23:20,726
the sun is so bright outside, Precious Smile is worred obout Promise Shen

372
00:23:20,726 --> 00:23:22,451
I'm afraid she will get sunstroke

373
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:26,870
If she gets sick, Promise Shen wii be worried

374
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,894
and can't calm and repent

375
00:23:28,894 --> 00:23:33,600
The song you just sang souds good, sing it once more to Wenyi

376
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,596
Yes

377
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:45,145
Shaking and shaking, little baby, sleep quickly

378
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:53,725
Young mistress, his majesty doesn't want to listen

379
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:56,401
or want to think about Promise Shen's situation

380
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:59,128
I think, you should just go back

381
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:01,832
Thanks Gonggong

382
00:24:07,797 --> 00:24:10,845
Young mistress, how about we go beg Empress Dowager

383
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:15,947
Younger sister must think it through

384
00:24:15,947 --> 00:24:18,298
If you're health were to deteriorate

385
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:20,400
in the future if you were to be vindicated

386
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,319
you wouldn't be able to be happy

387
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:26,677
Thank you sister, for being brave enough to come take care of me

388
00:24:28,006 --> 00:24:31,100
We shared a palace. With this type of incident

389
00:24:31,628 --> 00:24:34,268
It is also because I wasn't able to properly care for you

390
00:24:34,784 --> 00:24:39,078
Now, only I can come here occasionally

391
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:43,644
Although Precious Smile is worried about you, with all those guards outside

392
00:24:43,644 --> 00:24:45,934
It is difficult for her to enter

393
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:48,803
You must tell her that she must take care of herself

394
00:24:48,803 --> 00:24:52,424
and not upset his majesty trying to help me

395
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,520
Young sister, even if I were to nag her thousands of times

396
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,773
It would not be as good as you keeping your own body healthy.

397
00:25:00,146 --> 00:25:03,249
If something were to happen to you, Precious Smile would be hurt too

398
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:10,441
Then, I should eat a little

399
00:25:26,956 --> 00:25:28,604
Young mistress should stop ripping the Lotus

400
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,364
There are only 2 parts left

401
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:34,922
If it's messed up it's a shame

402
00:25:36,944 --> 00:25:38,614
Things have developed to this stage

403
00:25:38,614 --> 00:25:40,287
How could I not be worried?

404
00:25:42,182 --> 00:25:45,192
Pin of Respects is not a hard-hearted person

405
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:47,190
I think she will take care of it

406
00:25:48,886 --> 00:25:51,088
Sister Mei was originally highly favored

407
00:25:51,088 --> 00:25:53,466
but now she's suddenly lost favor for committing a crime.

408
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:55,287
Even if His Majesty doesn't treat her harshly,

409
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,398
what about others in the palace?

410
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,951
Who knows how the others have insulted Sister Mei

411
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:03,842
Sister Mei is also so strong-willed

412
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:05,967
- What if she takes it too hard...<br>- Young mistress

413
00:26:06,855 --> 00:26:08,929
Let me speak

414
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:12,024
Why don't you go beg Auntie Fang Ruo?

415
00:26:12,024 --> 00:26:14,231
She used to be your instructor

416
00:26:14,231 --> 00:26:15,869
Right now she serves up front

417
00:26:26,158 --> 00:26:29,382
Secretly give this to her for me

418
00:26:29,382 --> 00:26:32,669
Say that I beg her help to take good care of Meizhuang

419
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:34,119
Alright

420
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:37,005
On my table get a tube of makeup for Fang Rong

421
00:26:37,005 --> 00:26:38,409
say that up front

422
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:40,151
Her eyebrow doesn't look good

423
00:26:40,151 --> 00:26:41,132
Young mistress

424
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:42,578
Go

425
00:26:47,218 --> 00:26:48,385
The food is cold

426
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:50,781
Let's have them bring more hot food

427
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:52,027
No need

428
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,507
The Internal Affairs Authority only allows the kitchen to bring meals once a day

429
00:26:58,192 --> 00:27:00,290
This is really strict imprisonment

430
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,456
Even I can't bring anything in

431
00:27:05,383 --> 00:27:06,594
Hey, wait

432
00:27:07,497 --> 00:27:09,731
You just said this food

433
00:27:09,731 --> 00:27:12,353
Was ordered by the Internal Affairs Authority?

434
00:27:12,353 --> 00:27:14,440
Yes

435
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,310
We must be careful of others

436
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:45,148
Toxic

437
00:27:47,845 --> 00:27:49,366
What's wrong?

438
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:53,348
No, it's nothing. Promise Shen just accidentally dropped the bowl. Go

439
00:27:56,354 --> 00:27:57,512
Young mistress

440
00:27:58,808 --> 00:28:01,288
Young mistress, there's news from the House of Respectful Affairs

441
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:03,912
Apparently last night, his majesty went to Princess Glory

442
00:28:12,303 --> 00:28:14,576
The closer his majesty gets to her

443
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:17,234
The more he will dislike Mei sister

444
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:20,456
I'm afraid that his majesty is even suspicious of me these days

445
00:28:20,456 --> 00:28:22,001
So that's why it's been so long since he's visited

446
00:28:23,447 --> 00:28:26,394
Maybe... his majesty is really busy with court dealings

447
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:28,368
Also, his majesty is the one by your side at night

448
00:28:28,368 --> 00:28:29,927
Normally he is very trusting with you

449
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:33,380
If his majesty honestly believed me

450
00:28:34,374 --> 00:28:36,112
After he dealt with Mei sister

451
00:28:36,112 --> 00:28:38,028
He would've rushed to see me

452
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:39,965
He wouldn't ignore me

453
00:28:41,682 --> 00:28:43,335
His majesty is the one next to my pillow

454
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:45,845
But he is also at other people's pillows

455
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,406
There is no difference between me and the others

456
00:28:59,936 --> 00:29:01,007
Sister

457
00:29:02,751 --> 00:29:05,371
His majesty is afraid that I'll ruin the royal reputation

458
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:11,061
So, he this is how he wants to deal with me

459
00:29:11,061 --> 00:29:13,046
No, that's not it sister

460
00:29:13,046 --> 00:29:15,995
His majesty wouldn't be this cruel

461
00:29:15,995 --> 00:29:18,571
He still cares about your family's influence and position

462
00:29:20,795 --> 00:29:23,106
You are from my palace

463
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:24,797
If you died

464
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:28,015
it would be said that you committed suicide because of your guilt

465
00:29:28,015 --> 00:29:29,795
and I would also get involved

466
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:33,691
The person who wants to harm us

467
00:29:34,843 --> 00:29:36,460
there is only one in this palace

468
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:42,337
Sister is saying.. Princess Glory?

469
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:46,559
Her vicious ways, I know best

470
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:52,096
That year, she avoided me and hated me so much

471
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:54,246
Using various methods to torment me

472
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,723
SIster, you have to tell his majesty for me

473
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:04,889
But in front of his majesty, I...

474
00:30:05,857 --> 00:30:10,734
am a person whose words are not worth listening to and have no influence

475
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:14,221
If they really wanted to harm you

476
00:30:14,221 --> 00:30:16,956
They must have plans to make it seem like you killed yourself due to guilt

477
00:30:16,956 --> 00:30:19,711
By reporting it, it is only going to alert the enemy

478
00:30:19,711 --> 00:30:22,612
Then

479
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:26,004
Then my food...

480
00:30:26,004 --> 00:30:27,605
Not only your food

481
00:30:27,605 --> 00:30:29,372
From now on you have to contantly be vigilant

482
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:31,604
and make sure no one tampered with anything

483
00:30:31,604 --> 00:30:33,701
I will tell the Empress

484
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:36,677
and ask her if your food can be made here

485
00:30:36,677 --> 00:30:38,406
it will be less work for the palace as well

486
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:41,592
Thank you sister for saving my life

487
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:44,607
What happened today

488
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:49,539
I ask that sister will not tell Precious Smile

489
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:52,477
Just in case she won't be able to control herself

490
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:54,727
Protecting you

491
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,079
is the same as protecting myself

492
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:01,975
I know what I should do at Precious Smile's place

493
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:27,398
Your majesty, becareful it's hot

494
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:35,664
Your eyebrows are drawn as far mountains

495
00:31:35,664 --> 00:31:37,009
Yes

496
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:40,758
Yes, maid had served the Empress and did it for her

497
00:31:40,758 --> 00:31:42,542
so I know how to do it myself

498
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,304
Greetings Precious Smile

499
00:31:58,304 --> 00:32:02,411
Report to young mistress; his majesty said he will come over tonight. Please prepare yourself

500
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:03,465
you've worked hard gong gong

501
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:04,518
Servant is leaving

502
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,936
Finally his majesty is coming

503
00:32:09,936 --> 00:32:14,262
Young mistress, do you want to bring up Mei mistress' problem and persuade him?

504
00:32:14,262 --> 00:32:17,078
At this time, I am more afraid to say anything

505
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:21,085
I can only wait until his anger subsides, and slowly bring him around

506
00:32:21,976 --> 00:32:25,763
In this event, protecting yourself is the right thing

507
00:32:25,763 --> 00:32:28,336
If I could help her, how could I not say anything?

508
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:31,481
A couple days ago I lost my temper

509
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:33,031
You saw how the people in the palace

510
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:35,722
were eager for me me to lose it again and go beg his majesty

511
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:37,414
and want his majesty to get rid of me too

512
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,059
How can I satisfy them?

513
00:32:41,595 --> 00:32:45,087
If only there was evidence that Mei mistress was innocent,

514
00:32:46,192 --> 00:32:48,769
I know that Mei mistress was framed

515
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:50,363
But we have no evidence

516
00:32:50,363 --> 00:32:52,638
Even if I had plan it wouldn't work

517
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,569
That reminds me Liu Zhu

518
00:32:55,569 --> 00:32:59,138
You go tell Xiao Yun Zi to go find Wen Shi chu

519
00:32:59,138 --> 00:33:00,870
Tell him to bring my letter

520
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,348
go to Zhen Fu

521
00:33:02,348 --> 00:33:04,637
and Mei sister's relatives' home

522
00:33:04,637 --> 00:33:06,625
Tell them that they must find Liu Ben for me

523
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,611
I want to see his body or his corpse

524
00:33:10,262 --> 00:33:11,684
I don't believe

525
00:33:11,684 --> 00:33:14,203
That a big living person, can escape without a trace

526
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:16,820
Yes, maid will definitely do a good job

527
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:25,368
Huang Gui Quan has really become well off

528
00:33:25,368 --> 00:33:27,683
He has the nerve to put these kinds of flowers in my palace

529
00:33:27,683 --> 00:33:30,264
These lowly people only go where the wind is blowing

530
00:33:30,264 --> 00:33:31,924
Seeing Mei mistress lose her status

531
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:36,000
and the majesty not coming here anymore... he dares to bring this junk

532
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,212
I'll take it out later

533
00:33:37,212 --> 00:33:39,687
so young mistress won't be irritated

534
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:41,560
My place is so empty

535
00:33:42,548 --> 00:33:44,238
you don't even have to mention older sister's place

536
00:33:46,647 --> 00:33:49,650
Tomorrow before the sun rises, place the pomegranate flower

537
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,762
In the showiest place

538
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:53,923
So it will remind me not to forget today's resolution

539
00:34:04,354 --> 00:34:07,147
If his majesty hasn't arrived at this time, he probably won't come

540
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:10,714
How about you rest first, young mistress

541
00:34:14,164 --> 00:34:15,428
That's not necessary

542
00:34:20,444 --> 00:34:22,157
Wishing his majesty much wealth and health

543
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:30,103
I am very annoyed

544
00:34:37,254 --> 00:34:38,719
Have some soup your majesty

545
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:47,207
This soup has been treated with ice but it's not cold

546
00:34:47,207 --> 00:34:50,283
It's night. Eating cold items will harm your body

547
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:55,403
Mistress had put in two pots of jasmine

548
00:34:55,403 --> 00:34:57,667
That way your majesty wil feel soothed

549
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,989
You don't have anything else to say to me?

550
00:35:19,021 --> 00:35:20,788
Now, the weather is really hot

551
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:25,100
Gold colored is too obvious

552
00:35:25,843 --> 00:35:28,867
yet light colored can't be spotted

553
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:31,412
Dear 4th, help me think

554
00:35:32,104 --> 00:35:35,577
Should I use the coral or the jet black?

555
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,656
This is your important matter?

556
00:35:39,656 --> 00:35:41,163
Girls care about appearances a lot

557
00:35:41,163 --> 00:35:42,857
Isn't it important?

558
00:35:45,373 --> 00:35:48,470
It is indeed the most important

559
00:35:49,468 --> 00:35:51,436
In my opinion,

560
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:54,457
use the coral.

561
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:57,724
Huan Huan is as pale as snow

562
00:35:59,126 --> 00:36:04,113
If the brows are a little red, you will appear more lively and cute

563
00:36:04,113 --> 00:36:05,435
Many thanks Dear 4th

564
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:10,172
You're not going to plea for Precious Shen?

565
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,907
As distance tests a horse's strength, so time reveals a person's heart

566
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:19,297
If there is an ending, there must be experience

567
00:36:19,297 --> 00:36:21,539
Then why do you insist on seeing me?

568
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:24,453
Dear 4th hasn't seen me in several days

569
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:27,594
Can't I come see you first?

570
00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:30,252
Everyone says that you are close to Precious Shen

571
00:36:31,184 --> 00:36:34,198
You must have been implicated by her incident

572
00:36:34,805 --> 00:36:38,953
Why don't you vindicate yourself?

573
00:36:38,953 --> 00:36:40,767
Though lies, if repeated often enough, will be accepted as truth,

574
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:44,175
Dear 4th is a wise ruler who also understands my nature.

575
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:46,214
Of course you wouldn't believe those one-sided statements

576
00:36:47,523 --> 00:36:49,788
If Dear 4th really doubted me,

577
00:36:49,788 --> 00:36:51,247
I wouldn't be able

578
00:36:51,247 --> 00:36:53,525
to have this chat with you right now.

579
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:54,178
Right?

580
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,408
Are you that confident

581
00:36:56,408 --> 00:36:58,401
I don't have the slightest doubt towards you?

582
00:36:58,401 --> 00:37:00,354
Dear 4th is my pillow mate

583
00:37:00,354 --> 00:37:02,452
If I can't even believe my own pillow mate,

584
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:05,744
then who can I believe and rely on?

585
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:22,549
Dear 4th has already made up his mind about Sister Mei

586
00:37:22,549 --> 00:37:25,169
There's not much I can say about the matter

587
00:37:25,169 --> 00:37:27,474
Didn't you already make that clear?

588
00:37:27,474 --> 00:37:29,107
After Princess of Glory's favor is restored,

589
00:37:29,107 --> 00:37:31,921
I might have to suffer a little.

590
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:33,719
I won't put you in a difficult position

591
00:37:38,207 --> 00:37:43,100
Lately Dear 4th has been busy with official affairs. Go to sleep.

592
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:53,161
Empress, I woke up early to hear

593
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:55,238
that Huang Guiquan got into trouble.

594
00:37:55,238 --> 00:37:58,242
He was sent to serve in the Bureau of Cautious Punishment

595
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:02,158
Of course. He can't even take care of small things.

596
00:38:02,158 --> 00:38:05,148
This morning, when His Majesty left Precious Smile's place,

597
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:07,558
he saw a row of withered flowers head-on.

598
00:38:07,558 --> 00:38:09,952
He became angry and sent him away

599
00:38:09,952 --> 00:38:12,214
And I was wondering what huge offense he had committed

600
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:14,984
Let him return in several days

601
00:38:14,984 --> 00:38:17,151
These palace matters are never trivial

602
00:38:17,151 --> 00:38:20,138
He may neglect flowers and plants today

603
00:38:20,138 --> 00:38:23,063
Then in the future it may grow and

604
00:38:23,063 --> 00:38:26,856
He will even begin to insult and sneer at his masters

605
00:38:27,831 --> 00:38:32,800
I know that Huang Guiquan is your distant relative which is why I must make an example of him even more.

606
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:36,530
Sister you are kind-hearted. You don't think it's a big deal.

607
00:38:37,327 --> 00:38:39,003
But in others' eyes,

608
00:38:39,003 --> 00:38:42,719
Huang Guiquan abuses his power in your name.

609
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:45,564
In the end, not to mention your reputation,

610
00:38:45,564 --> 00:38:47,702
is this worth upsetting His Majesty

611
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:50,823
and alienating him over?

612
00:38:51,692 --> 00:38:55,075
I just think that Huang Guiquan is used to managing the Internal Affairs Authority

613
00:38:55,075 --> 00:38:56,894
There is no one else to replace him in such short time

614
00:38:56,894 --> 00:39:00,327
I just brought it up casually, no other intention

615
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:03,493
That's exactly why he must be removed cleanly

616
00:39:03,493 --> 00:39:06,328
to avoid tarnishing Sister's reputation.

617
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,936
Of course, the Internal Affairs Authority must have someone in charge

618
00:39:10,936 --> 00:39:13,075
I've already appointed the assistant head

619
00:39:13,075 --> 00:39:15,211
Jiang Zhongmin as the head of the bureau.

620
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:21,750
Empress is resolute, as fast as the wind

621
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,294
I heard Empress say

622
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:26,111
that this morning, His Majesty saw

623
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:28,004
these withered flowers at Precious Smile's place?

624
00:39:29,223 --> 00:39:31,484
I heard the House of Respectful Affairs say

625
00:39:31,484 --> 00:39:34,728
that last night, he flipped Princess of Glory's plaque.

626
00:39:34,728 --> 00:39:37,334
Why would he be at Precious Smile's so early in the morning?

627
00:39:38,901 --> 00:39:42,296
The emperor has thoughts on his mind

628
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,012
That's right

629
00:39:44,012 --> 00:39:47,032
If Princess of Glory had kept him there,

630
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:48,811
and he hadn't gone to Precious Smile's,

631
00:39:48,811 --> 00:39:53,155
then Huang Guiquan wouldn't be so unlucky.

632
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:07,128
