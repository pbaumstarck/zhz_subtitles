1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,928
<i> ~ Episode 16 ~</i>

2
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:10,363
Jiang Zhongmin is keen and quick in his work

3
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:13,002
He has got it ready in such a short time

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,222
Young mistress, have you told his majesty last night

5
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:18,654
Does his mejesty still suspect that you were involved in

6
00:00:18,654 --> 00:00:20,465
young mistress Meizhuang's false pregnancy

7
00:00:22,328 --> 00:00:24,867
Whether his majety belive me or not only depend on his whim

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,825
I just need to do what I'm supposed to do

9
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,012
There's no need to bother him

10
00:00:30,932 --> 00:00:32,182
servant know

11
00:00:32,182 --> 00:00:33,569
Only when his majesty is happy

12
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:34,798
will he care about

13
00:00:34,798 --> 00:00:36,376
who make young mistress unhappy

14
00:00:36,376 --> 00:00:37,920
and punished Huang Guiquan

15
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,308
Then his majesty must have no suspecion to young mistress

16
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:41,515
Then his majesty must have no suspecion to young mistress

17
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:43,739
Probably

18
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:48,054
As long as he trusts young mistress

19
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:59,673
Your Majesty, Jiang Zhongmin from the Internal Affairs Authority is here

20
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:01,171
Tell him to come in

21
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:08,673
Reporting to Your Majesty

22
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,785
This slave requests for Your Majesty's instruction...

23
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:21,026
regarding how to divide these 3 pots of conch black dye.

24
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,451
You have to ask me on such a trivial matter?

25
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:26,478
The number of mouths exceed the amount of food.

26
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:28,268
To prevent dispute among the women,

27
00:01:28,268 --> 00:01:30,250
if would be best if Your Majesty decided how much to grant.

28
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:35,549
Although you're new, you're quite perceptive

29
00:01:37,594 --> 00:01:41,428
The Empress is the head of the inner palace. Her portion cannot be spared.

30
00:01:42,457 --> 00:01:45,339
Precious Wan is best at painting black-and-white sceneries.

31
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:47,585
Give some to her.

32
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:49,037
In addition...

33
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:53,891
I believe that brows are darker when not drawn.

34
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:57,025
Your Majesty need not consider me

35
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,748
Yes

36
00:02:15,328 --> 00:02:19,018
Actually, I should bestow you with one pot of conch black dye...

37
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:23,512
for telling me that Precious Shen's food was poisoned

38
00:02:23,512 --> 00:02:25,754
and preventing chaos in the inner palace.

39
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:30,966
Your Majesty has already said this before. <br>I've already forgotten all about it.

40
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:34,353
Why the need to thank me again?

41
00:02:50,716 --> 00:02:53,233
Here's this year's Snail Eyebrow Pencil

42
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,276
It used to be 3 boxes

43
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:01,589
in the past years

44
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:04,227
Why is there so little this year?

45
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,320
The Internal Affairs Authority says

46
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,184
this year, Persia produced a little snail eyebrow pencil

47
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,808
only 3 boxes in all

48
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:12,260
Then what about the other two?

49
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:15,075
One was given to the Empress

50
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,606
One was given to Precious Smile

51
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:21,968
That slut Zhen Huan again!

52
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,483
Last night she bewitched the Emperor

53
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:26,721
so that

54
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:28,514
even that lowly Princess of Regularity ridiculed me today!

55
00:03:29,391 --> 00:03:31,396
now she come to share my snail indigo

56
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:35,415
Never mind about the Empress

57
00:03:36,397 --> 00:03:38,142
I ought to give her some respects

58
00:03:38,913 --> 00:03:40,430
But what is Zhen Huan?

59
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:43,065
Niang Niang calm down, watch your health

60
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:45,826
Niang Niang, what's the use in getting upset?

61
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,483
Why not think long-term

62
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:49,077
Think long-term

63
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:52,233
I will definitely think of a plan for Niang Niang

64
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,478
to relieve your worries.

65
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:55,852
Zhen Huan is just a lowly Precious

66
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:58,748
but she can eliminate Huang Guiquan while protecting herself

67
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:00,719
how can you get a long-term plan

68
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,791
After all that effort you only managed to get rid of a Shen Meizhuang

69
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,237
Zhen Huan's standing is unshakeable

70
00:04:06,237 --> 00:04:07,687
Instead she's moving up by the day

71
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:11,101
I dare not believe you

72
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:13,198
Niangniang, you know black from white

73
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:16,224
Ever since I joined the inner palace, Niang Niang has treated me very well

74
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:18,160
I was not being half-hearted

75
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,261
Of course I know that

76
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:22,689
Otherwise would I tolerate your existence here?

77
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:29,831
I put so much effort into gaining His Majesty's favor

78
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:33,379
I will not be harmed by them!

79
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:42,577
Why didn't Sister bring the princess to play today?

80
00:04:43,837 --> 00:04:45,690
Princess only plays at His Majesty's?

81
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:49,005
Princess hasn't slept well

82
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,461
Other than going to His Majesty's in the afternoon,

83
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,567
she has stayed home the past two days.

84
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,671
Although you are her birth mother,

85
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,050
you are just a small Precious.

86
00:05:00,888 --> 00:05:02,197
Princess is sick

87
00:05:02,197 --> 00:05:04,446
It's inconvenient to keep her in your palace

88
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:05,732
Niang Niang

89
00:05:05,732 --> 00:05:07,832
Bring her here. I will help take care of her sickness.

90
00:05:08,603 --> 00:05:11,266
Niang Niang, Princess cries in the middle of the night

91
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:12,985
She will really disturb your rest

92
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,920
If Niang Niang likes,

93
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,447
I can bring her over anytime.

94
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:19,482
Quickly bring the princess over here

95
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:21,522
Leave the nurse here too

96
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:23,216
Yes

97
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:33,593
What? Afraid I'll harm the princess?

98
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,119
I dare not

99
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,479
I just feel

100
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,459
grateful that Niang Niang likes Princess so much.

101
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:44,055
That's good

102
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:49,359
Remember, if it weren't for me,

103
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:52,079
the princess would be raised in A Ge's department

104
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,888
without you to take care of her like this

105
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:55,989
Right

106
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,402
If princess were here

107
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,413
you would spare lots of time

108
00:06:00,397 --> 00:06:01,837
take time to think

109
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:04,636
how to solve my problem

110
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:06,320
I understand

111
00:06:17,104 --> 00:06:18,507
It's a little cool at night recently

112
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,709
I'm afraid Mei Jiejie's clothes is not enough

113
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:26,594
It is said put on clothes when it get cooler, though it is thin, warm because of your concern

114
00:06:27,323 --> 00:06:29,089
if Mei jiejie recived this clothes

115
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,032
she must feel warm in her heart

116
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:34,334
Adding your embroidery on it

117
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:35,989
by your dab hand

118
00:06:35,989 --> 00:06:37,795
makes it even better

119
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:43,145
Young mistress

120
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:44,914
Internal Affairs Authority just sent in a box of snail eyebrow pencil

121
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:46,486
His majesty gave to you

122
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:48,681
and ask you to draw the Distant Hill eyebrow

123
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:50,466
Keep it

124
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:52,061
Young mistress, have a try

125
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:54,074
the snail eyebrow pencils are very precious

126
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:59,393
I heared it is very expensive

127
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:00,649
if it were not the tribute

128
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:01,787
I couldn't even have a look

129
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:03,921
Jiejie, try it on

130
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:05,431
I can do this on my own

131
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:18,965
I've already handled the matter

132
00:07:18,965 --> 00:07:20,026
of asking Auntie Fang Ruo for help.

133
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,023
Young mistress Meizhuang

134
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:26,570
asked Auntie Fang Ruo to bring you this.

135
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:28,831
She insisted you get this

136
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:34,184
Take good care of yourself. Help Lingrong.

137
00:07:37,262 --> 00:07:38,739
Mei Jiejie is in such dire straits

138
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:40,828
but she still thinks completely of me.

139
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:44,489
Young mistress Meizhuang is right

140
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:47,287
Currently the only person you can rely on

141
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:49,668
is young mistress An.

142
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:13,613
Songzhi! The sun is so bright.

143
00:08:13,613 --> 00:08:15,258
Why aren't you carrying an umbrella for the princess?

144
00:08:15,432 --> 00:08:16,662
Isn't that an umbrella?

145
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:19,743
But the princess is still under the sun

146
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:22,465
Just a little bit. We will be there very soon.

147
00:08:22,465 --> 00:08:24,545
Songzhi, Princess is still young and weak

148
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,417
Servant knows Princess is young and weak

149
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:29,595
Princess is fortunate to receive Niang Niang's care

150
00:08:29,595 --> 00:08:32,388
Precious should be deeply grateful

151
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:34,374
Why are you instead so picky?

152
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:36,419
Miss Songzhi is too sensitive

153
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,382
To have Niang Niang dote on our princess,

154
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:40,084
Precious couldn't be happier.

155
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:44,018
It's natural for mothers to be concerned about their children

156
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:47,754
Enough, Niang Niang is still waiting for us

157
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:48,770
Hurry, let's go

158
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:56,185
Young mistress, we can't win against Princess of Glory

159
00:08:58,286 --> 00:09:00,714
I've always done everything she told me to

160
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:02,540
and planned schemes for her.

161
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,556
But she won't even let me keep my child!

162
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:10,340
These days of no freedom, relying on someone else for charity,

163
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:14,056
when will they be over?

164
00:09:14,284 --> 00:09:15,502
Young mistress don't be sad

165
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,888
Perhaps Princess of Glory will tire of it in a few days

166
00:09:18,888 --> 00:09:20,674
She will definitely return her to young mistress

167
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:22,481
Will she?

168
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:43,825
This child cries all day and night

169
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:44,835
How am I supposed to sleep?!

170
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:46,235
Niang Niang calm down

171
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:48,581
Get the nurse here

172
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:50,975
I would like to see how they quiet down the princess

173
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:51,969
Yes

174
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,073
Don't cry

175
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:06,794
What are you two doing to take care of Princess?

176
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:10,314
Princess cries all night

177
00:10:10,964 --> 00:10:12,126
I can't even sleep peacefully!

178
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,119
Servant has already tried everything possible to quiet her down

179
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:17,025
Perhaps Princess is not used to

180
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:19,345
leaving her birth mother and living in a different palace.

181
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:20,634
thus disturbing Niang Niang's sleep.

182
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:23,465
Have you really tried everything possible?

183
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:24,790
Servant is incapable

184
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,406
Give me the princess

185
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:29,640
Yes

186
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:44,459
Good Wen Yi, don't cry

187
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,994
This child is really difficult to quiet down

188
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:51,718
Songzhi

189
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:52,233
Yes

190
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:54,358
Bring the sedative drug that the imperial doctor prescribed me

191
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:55,862
then get a cup of water.

192
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:57,221
Yes

193
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:14,730
Quickly!

194
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:22,944
Niang Niang

195
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:29,745
Here, good Wen Yi, drink

196
00:11:30,244 --> 00:11:31,960
Niang Niang, Princess is still young

197
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,247
I'm afraid she can't take drugs like that

198
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:37,898
If I can take them, why can't she?

199
00:11:40,585 --> 00:11:42,262
If you dare utter a word to anyone,

200
00:11:42,262 --> 00:11:44,256
I will take your heads!

201
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:46,004
We know

202
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,436
Quickly take her

203
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:49,045
Quick

204
00:11:52,343 --> 00:11:53,043
Here

205
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:55,698
Don't cry

206
00:11:56,962 --> 00:11:59,987
If the princess makes any more noise, just use this method

207
00:12:01,082 --> 00:12:03,401
Yes, Niang Niang

208
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,518
Niang Niang doesn't know

209
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:15,037
Whenever the Emperor comes,

210
00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:17,763
Princess of Glory is very affectionate towards Princess.

211
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:21,109
But when he's not there, she does not care much for Princess

212
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:23,313
As wet nurses,

213
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:25,049
we must not have salt in our diets

214
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:26,341
in order to produce good breast milk.

215
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:29,090
But Princess of Glory doesn't care

216
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,389
so others care even less.

217
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:33,318
That's not all

218
00:12:33,563 --> 00:12:34,829
I can't produce good milk

219
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:36,386
Princess is unaccustomed to it

220
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:37,771
so she cries every night.

221
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:41,681
Princess of Glory actually fed her sedatives!

222
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:44,841
Princess taking these drugs at such a young age...

223
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:46,450
I'm afraid it will hurt her body!

224
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:53,334
But what can I do about it?

225
00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:58,638
Everytime I go, she won't let me see the princess for long

226
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:01,635
If I ask too many questions she gets angry

227
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:03,666
saying I don't trust her.

228
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:08,073
If you hadn't told me this,

229
00:13:08,985 --> 00:13:11,756
I would really be in the dark!

230
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:13,780
Precious, please think of ways

231
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,769
to bring princess back earlier.

232
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,404
Of course I want that!

233
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,270
But she is so pleased with herself right now,

234
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:25,214
how could she let go?

235
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:28,149
Servant will do everything to take care of princess

236
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:31,008
Precious, please relax for the time being

237
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:33,378
If princess can really come back,

238
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:35,691
servants will also be relieved

239
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:38,534
Alright

240
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:43,031
Lately your eye circles have darkened

241
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,801
Not sleep well?

242
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,719
No matter

243
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:51,508
I just went to see Wen Yi

244
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:53,690
She's a bit sleepy

245
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,855
Not as lively as before

246
00:13:56,326 --> 00:13:57,756
Is she not feeling well?

247
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,989
I'm guilty for not having taken good care of princess

248
00:14:04,904 --> 00:14:06,274
Wen Yi is young and not easy to take care of

249
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:09,078
Why don't you send her back to Precious Cao?

250
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:12,463
Precious Cao hasn't been feeling well lately

251
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:15,446
can't take care of princess, so she sent princess here

252
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:17,230
If I send her back now,

253
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,189
it will be difficult for Precious Cao to recuperate.

254
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:23,833
Your Majesty doesn't know

255
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,394
Princess cries every night

256
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:27,381
so she gets sleepy during the day.

257
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:29,534
Niang Niang can't sleep at night either

258
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:31,347
Even her eyes are red from lack of sleep

259
00:14:33,398 --> 00:14:35,969
It must be tough on you, get up

260
00:14:37,464 --> 00:14:38,328
Thanks Your Majesty

261
00:14:46,912 --> 00:14:49,853
Princess is still young. It's natural and normal for her to cry.

262
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:52,378
However, I think

263
00:14:52,378 --> 00:14:55,571
There are almost women in the heram, too much ying

264
00:14:56,357 --> 00:14:59,436
so princess cannot sleep well.

265
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:02,515
If there was some yang too keep balance

266
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:05,548
Today is 16th,

267
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:07,284
I will stay to keep you company

268
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:12,272
Tell Precious Smile to go to bed early

269
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:13,412
Yes

270
00:15:15,286 --> 00:15:18,120
Your majesty, try this tortoise and crane long life soup

271
00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:31,749
I haven't heard Wen Yi cry

272
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:35,614
Didn't I already say

273
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:38,803
Your majesty's imperial flavour can dominate the ying flavour

274
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:40,778
so princess won't cry

275
00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:44,796
What is that sound?

276
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:49,014
Your Majesty, it's thunder. Go to sleep.

277
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:04,718
Young mistress, what's wrong?

278
00:16:08,573 --> 00:16:10,184
Young mistress has always been afraid of thunder

279
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:11,630
especially the kind with lightning.

280
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,806
At home, madam always kept you company

281
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:17,738
In the palace, His Majesty also kept you company during most of the thunderstorms

282
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:20,516
Today, let me stay with you, alright?

283
00:16:23,531 --> 00:16:24,481
At this moment

284
00:16:25,842 --> 00:16:30,067
Right now, Princess of Glory must accompany his majesty

285
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:36,575
Too many things have happened lately

286
00:16:38,662 --> 00:16:39,957
I am really too tired

287
00:16:42,994 --> 00:16:44,029
Servant understands

288
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,396
Go outside to sleep

289
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:48,535
I would like to be alone

290
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:11,338
Huan Huan

291
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:13,924
It's me

292
00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:17,404
Dear 4th

293
00:17:18,982 --> 00:17:20,032
Dear 4th!

294
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:23,768
I was awoken by the thunder

295
00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:27,870
and remembered that you were afraid of thunderstorms with lightning.

296
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,956
There's thunder and lightning outside

297
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,727
Dear 4th really didn't need to come over

298
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,590
Exactly because of the thunderstorm

299
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:37,956
I didn't want you to be afraid

300
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:40,853
If you are elsewhere,

301
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:44,380
you won't be worried about me if you don't see me.

302
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:47,579
Even if eyes don't see, the heart sees

303
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:54,323
Then what about Princess of Glory?

304
00:17:59,684 --> 00:18:02,171
Will you always be this good to me?

305
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:04,362
Yes

306
00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:06,842
Even if you aren't,

307
00:18:07,704 --> 00:18:09,219
with your word,

308
00:18:09,898 --> 00:18:11,333
I feel much more at peace.

309
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:24,022
Niang Niang, His Majesty has already left for a while

310
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:27,969
Niang Niang, why don't you get some rest?

311
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:33,281
His Majesty has never done this before

312
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,634
He's never done this before!

313
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:41,149
Niang Niang

314
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:00,236
Niang Niang calm down!

315
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,414
Kill her!

316
00:19:19,873 --> 00:19:22,198
Niangniang, his majesty has left Hall of Cool and Refreshing

317
00:19:22,198 --> 00:19:24,016
and gone to Bitong Academy

318
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:28,166
Who knew Princess of Glory would have this day?

319
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,120
Even the old lover is good, but can't compare the new one

320
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,341
Today she experiences

321
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,195
the humiliation I felt back then.

322
00:19:36,997 --> 00:19:39,234
In the past, when His Majesty was with Niang Niang,

323
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:41,947
she used schemes to coax him away.

324
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,230
But today, His Majesty left on his own will

325
00:19:45,546 --> 00:19:47,969
If his heart's not there, what's the use in forcing him to stay?

326
00:19:49,383 --> 00:19:51,304
I remember last year, the governor of Guangdong and Guangxi

327
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:55,593
gave me a screen with mandarin ducks and double He as tribute

328
00:19:56,632 --> 00:19:58,283
Give it to Precious Smile

329
00:19:59,179 --> 00:19:59,896
Yes

330
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:02,369
What fragrance did you light?

331
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:05,722
Servant saw it was raining outside, very humid

332
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:08,863
Niang Niang was also reciting Buddhist scriptures, so I lit some sandalwood

333
00:20:10,954 --> 00:20:15,698
Loyaling to the Buddhism, not the sandalwood could represent

334
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,117
Even the most precious fragrances

335
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,726
are manufactured by man.

336
00:20:20,726 --> 00:20:22,539
They're still unclean

337
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:26,418
How could they compare to the natural fragrance of flowers and fruits?

338
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:28,643
Get rid of it

339
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:44,235
Young mistress, Lingrong is here

340
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:45,987
Jiejie

341
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:47,496
Meimei

342
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:51,444
I spent several days

343
00:20:51,444 --> 00:20:54,081
embroidering this silk brocade that Jiejie gave me.

344
00:20:54,081 --> 00:20:56,025
I came to give it to you

345
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:06,666
I think rather than embroider a crow

346
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,061
to look forwards his majesty's favour

347
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:11,112
I prefer

348
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:13,196
the spring peach blossom in the Royal Garden

349
00:21:13,196 --> 00:21:15,480
own the rain's favour

350
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,594
so the precious silk will not be wasted

351
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:24,156
(Poem) The peach trees are fulled of peach blossom

352
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:26,830
You will certainly make a harmonious and orderly home

353
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,226
Thanks for your compliment

354
00:21:30,773 --> 00:21:32,988
Your clothes and ornaments are a little worn

355
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:35,235
let me make you up

356
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:38,995
Come

357
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:45,152
Finished, do you like

358
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:50,748
Jiejie's clothes are colourful and luxury

359
00:21:51,618 --> 00:21:52,887
mine can't compare

360
00:21:53,466 --> 00:21:55,404
Colourful and luxury clothes are not suitable

361
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:57,779
in such hot weather

362
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:01,060
cool colour is more attracting than warm colour

363
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:05,554
Lotus coming out of crystal-clear water, beauty coming out of nature born

364
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,843
such natural beauty is the most moving thing

365
00:22:09,702 --> 00:22:10,625
Let's go

366
00:22:24,069 --> 00:22:25,394
Young mistress

367
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:29,480
Look at the mandarin ducks, good sign

368
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:33,869
Jiejie, I'm afraid I can't do it well

369
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:36,236
how about change a plan

370
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,135
If i introduce you to his majesty normally

371
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,985
it will be fine

372
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,051
but in this way

373
00:22:46,051 --> 00:22:47,734
even though you get the favour

374
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,809
his majesty won't put you in his heart

375
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:52,396
after several days, he will put you aside

376
00:22:52,983 --> 00:22:54,277
it's not good for you

377
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,566
Ghost Festival's fete is a big event in the palaces

378
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,616
you have to prepare it well

379
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,814
Yes

380
00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:04,635
I heard that princess Wenyi have always been sick and crying

381
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:09,274
I'll let the priest to pray for her

382
00:23:15,787 --> 00:23:17,148
Who is singing

383
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:19,027
Perhaps it's a singer from the palace

384
00:23:20,715 --> 00:23:23,586
Such a beautiful voice is indeed rare

385
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:30,875
Pick the flowers in time

386
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:39,085
don't wait until they fall

387
00:23:41,793 --> 00:23:42,662
Jiejie

388
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:45,866
Intoxicating

389
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:48,204
Jiejie really likes to joke with me

390
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,573
Who's singing?

391
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,011
Respects to Consort Hua.

392
00:23:57,011 --> 00:23:58,519
Respects to Consort Hua.

393
00:24:00,938 --> 00:24:01,905
Get up

394
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:03,118
Yes

395
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,935
When did Precious Wan learn to sing?

396
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,110
You can sing and dance...you really surprise me

397
00:24:13,414 --> 00:24:14,696
Niangniang praised the wrong person

398
00:24:14,696 --> 00:24:16,514
I don't have such voices

399
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:18,788
It was Promise An singing

400
00:24:24,514 --> 00:24:25,859
I was wondering who that was

401
00:24:26,585 --> 00:24:28,977
So it's the daughter

402
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:30,292
of An Bihuai who the Emperor forgave a few days ago.

403
00:24:31,546 --> 00:24:34,347
The guilty subject's daughter doesn't self-reflect on mistakes behind closed doors,

404
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:38,928
instead showing off everywhere. So indecent!

405
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,082
My father is not guilty

406
00:24:44,044 --> 00:24:46,886
Promise An's father was released and restored to his original post

407
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:48,425
He was not found guilty

408
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,300
Being released doesn't mean he was really innocent

409
00:24:51,954 --> 00:24:54,453
Precious Wan should know very well why

410
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,545
It's understandable for a lowly Promise to not know the rules

411
00:24:58,073 --> 00:25:00,303
But why didn't Precious Wan teach her the four social bonds of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor?

412
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:04,536
It's just a song. What does it have to do with the social bonds?

413
00:25:09,602 --> 00:25:11,353
Pick the flowers in time

414
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:15,314
the flowers are usually implicated women

415
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:18,939
By singing, isn't she trying to attract attention

416
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:20,993
and willing to be picked by anyone

417
00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:24,200
This song called Golden Clothes

418
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,793
mean to persuade people to cherish

419
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:27,962
not what you just said

420
00:25:29,175 --> 00:25:31,164
Precious Wan is so well-spoken

421
00:25:31,874 --> 00:25:34,667
but usually, a submissive woman is more likely to be a virtuous one

422
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,505
but not the one excuse herself with sophistry

423
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:39,304
Precious Smile doesn't even abide by the female virtues

424
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,396
argue against your superiors

425
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,602
I dare not

426
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:47,202
Precious Smile didn't mean to offend Niang Niang

427
00:25:47,202 --> 00:25:48,602
Niang Niang please forgive

428
00:25:49,285 --> 00:25:52,086
Isn't it too late to ask for forgiveness when you've already offended me?

429
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,400
As the head of the harem,

430
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,399
I will see to it

431
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:59,359
that you two abide by the rules!

432
00:26:02,247 --> 00:26:03,196
Come

433
00:26:03,544 --> 00:26:04,317
Yes

434
00:26:10,143 --> 00:26:12,759
Respects to your Majesty. Respects to Empress

435
00:26:13,816 --> 00:26:15,786
This voice is really beautiful

436
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:32,160
You rarely wear such bright colors

437
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:38,905
Get up

438
00:26:41,947 --> 00:26:44,155
What is it? Not very happy today?

439
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:47,023
On such a bright day

440
00:26:47,582 --> 00:26:49,545
how dare she sing the decadent song

441
00:26:56,343 --> 00:26:58,641
Tell me, what do you think of the song?

442
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:02,161
Promise An's voice sounds like nature

443
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:06,743
Empress praises me too much. I do not deserve it.

444
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:13,554
Only the chink of the Kunlun Mountain's jade and the weeping sound of the orchid

445
00:27:14,907 --> 00:27:16,380
could barely compare

446
00:27:21,591 --> 00:27:22,514
Lift your head

447
00:27:27,532 --> 00:27:30,235
What a "pick the flowers in time"

448
00:27:30,973 --> 00:27:32,195
What's your name?

449
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,826
An Lingrong

450
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:38,585
When you answer his majesty, you should add "concubine"

451
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:39,945
in this way, you would not be impoliteness

452
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:42,104
Many thanks for Niang Niang's advice

453
00:27:43,402 --> 00:27:45,212
Seems like you and Promise An

454
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:47,245
will have many more chances to meet.

455
00:27:48,062 --> 00:27:51,645
Meimei, take your time instructing her. There's plenty of time.

456
00:27:52,523 --> 00:27:53,449
Of course

457
00:27:54,557 --> 00:27:56,813
Empress has so many things to attend to in managing the inner palace

458
00:27:57,922 --> 00:28:00,778
Of course I should help share your burden

459
00:28:07,571 --> 00:28:08,480
Very good

460
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,102
The song is refreshing, the person is refreshing too

461
00:28:13,654 --> 00:28:17,375
Your Majesty, I'm a bit tired. I would like to go back first.

462
00:28:17,856 --> 00:28:18,810
Alright

463
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,694
Liuzhu, hurry. Take Precious Smile back to rest.

464
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:22,955
Yes

465
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:25,983
Then I will walk Jiejie back

466
00:28:46,728 --> 00:28:49,092
I really enjoyed Promise An's song

467
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:52,540
Let her sing it again for us

468
00:28:53,475 --> 00:28:54,702
Invite Promise An back

469
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:55,867
Yes

470
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,221
Jiejie, I'm going back now

471
00:29:12,862 --> 00:29:16,048
Get some good rest. Wait for His Majesty to call for you at night.

472
00:29:19,347 --> 00:29:22,244
Please wait Precious Smile, Promise An

473
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,169
What is it?

474
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:27,578
His Majesty invites Promise An

475
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,016
Hurry, go

476
00:29:46,996 --> 00:29:47,785
Hurry, go

477
00:30:05,142 --> 00:30:07,278
Replying to Your Majesty, Promise An is here

478
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:11,502
Your Majesty

479
00:30:16,204 --> 00:30:17,221
Walk with me

480
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:20,881
I have some things to discuss

481
00:30:20,881 --> 00:30:22,365
with Princess of Glory about the ghost festival.

482
00:30:22,365 --> 00:30:24,405
I can't stay

483
00:30:24,734 --> 00:30:25,659
Do as you see fit

484
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:36,423
Princess of Glory, let's go

485
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:44,836
Young mistress wants to go back right away?

486
00:30:47,557 --> 00:30:48,741
Let's walk along the lake

487
00:30:55,808 --> 00:30:58,639
Young mistress's outfit today looks great

488
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:00,446
Normally you don't like to wear red

489
00:31:00,446 --> 00:31:01,719
but red is so pretty!

490
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:04,082
It's also festive, like red clouds!

491
00:31:04,082 --> 00:31:07,033
The begonia flowers embroidered on it are also your favorite

492
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,619
The palace's embroidery is naturally the best

493
00:31:13,891 --> 00:31:16,724
Every stitch and thread, linked in countless ways

494
00:31:18,854 --> 00:31:20,637
How much work must have gone into this beauty

495
00:31:22,057 --> 00:31:23,750
Can't even miss a single stitch or thread

496
00:31:26,247 --> 00:31:29,511
Liuzhu, tell me, the needle point is so sharp

497
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,179
When it pierces the silk, does the silk hurt?

498
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,920
Why would young mistress think of that?

499
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,730
In embroidery,

500
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,647
The material is originally supposed to be poked by needles

501
00:31:42,647 --> 00:31:43,997
it's the destiny

502
00:31:43,997 --> 00:31:47,058
This material isn't a person, so it won't know pain

503
00:31:51,848 --> 00:31:54,653
Young mistress, look, the lotus flower is blooming abundantly

504
00:31:54,653 --> 00:31:55,889
How beautiful!

505
00:31:56,702 --> 00:31:57,535
Look!

506
00:32:00,282 --> 00:32:03,517
Yes, the lotus is blooming so well

507
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:07,635
It's long past the Begonia's season to bloom

508
00:32:13,923 --> 00:32:21,684
I urge you not to cherish the golden clothes

509
00:32:22,562 --> 00:32:29,914
I urge you to cherish your youth time

510
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:39,234
Pick the flowers in time

511
00:32:43,242 --> 00:32:44,571
Many thanks Your Majesty

512
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:56,856
Don't wait until they fall

513
00:33:01,214 --> 00:33:02,743
Respects to Duke Guo

514
00:33:02,743 --> 00:33:03,883
Quickly rise

515
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:04,883
Is His Majesty inside?

516
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,232
He invited me to play chess

517
00:33:07,351 --> 00:33:09,827
At the moment, I'm afraid he's unable to see you

518
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:13,382
I heard he has got a lady with beautiful voice

519
00:33:14,182 --> 00:33:15,448
better than the previous one

520
00:33:16,273 --> 00:33:17,412
It's Promise An

521
00:33:18,702 --> 00:33:19,958
Oh, I thought it was Precious Smile

522
00:33:20,511 --> 00:33:22,605
Usually Precious Smile serves His Majesty the most

523
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:25,232
But from now on, that may no longer be the case

524
00:33:26,969 --> 00:33:29,574
Then, seems like I came at the wrong time

525
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:31,508
Please take the trouble to inform him tomorrow

526
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:32,735
that I came.

527
00:33:32,735 --> 00:33:33,472
Yes

528
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:34,380
Goodbye

529
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,362
Go well Duke

530
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:38,364
It's time to call the night duty

531
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:00,693
Young mistress is back

532
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:04,039
Congratulations young mistress

533
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,275
Quickly get up

534
00:34:06,506 --> 00:34:08,129
Originally I wanted to wait outside the door for your return

535
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,996
but I didn't hear any sound.

536
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:15,066
I was supposed to return in a carriage

537
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,488
but I wanted to take a walk by myself.

538
00:34:18,163 --> 00:34:19,241
So I walked back

539
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:21,555
Young mistress, why exhaust yourself like this?

540
00:34:22,387 --> 00:34:27,325
Before, I would always walk around cautiously, with my head lowered

541
00:34:28,592 --> 00:34:30,962
Now I am officially a young mistress

542
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:34,627
I didn't know what it would feel like to walk around now

543
00:34:35,797 --> 00:34:37,989
so I wanted to take a walk.

544
00:34:38,697 --> 00:34:40,007
How does young mistress feel now?

545
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:45,551
Before I only stared at the road

546
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,419
and hadn't noticed the scenery in the palaces

547
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:56,171
agreed with me so much

548
00:35:02,522 --> 00:35:03,829
Promise An being favored

549
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:05,442
young mistress doesn't seem too happy about

550
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:08,876
I expected it, so I wasn't surprised

551
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,569
Young mistress, Promise An is here

552
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,288
Jiejie

553
00:35:18,344 --> 00:35:19,608
Here so early in the morning?

554
00:35:20,906 --> 00:35:22,280
I just paid my respects to the Empress

555
00:35:22,811 --> 00:35:25,110
I missed you so I came over

556
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,469
Young mistress An is different now

557
00:35:30,372 --> 00:35:31,605
You don't need to come over everyday

558
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:36,244
There is some tea outside

559
00:35:37,776 --> 00:35:39,336
Bring some in for young mistress An

560
00:35:46,138 --> 00:35:47,320
Do you blame me?

561
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:48,600
How could I?

562
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,044
I couldn't be happier for you

563
00:35:52,354 --> 00:35:53,685
I helped facilitate it

564
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,747
Why would I want to blame you?

565
00:35:56,331 --> 00:35:57,944
If Jiejie is the least bit unhappy,

566
00:35:57,944 --> 00:36:00,011
I will stop seeing the Emperor.

567
00:36:00,011 --> 00:36:01,288
You don't mean that

568
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,802
I am also half the matchmaker

569
00:36:05,851 --> 00:36:07,714
How could the bride refuse

570
00:36:07,714 --> 00:36:09,158
to see the groom on account of the matchmaker?

571
00:36:09,158 --> 00:36:10,369
Jiejie always teases me!

572
00:36:12,722 --> 00:36:13,866
As long as Jiejie doesn't blame me

573
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:20,236
Your clothes are a nice color

574
00:36:20,824 --> 00:36:21,899
matches your complexion

575
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:24,985
This is new tribute, sparkling silks, from Suzhou

576
00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:28,594
I heared walking in it, looks like the sparkling rivers

577
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,034
I only wore it because I liked the color

578
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:36,094
I remember there are only few pieces

579
00:36:36,763 --> 00:36:38,044
His Majesty gave them all to you?

580
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:40,239
Yes, originally

581
00:36:40,976 --> 00:36:43,881
but I dare not use such quality things.

582
00:36:44,392 --> 00:36:45,586
I only kept one

583
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:48,642
I gave two to Empress and Princess of Glory

584
00:36:49,393 --> 00:36:53,400
The remaining two, I brought them as gifts for you

585
00:36:54,636 --> 00:36:55,708
You're so considerate

586
00:36:56,671 --> 00:36:57,820
just what I should do

587
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,085
I heared in Tang dynasty, the sparkling silk clothes

588
00:37:02,085 --> 00:37:03,387
were tributes from Gaochang

589
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,154
It doesn't even get wet in rain

590
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:07,506
Now we can make it ourselves

591
00:37:08,046 --> 00:37:09,251
but I don't know

592
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:10,827
if it can also withstand rain.

593
00:37:11,898 --> 00:37:13,915
Then I will wear it next time it rains

594
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:23,325
So strange lately

595
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:25,512
Young mistress Lingrong hasn't visited us

596
00:37:25,512 --> 00:37:26,496
in two, three days?

597
00:37:27,229 --> 00:37:28,561
It's so hot and stuffy lately

598
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:30,010
Who would want to go outside?

599
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,838
Even the Empress has canceled the everyday's meeting

600
00:37:33,764 --> 00:37:34,682
That's true

601
00:37:35,718 --> 00:37:37,400
But it's all good as long as His Majesty comes

602
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:41,135
That's young mistress's business!

603
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:42,466
Why are you longing for him?

604
00:37:42,934 --> 00:37:44,457
Bad mouth! Who's longing for him?

605
00:37:44,457 --> 00:37:45,658
You!

606
00:37:45,658 --> 00:37:46,363
You're longing for him!

607
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:47,716
Be careful, young mistress will be unhappy if she hears!

608
00:37:47,716 --> 00:37:49,106
You're longing for him!

609
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:50,587
Don't say such nonsense

610
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:53,924
Auntie

611
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:57,826
Maidens, young mistress is just inside

612
00:37:58,248 --> 00:37:59,804
What if the Emperor comes later

613
00:37:59,804 --> 00:38:02,190
and sees all this clamor? How inappropriate

614
00:38:02,825 --> 00:38:04,852
Where is Auntie going with the food basket?

615
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,501
Young mistress wants me to visit young mistress An

616
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:09,894
She's afraid young mistress An will get heat stroke because her body is weak

617
00:38:09,894 --> 00:38:11,805
so she let me send these Shijin water

618
00:38:11,805 --> 00:38:13,357
and some medicine

619
00:38:14,724 --> 00:38:17,012
Young mistress cares about her more than she does about me and Liuzhu

620
00:38:18,326 --> 00:38:21,118
Don't be like this

621
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:22,548
Yes I know

622
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,287
She is now Lingering An

623
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:27,241
We're just a bunch of servants

624
00:38:33,597 --> 00:38:34,503
The past few days

625
00:38:34,503 --> 00:38:36,280
Huanbi's temper is getting bigger and bigger.

626
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,340
Even at home, young mistress would let her have her way

627
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,610
spoiling her like a younger sister.

628
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,548
Lately, she's been slacking off

629
00:38:42,548 --> 00:38:43,867
Who knows where she sneaks off to

630
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,432
Later, I will tell young mistress about her

631
00:38:46,432 --> 00:38:47,695
Auntie don't take it to heart

632
00:38:47,948 --> 00:38:48,862
No need

633
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:50,886
I just mentioned it casually. You can go.

634
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,379
I have something to ask you

635
00:38:54,379 --> 00:38:56,053
Has Lingrong somehow offended you?

636
00:38:56,053 --> 00:38:58,403
Why are you always

637
00:38:58,403 --> 00:38:59,435
giving her attitude?

638
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:01,597
Don't you think she's full of herself?

639
00:39:01,597 --> 00:39:03,770
flaunting her success in front of us?

640
00:39:04,465 --> 00:39:06,043
First the silk from Fuzhou

641
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,239
then the gemstone hairpin His Majesty just gave her

642
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,838
As if we haven't seen such things before!

643
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:11,041
Shut your mouth!

644
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:12,040
I only asked you one question

645
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,264
but you won't stop complaining about her!

646
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:15,723
She's the emperor's new pet

647
00:39:15,723 --> 00:39:17,651
Whatever gifts the emperor gives her,

648
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:19,155
is she supposed to hide them?

649
00:39:20,332 --> 00:39:21,723
Before, young mistress would get all the good things

650
00:39:21,723 --> 00:39:24,549
What does she have?

651
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:25,642
It doesn't matter what she has

652
00:39:25,642 --> 00:39:27,090
She is the emperor's wife!

653
00:39:28,102 --> 00:39:29,482
You need to remember your own status

654
00:39:29,482 --> 00:39:30,863
Don't cause trouble!

655
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:33,870
Yes

656
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,511
You are so moody

657
00:39:39,318 --> 00:39:41,347
Lingrong gave me two sparkling silk clothes

658
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:43,012
I saved one for you

659
00:39:43,824 --> 00:39:45,719
Remember, don't flaunt when you wear it

660
00:39:47,492 --> 00:39:48,242
Yes

661
00:39:51,175 --> 00:39:53,241
The crystal chestnut cake that the royal kitchen made today

662
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,168
I actually want some now

663
00:39:55,316 --> 00:39:56,588
I will get it for you right away
