00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,911
<i> ~ Episode 17 ~</i>

2
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:07,058
Huanbi Jiejie, your outfit is beautiful

3
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:08,768
Back at the imperial kitchen,

4
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:10,088
even those eunuchs were staring at you.

5
00:00:10,397 --> 00:00:12,846
My outfit is the same as young mistress Lingrong's

6
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:18,139
Young mistress loves Jiejie the most

7
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:20,609
She shares all her good things with Jiejie

8
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:26,034
Say, do I wear this outfit better

9
00:00:26,034 --> 00:00:27,693
or does Lingrong wear it better?

10
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:29,578
Before, about the same

11
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:32,120
But Jiejie's earrings are sublime

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,507
Are they gifts from young mistress?

13
00:00:33,757 --> 00:00:36,072
She's born from a poor family

14
00:00:36,072 --> 00:00:38,977
The best cloths would be a waste on her

15
00:00:39,526 --> 00:00:42,001
Let servant pick it for you. Young mistress watch your step.

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,970
Young mistress, look!

17
00:00:45,953 --> 00:00:47,275
What's the big deal?

18
00:00:48,127 --> 00:00:51,018
Young mistress, look. The outfit Huanbi is wearing...

19
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,282
Isn't that the one you gave to Precious smile?

20
00:00:56,584 --> 00:00:57,475
Indeed

21
00:00:58,404 --> 00:01:00,232
Precious Smile is quite generous

22
00:01:00,232 --> 00:01:01,740
Such great material...

23
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,675
Young mistress, you couldn't even bear to wear it yourself

24
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:05,269
leaving two for her.

25
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,328
But she...gives it to servants!

26
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,885
Don't say nonsense!

27
00:01:13,054 --> 00:01:14,554
Huanbi is Jiejie's close servant from back home

28
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:18,400
She normally does dress better than others

29
00:01:19,192 --> 00:01:20,690
It's fine if she doesn't want to wear it

30
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,943
but Huanbi is only a servant.

31
00:01:23,943 --> 00:01:27,026
Giving it to her...then what does she think of you?

32
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:44,219
It smells so fragrant

33
00:01:44,853 --> 00:01:45,978
What took you so long?

34
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:48,608
It was easy to get the chestnut cake

35
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,988
but I saw that the imperial kitchen had some yuca powder

36
00:01:50,988 --> 00:01:52,378
so I also brought some back.

37
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,760
I thought I'd make some pearl balls tonight

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,847
as a late-night snack for young mistress.

39
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,311
You're thoughtful

40
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:04,678
Since favoring Lingering An,

41
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:06,839
His Majesty has also relaxed a bit.

42
00:02:07,473 --> 00:02:08,980
Before, he would spend 6-7 hours at a time

43
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,510
reading documents

44
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,335
without taking a break.

45
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:14,859
Listening to songs relaxes him

46
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:16,000
He should

47
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:19,591
You are sensible, unlike that moody Princess of Glory

48
00:02:21,713 --> 00:02:22,764
Come

49
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:26,016
Don't be afraid. It's just a cat.

50
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:30,152
I heard Persia gave a cat as gift

51
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:32,361
which the emperor gave to 3rd prince.

52
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:33,638
This is the one

53
00:02:34,317 --> 00:02:35,598
3rd prince is filial

54
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:37,274
He knows that Princess of Regularity likes cats

55
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:38,753
so he gave it to her.

56
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,639
But when Princess of Regularity brought it over the other day,

57
00:02:43,082 --> 00:02:45,478
So she gave it to me

58
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,751
I gave it a name, Pine nut

59
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:50,776
Pretty name

60
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:52,894
You hold it?

61
00:02:54,947 --> 00:02:56,880
I forgot. You're afraid of cats.

62
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,751
Empress shows care for me

63
00:02:59,751 --> 00:03:01,730
You need not remember these little things

64
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:04,553
Come, sit

65
00:03:08,697 --> 00:03:10,575
Actually, although I really like it,

66
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:12,558
I must be careful.

67
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:14,856
It is an animal after all

68
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:17,806
If I'm not careful and get bitten or scratched,

69
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:18,789
that would not be good.

70
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:20,061
Empress worries too much

71
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:22,482
Pine nut was raised by you

72
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:23,936
It's very docile

73
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:25,247
Really?

74
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:28,246
Even people are unpredictable, much less animals

75
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,632
It's easy to let your guard down around those who are docile and close

76
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:40,746
Today's the 7th

77
00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:43,058
His Majesty invited all the dukes and inner palace

78
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:45,037
to enjoy the full moon at Chang Chun garden tonight.

79
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:46,623
Don't be late

80
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:48,521
Yes

81
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,376
Tonight's the 7th

82
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:54,938
I wish Your Majesties everlasting love,

83
00:03:54,938 --> 00:03:56,349
fortune, and longevity.

84
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:15,510
We sisters forgot

85
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,413
It's a shame

86
00:04:21,073 --> 00:04:23,450
I see that the grapes on your table are a tribute

87
00:04:23,954 --> 00:04:25,366
Give them to me

88
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:27,571
Yes

89
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:32,682
Your Majesty, you have some yourself

90
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:34,830
What do you want mine?

91
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:36,522
I see that you're busy talking,

92
00:04:36,522 --> 00:04:38,162
not eating,

93
00:04:38,162 --> 00:04:40,954
so you might as well give them to me and not waste them.

94
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:48,724
Your Majesty likes to joke with me

95
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:52,561
Lately, His Majesty

96
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:54,281
only likes to joke with Lingering An.

97
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:58,851
To others,

98
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:01,609
it sounds like you're trying to steal her thunder.

99
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,629
I have little talent and even less learning

100
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:11,082
Niang Niang please advise me in more matters

101
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:13,060
I would like to toast Princess of Glory

102
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:30,502
Princess of Glory is magnanimous

103
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:44,896
I'm a bit drunk. I want to take a walk outside.

104
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:48,860
This is my first time here. I'm not familiar with the garden.

105
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,435
How about Auntie Jin Xi go with young mistress?

106
00:05:55,627 --> 00:05:57,871
Your Majesty, I toast you

107
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,476
It feels so confined here

108
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:12,325
This Chang Chun garden

109
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:15,082
used to be the late emperor Kang Xi's favorite temporary residence.

110
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:18,465
After he passed away, it became more deserted.

111
00:06:20,812 --> 00:06:23,470
Look, just ahead is Tonghua Terrace

112
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,373
Young mistress wants to walk around outside

113
00:06:26,373 --> 00:06:29,596
It's too noisy near the banquet

114
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:31,302
Let's go look inside

115
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,425
Tonghua Terrace?

116
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:37,210
Such a unique, elegant name is rare in the palace

117
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:39,028
I heard that

118
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:42,259
that the Chinese parasol tree is the most loving, virtuous tree

119
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,975
so the late emperor dedicated this place to Princess Shu.

120
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:50,218
But it's a pity, that Princess Shu

121
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:54,494
During the late emperor's rule she was highly favored

122
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:59,666
But now she's a nun. It's really sad.

123
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,770
Why is it so deserted?

124
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:06,294
After His Majesty took the throne,

125
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:08,574
Empress Dowager thought Tonghua Terrace was too worn down.

126
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:11,587
People rarely come here

127
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:13,244
so it gradually became deserted.

128
00:07:15,223 --> 00:07:16,498
No matter how beautiful the love and things were

129
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:18,596
they just lasted for only a short time

130
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,694
Tonghua Terrace is such an example

131
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:24,172
so was the love between the late emperor and Princess of Su

132
00:07:25,105 --> 00:07:25,974
Yes

133
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:30,004
You stay here. I will go take a look.

134
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:35,051
Be careful!

135
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:45,780
Tonghua Terrace

136
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,551
Do you know what flower that is?

137
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:03,330
Who?!

138
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:05,883
Why does Precious Smile ask "who"

139
00:08:05,883 --> 00:08:07,488
everytime you see me?

140
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,956
Seems that my appearance

141
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,381
is indeed not very memorable.

142
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:14,747
Duke loves to sneak up behind people

143
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:16,893
Of course it's alarming

144
00:08:17,385 --> 00:08:19,086
It's Precious Smile who walked up before me

145
00:08:19,086 --> 00:08:20,869
and didn't see me.

146
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,620
It is not I who likes to hide behind you

147
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:26,823
Tonghua Terrace is full of plants. I failed to see you.

148
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:29,652
But why didn't Duke say something earlier?

149
00:08:32,142 --> 00:08:34,294
I thought you looked worried today

150
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:35,648
unlike in the past

151
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:37,959
so I dared not alarm you.

152
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:40,895
But I still ended up frightening Precious Smile

153
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:42,874
That was not my intention

154
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:47,017
I'm just a bit drunk. Thanks for Duke's concern.

155
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:49,373
There is a celebratory banquet in the palace

156
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:51,584
Why is Precious Smile out here?

157
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,153
Tonight is the July 7th (Chinese valentine's day)

158
00:08:54,153 --> 00:08:56,357
the moon light is more attracting

159
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:59,189
Exactly

160
00:09:00,913 --> 00:09:02,846
(Poem about July 7th) When autumn’s Golden Wind embraces Dew of Jade

161
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:05,565
All the love scenes on earth, however many, fade

162
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:09,598
If we just drink during such a beautiful night

163
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:11,297
What a waste

164
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:13,778
Just as you said

165
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:16,331
I was literary pursuits by a fluke for once

166
00:09:17,987 --> 00:09:21,151
Precious Smile seems to really like the flowers on the terrace

167
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:23,351
Indeed

168
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:25,921
When I was young, I often saw them outside in the fields

169
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:27,334
They're called morning glory

170
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:30,189
I rarely see this flower in the palace

171
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:31,976
so they are even more unique.

172
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:36,038
This flower has another name - sunset

173
00:09:37,057 --> 00:09:38,574
Indeed it shouldn't be in the palace

174
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:42,416
The palace does not plant flowers with such a short lifespan

175
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:44,780
Flowers also have short lifespans?

176
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,612
I thought only women did

177
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:52,742
They say this flower is lowly, just bloom in the corner

178
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:54,937
blooms at dusk, and falls in the next morning

179
00:09:54,937 --> 00:09:58,423
no one enjoy it, so the saying goes

180
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:00,023
So it is called short lifespan?

181
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:03,244
But I think this flower is extraordinary

182
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,176
sunset

183
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:08,392
it is the beautiful sunset scenery

184
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:12,194
Do you think so

185
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:15,240
I just don't want to regard such a pure and beautiful flower

186
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,316
as short lifespan

187
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:25,680
Where is Precious Smile

188
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:28,554
Your majesty

189
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:31,165
young mistress was drunk, so she went to the side hall to change clothes

190
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:34,924
Smile Jiejie is usually weak-headed

191
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:36,431
can't compare with your majesty's great capacity for liquor

192
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:41,757
The imperial family's night

193
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:44,875
Precious and I come here to avoid the noisy world

194
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:46,980
it is not proper

195
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:49,010
I'm nearsightedness

196
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:51,574
I can only see the sunset

197
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:55,373
I heared that Lingering An

198
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:57,254
is introduced to his majesty by you

199
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,846
are you feeling sorrow because of her?

200
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:04,828
We are sisters in the palaces

201
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:07,398
you are joking

202
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:09,786
Actually it's a good thing to have someone share the favor

203
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:13,072
If Precious Smile monopolizes all the favor

204
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,467
and becomes the object of hatred in the six palaces,

205
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,417
I would really cry for you.

206
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,586
Many thanks Duke

207
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:22,523
Precious is exceptionally intelligent

208
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:24,266
My words are superfluous

209
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:26,236
But as a bystander,

210
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:28,987
I find that you seem to have walked into a puzzle.

211
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:31,497
So I wanted to say something

212
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:34,933
It's very kind of you to advise me

213
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:37,404
Imperial brother is the ruler of the country

214
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:39,656
On some things, he has no choice

215
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:42,626
I hope Precious will understand him

216
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:46,063
I'm actually very glad

217
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:47,681
to not be the emperor.

218
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,291
I need not be bothered by all these worries

219
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:56,734
Duke's name is known everywhere

220
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:59,877
I'm afraid you're the prince charming many girls dream about

221
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:04,983
I dare not be greedy

222
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:07,553
I only wish for one soulmate to spend my life with

223
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:10,528
don't want many beautiful concubines.

224
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,060
Easy said

225
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:17,103
Precious doesn't believe me?

226
00:12:17,932 --> 00:12:19,057
I personally think that

227
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:20,769
to truly love someone

228
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:22,899
is to cherish each other

229
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:26,656
and not hurt each other in any way.

230
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:31,611
If Duke's words are true,

231
00:12:31,611 --> 00:12:34,252
then the future 17th Fu'jin is very fortunate.

232
00:12:36,219 --> 00:12:38,775
your suggestion is very commendable

233
00:12:39,314 --> 00:12:40,291
Precious need not thank me

234
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:43,724
I just don't wish imperial brother to favor Precious too much

235
00:12:45,293 --> 00:12:48,007
causing Precious to follow in my mother's footsteps.

236
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:51,445
only the candles and Buddha accompany her

237
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:57,728
It is rare for emperors to have true love

238
00:12:58,828 --> 00:12:59,728
if they do

239
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:01,577
they will hide it in the dark

240
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:03,244
and others also can't accept it

241
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:08,706
Just like sunset, only blooms for one night

242
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,577
I've been out here too long, I must leave now

243
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,370
When I abruptly showed up last time,

244
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,992
it was not my intention.

245
00:13:19,447 --> 00:13:20,841
The day of Princess Wenyi's birthday,

246
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,254
was also the day Mother entered the palace many years ago.

247
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,027
I was thinking of the past, and couldn't restrain myself in the moment

248
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:28,565
I lost my manners

249
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,725
I don't know what Duke is referring to

250
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:33,214
I don't even remember

251
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:41,818
Yes...I don't remember either...

252
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:43,257
Goodbye

253
00:14:09,187 --> 00:14:10,743
What took you so long outside?

254
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:16,313
I don't have much alcohol tolerance. I went outside to get some fresh air.

255
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:20,009
I saw a type of flower called "sunset"

256
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,168
I was mesmerized

257
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:24,853
Sunset? What kind of flower is that?

258
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:28,901
I saw that the crape myrtles in the courtyard were blossoming well

259
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,869
I will order someone to bring you several pots

260
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:37,091
Now is the season for crape myrtles to bloom

261
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:38,629
Many thanks Your Majesty

262
00:14:40,997 --> 00:14:43,232
Your Majesty is so good to Sister Smile

263
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:45,502
His Majesty treats everyone in the six palaces equally

264
00:14:45,502 --> 00:14:47,012
He's also very good to Jiejie

265
00:14:47,446 --> 00:14:48,534
Yes

266
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:51,192
Your majesty give each of us equal favor

267
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:54,038
Empress and all the concubines in the harem

268
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:55,467
are nourished by your favor

269
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,489
I'll drink a toast

270
00:15:17,473 --> 00:15:21,160
Your Majesty, I have something to take care of. I would like to pardon myself.

271
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,543
What's so urgent?

272
00:15:23,494 --> 00:15:26,397
Just now, the maid told me that Wenyi started throwing up her milk again

273
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:31,020
How could that happen?

274
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,145
Didn't she already get better?

275
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,156
Has the imperial doctor come to look at her?

276
00:15:36,717 --> 00:15:38,961
The imperial doctor came several days ago

277
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:41,010
The doctor said she was born to be weak

278
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,666
and the weather is hot, so she got sick

279
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:46,077
She had already gotten better

280
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:48,414
I odn't know why she's throwing up again

281
00:15:58,987 --> 00:16:00,678
Doesn't Jiejie find this odd?

282
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:03,127
How so?

283
00:16:04,803 --> 00:16:07,200
Babies often throw up

284
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,495
but Princess Wenyi keeps going back and forth.

285
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:11,338
If it's due to hot weather,

286
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:14,377
Princess Wenyi is staying in Princess of Glory's Hall of Cool and Refreshing.

287
00:16:14,377 --> 00:16:17,171
That place is the coolest

288
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,715
In the past, I never heard of Princess Wenyi

289
00:16:20,715 --> 00:16:21,999
throwing up milk.

290
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:23,806
It indeed happened suddenly

291
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:28,440
Perhaps she will get better after some good care

292
00:16:30,244 --> 00:16:32,130
Mothers always love their children

293
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:34,993
Let's hope that Precious Cao and Princess of Glory

294
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:36,594
can take good care of Wenyi.

295
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:39,951
Jiejie means...

296
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,181
For one's own glory and favor...

297
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:49,390
For a mother, isn't that too cruel?

298
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,313
I always thought people were kind by nature

299
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:56,376
but after all I've seen and heard in the palace,

300
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:57,943
nature can also be distorted.

301
00:16:57,943 --> 00:17:00,533
I cannot rule out such a malicious intent

302
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:03,894
I heard the servants say

303
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:05,562
that wives in the previous court

304
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:08,312
would often use their infant children to fight for favor.

305
00:17:11,982 --> 00:17:14,450
Mothers are naturally the warmest, gentlest people in the world

306
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,614
but in order to gain favor and glory in this palace,

307
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:19,326
they will not hesitate to use their children as weapons.

308
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:22,215
even their own children were used in such ways by themselves

309
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:24,839
no wonder many concubines hated other concubines' son

310
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,553
in order to get promoted

311
00:17:29,187 --> 00:17:30,829
Jiejie need not lament about others

312
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:32,425
Jiejie has been favored for a long time

313
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:34,574
and should have had your own child by now.

314
00:17:34,882 --> 00:17:35,888
Me?

315
00:17:36,737 --> 00:17:38,351
I wish I had one when I don't

316
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:41,617
but if I have one, there will be many troubles

317
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:45,733
so let the fate decide

318
00:17:51,043 --> 00:17:53,224
Lately I often hear a woman singing

319
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:55,221
with a voice like an oriole.

320
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:57,733
That should be Lingering An

321
00:17:59,907 --> 00:18:01,377
Hearing her voice

322
00:18:02,022 --> 00:18:06,394
makes me think of when Empress Chun Yuan was still here.

323
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:11,375
Niang Niang

324
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,118
Niang Niang, it's windy at night

325
00:18:16,118 --> 00:18:18,872
Let's go inside

326
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,403
A barren woman...

327
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:27,241
who still cares about her health?

328
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:31,720
Niang Niang, don't be sad

329
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:35,181
I'm no longer sad

330
00:18:37,722 --> 00:18:40,625
In my heart, I only feel hate

331
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:43,735
Niang Niang

332
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:49,264
I've never forgotten

333
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,681
how Princess of Glory force-fed me safflower poison back then.

334
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:57,094
After so many years,

335
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:00,355
the taste of that drug

336
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:04,424
is still in my mouth.

337
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,898
Niang Niang!

338
00:19:15,993 --> 00:19:18,156
We will have an opportunity

339
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:27,632
Not only do we need an opportunity, we also need the right person

340
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:31,146
Niang Niang means...

341
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:34,927
The first time I saw her face,

342
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:36,822
I just knew

343
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:42,244
that she would definitely help me someday.

344
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:50,099
Don't cry, don't cry

345
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:52,848
Look

346
00:19:52,848 --> 00:19:55,049
Your Majesty, the rattle drum you wanted

347
00:20:06,951 --> 00:20:08,340
Princess still doesn't seem to be better

348
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:12,855
The imperial doctor is useless

349
00:20:14,142 --> 00:20:15,161
I am useless

350
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:18,840
Your Majesty, you can't rush childrens' sickness

351
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:22,444
I saw that princess likes the water chestnut soup

352
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:26,948
how about preparing some more

353
00:20:26,948 --> 00:20:29,406
and everyone can also have a try

354
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:31,606
Fine, I'm hungry, too.

355
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:35,906
I'll oder them to prepare

356
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:47,452
I saw that princess like it,

357
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:48,873
she's getting well

358
00:20:49,436 --> 00:20:51,040
Thanks Empress' concern

359
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,326
also becouse of Princess of Glory's effort

360
00:20:54,326 --> 00:20:56,365
she's working hard to look after the princess

361
00:21:00,404 --> 00:21:01,969
Young mistress, princess hasn't got well

362
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,156
she spit out the milk againg

363
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:05,655
even the water chestnut soup has all been spit out

364
00:21:06,203 --> 00:21:07,332
What's the matter

365
00:21:08,124 --> 00:21:09,646
You have been treating her for two days without any effect

366
00:21:09,646 --> 00:21:11,205
instead, she's getting worse

367
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:15,893
I...I really don't know

368
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:17,857
According to my common sense

369
00:21:17,857 --> 00:21:19,710
infants usually regurgitate milk

370
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,088
when one or two months old

371
00:21:21,088 --> 00:21:23,030
cause by the slender pylorus

372
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,184
but princess is already 1 year old now

373
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,886
useless

374
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:31,454
your majesty, don't be angry

375
00:21:31,454 --> 00:21:34,603
you'd better let the imperial doctor check her carefully

376
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:37,693
In my opinion

377
00:21:37,693 --> 00:21:39,436
princess suffers from indiestion

378
00:21:39,436 --> 00:21:40,984
she probably eat something bad for her stomach

379
00:21:40,984 --> 00:21:42,486
I want to check the food

380
00:21:42,486 --> 00:21:43,931
that princess has had these days

381
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,864
Your majesty, I think the water chestnut soup has problem

382
00:22:30,961 --> 00:22:32,040
To be careful

383
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,257
please let the food-taste Gonggong distinguish as well

384
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:39,895
Xiao Xiazi

385
00:22:40,622 --> 00:22:41,482
Here

386
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:17,254
Your majesty, the water chestnut soup is non-poisonous

387
00:23:17,574 --> 00:23:19,700
but there is some cassava powder in it

388
00:23:20,126 --> 00:23:22,365
Cassava powder? What's that

389
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:24,486
Cassava is a kind of tribute from southeast Asia

390
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,875
its powder can be a material to make dessert

391
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,854
but its roots and leaves are poisonous, should be cleaned carefully

392
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:30,439
In your point view, it was poisoned by someone

393
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,192
Cassava is non-poisonous itself

394
00:23:32,192 --> 00:23:33,830
but the infant's stomach is weak

395
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,552
it will irritate the infant's stomach and cause vomit

396
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:38,658
if continue to have it for a long time, the infant will die

397
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:41,185
Besides, the cassava powder and water chestnut powder are similar

398
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:42,856
in their colour and appearance

399
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,822
if they are mixed, it will be difficult to distinguish

400
00:23:46,285 --> 00:23:49,411
Your majesty, princess had it every day

401
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:53,276
it must be the reason

402
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:56,767
How is the imperial kitchen doing its job?!

403
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:58,443
To even mix this up?!

404
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:01,649
The imperial kitchen is skillful at food, it can't be them

405
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:07,613
I think someone must have done it on purpose

406
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,638
How sinister

407
00:24:13,223 --> 00:24:16,228
Trying to kill my daughter?

408
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,608
Your Majesty, Heavens please take pity on Wenyi

409
00:24:21,608 --> 00:24:25,668
As her mother, I'm willing to accept any punishment

410
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:26,969
Quickly get up

411
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:29,435
What's the use in begging the heavens?

412
00:24:30,914 --> 00:24:32,183
There is definitely someone behind this

413
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:34,454
deliberately giving you mother and daughter a hard time.

414
00:24:36,897 --> 00:24:39,117
Your Majesty, please take pity on Precious Cao and her daughter

415
00:24:39,117 --> 00:24:40,772
by thoroughly investigating this matter.

416
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:42,483
It will also eliminate such behavior in the palace

417
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:48,925
Then let's investigate it

418
00:24:49,973 --> 00:24:51,290
Get the head of the imperial kitchen

419
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,957
to bring everyone who has been in touch with the cassava powder recently.

420
00:24:54,665 --> 00:24:56,547
Then check which palaces have taken the powder

421
00:24:56,547 --> 00:24:59,267
Don't miss a single one!

422
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:06,110
Niang Niang, drink your medicine

423
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:20,348
Why did it take so long to bring the medicine today?

424
00:25:20,348 --> 00:25:21,999
I heard the imperial doctors say

425
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:23,469
that Princess Wenyi is always throwing up

426
00:25:23,469 --> 00:25:25,973
so I asked some questions.

427
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,651
Do you think it's odd?

428
00:25:29,065 --> 00:25:30,095
I don't know

429
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:35,634
I'd like to take a walk today

430
00:25:36,304 --> 00:25:37,663
and visit the princess along the way.

431
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:41,408
Niang Niang has been secluded for many years, why go out now?

432
00:25:42,722 --> 00:25:43,643
Secluded?

433
00:25:45,034 --> 00:25:49,605
It's just a pity that while the tree prefers calm, the wind blows constantly

434
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:53,317
Servant checked

435
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:55,293
Only Precious Smile's palace

436
00:25:55,293 --> 00:25:57,969
had someone pick up cassava powder four days ago,

437
00:25:57,969 --> 00:25:59,978
saying they wanted to make pearl balls.

438
00:25:59,978 --> 00:26:01,715
Aside from her, no one else

439
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:14,005
Four days ago, I wanted to eat water chestnut cake

440
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,259
so I asked Huanbi to pick some up.

441
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:18,594
When she returned, she did indeed bring some cassava powder

442
00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:20,452
to make pearl balls for me.

443
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:25,662
Then, dare I ask Precious Smile...is the cassava powder still there?

444
00:26:26,979 --> 00:26:28,074
I'm sure it hasn't been used up yet

445
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,192
Only people from Precious Smile's palace have picked it up?

446
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,464
No one else?

447
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:35,458
Yes

448
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:38,434
That doesn't prove Precious Smile did it

449
00:26:46,219 --> 00:26:47,291
Replying to Your Majesty,

450
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,709
during the July 7th banquet Precious Smile went out by herself.

451
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:52,227
Servant seems to have seen Precious Smile walking towards Princess of Glory's

452
00:26:52,227 --> 00:26:54,002
Hall of Cool and Refreshing.

453
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:56,876
Did you see it with your own eyes?

454
00:26:57,445 --> 00:26:58,991
With my own eyes, absolutely

455
00:26:59,732 --> 00:27:00,825
Servant saw it too

456
00:27:00,825 --> 00:27:03,978
At the time, young mistress was also with Auntie Jin Xi

457
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:10,913
At the family feast

458
00:27:10,913 --> 00:27:13,579
most of the servants in the Hall of Cool and Refreshing were serving by the side

459
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:17,216
the others were snatching a moment of leisure

460
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:20,215
very likely, someone has caught the chance

461
00:27:20,215 --> 00:27:22,009
to poison the food

462
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:24,984
It seems that

463
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:30,076
Precious Smile, you're so cruelhearted

464
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:33,541
Maybe my inappropriate words and deeds

465
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:35,091
have offended Precious Smile unintentionally

466
00:27:35,091 --> 00:27:37,314
but that day in the Hall of Policy

467
00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:38,850
I was definitely unintentionally

468
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,260
didn't meant to cause misunderstand

469
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,608
between your majesty and you

470
00:27:43,384 --> 00:27:45,709
But if you held the grudge because of this

471
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:48,994
you can just beat and scold me

472
00:27:48,994 --> 00:27:51,246
don't harm my Wenyi

473
00:27:51,246 --> 00:27:54,194
She's just a infant in the swaddling

474
00:27:58,459 --> 00:27:59,552
Cao Jiejie misunderstood me

475
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:02,672
I never thought you offended me

476
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:04,870
As to the case in the Hall of Policy

477
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,748
there's no misunderstanding between his majesty and me

478
00:28:07,748 --> 00:28:09,787
no need to mention grudges

479
00:28:11,282 --> 00:28:12,547
Could it be that you think

480
00:28:12,547 --> 00:28:14,546
you have done something bad for me

481
00:28:14,546 --> 00:28:16,242
but I didn't even realize

482
00:28:19,178 --> 00:28:21,596
Precious Cao, the case is still unclear

483
00:28:21,596 --> 00:28:23,265
your weeping and wailing behavior

484
00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:24,831
is undignified

485
00:28:25,187 --> 00:28:25,925
Yes

486
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:27,851
I saw it clearly

487
00:28:28,294 --> 00:28:29,542
by saying this

488
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,693
Empress is partial to Precious Smile

489
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:35,247
Princess of Glory, according to the ritual

490
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:37,788
you can't say such words to me

491
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,364
I was unintentional to offend you

492
00:28:41,272 --> 00:28:43,282
but the princess has suffered so much

493
00:28:43,282 --> 00:28:45,799
I think it is unfare to Precious Cao

494
00:28:47,465 --> 00:28:49,200
Your majesty, please help her

495
00:28:49,803 --> 00:28:54,048
even though you're concerning about Wenyi, you should respect Empress as well

496
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:57,124
after all, she is the master of the harem

497
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,204
Precious Smile, say what you want to say

498
00:29:08,434 --> 00:29:10,327
I have never done such thing

499
00:29:10,327 --> 00:29:12,213
and I won't

500
00:29:12,897 --> 00:29:15,336
Have you been to the Hall of cool and refreshing that night

501
00:29:17,252 --> 00:29:18,912
I have passed by the Hall of Cool and Refreshing

502
00:29:19,461 --> 00:29:20,691
but I never walk in

503
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:25,679
Jinxi was with me, she can be my witness

504
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:29,889
Jinxi is your maid, her word can't be counted

505
00:29:31,221 --> 00:29:32,682
Except for the imperial kitchen,

506
00:29:32,682 --> 00:29:34,408
only your palace have cassava powder

507
00:29:35,188 --> 00:29:37,825
besides, these maids have seen you

508
00:29:37,825 --> 00:29:39,605
walk towards the hall of cool and refreshing

509
00:29:40,464 --> 00:29:42,172
after that, princess got sick

510
00:29:42,172 --> 00:29:45,550
I'm afraid it's not the word -- coincidence,

511
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,120
can explain

512
00:29:48,238 --> 00:29:49,745
Though everything is pointing at me

513
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:52,076
I've never done this

514
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,877
Your Majesty, Empress, please clearly investigate

515
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:56,942
Since you say you didn't do it,

516
00:29:56,942 --> 00:30:00,031
then after leaving the banquet that night

517
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,667
did you meet anyone?

518
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:05,879
who can prove you didn't enter the Hall of Cool and Refreshing?

519
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,298
Which also proves you have nothing to do with this

520
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:17,810
I...did not meet anyone

521
00:30:19,305 --> 00:30:20,856
But I don't know if anyone else

522
00:30:21,634 --> 00:30:23,675
saw me not enter the Hall of Cool and Refreshing.

523
00:30:25,454 --> 00:30:26,716
Think carefully

524
00:30:27,931 --> 00:30:30,402
If you think of anyone

525
00:30:30,402 --> 00:30:33,277
who can prove you didn't enter the Hall of Cool of Refreshing,

526
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:34,983
tell me.

527
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:43,957
Then I will just have to ground you for the time being

528
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:50,139
Trust me, I will definitely get to the bottom of this

529
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,688
I will not falsely accuse anyone

530
00:30:52,688 --> 00:30:54,877
Even you said so

531
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:57,364
Yes, I trust you

532
00:30:58,168 --> 00:31:00,178
Then you will have to bear it for a while

533
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,170
Your Majesty

534
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:14,618
That night, Precious Smile was with me

535
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:31,261
Respects to Your Majesty and Empress

536
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,252
Didn't I say you can forgo the manners?

537
00:31:33,252 --> 00:31:34,802
Sit down first

538
00:31:34,802 --> 00:31:36,238
Thanks Your Majesty, Empress

539
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,417
Your body can't take the hot weather

540
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:49,505
Why did you come out here?

541
00:31:49,505 --> 00:31:52,323
I heard the princess was not well, so I wanted to come visit

542
00:31:52,858 --> 00:31:54,717
I saw something big happening inside

543
00:31:54,717 --> 00:31:57,079
so I dared not come in right away.

544
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:03,215
But it's a good thing I came

545
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:07,810
Otherwise someone would be unjustly accused

546
00:32:10,101 --> 00:32:13,862
Princess of Modesty, you say you were with Precious Smile that night

547
00:32:13,862 --> 00:32:15,614
Is that true?

548
00:32:17,582 --> 00:32:20,661
That night, I thought Precious Smile seemed a bit drunk

549
00:32:20,661 --> 00:32:24,846
and was worried so I went to check on her with Jixiang.

550
00:32:25,774 --> 00:32:29,834
Afterwards, we both went back to my palace

551
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:31,906
and chatted for a long time.

552
00:32:32,526 --> 00:32:33,492
Jixiang

553
00:32:33,861 --> 00:32:34,481
Yes

554
00:32:36,597 --> 00:32:39,577
That night, Niang Niang and Precious Smile discussed Buddhist scriptures

555
00:32:39,577 --> 00:32:40,716
They really hit it off

556
00:32:40,716 --> 00:32:42,884
Then Precious Smile said it was getting late

557
00:32:42,884 --> 00:32:44,110
and hurried back.

558
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,806
That means

559
00:32:46,806 --> 00:32:48,320
Princess Wenyi's incident

560
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,199
has nothing to do with Precious Smile?

561
00:32:51,906 --> 00:32:54,746
Princess of Modesty came just in the nick of time, like a much needed rain

562
00:32:55,622 --> 00:32:58,246
Princess of Modesty has always stayed in her palace nursing her health, never leaving home

563
00:32:58,246 --> 00:33:02,265
That night, why did you ignore the imperial doctors' advice

564
00:33:02,265 --> 00:33:03,989
and go out at night?

565
00:33:05,705 --> 00:33:08,141
Indeed, bedridden people should not go out

566
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:10,722
But on the day of the banquet,

567
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:14,456
I heard excellent music

568
00:33:14,456 --> 00:33:17,257
and went outside as if in a rapture.

569
00:33:18,402 --> 00:33:21,639
I wasn't expecting the good luck of meeting Precious Smile

570
00:33:22,189 --> 00:33:24,676
Yes, I feel the same way

571
00:33:26,135 --> 00:33:28,817
Oh? Then why didn't Precious Smile

572
00:33:28,817 --> 00:33:32,398
mention meeting Princess of Modesty earlier?

573
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,742
I shouldn't have hidden this

574
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:43,995
When Princess of Modesty went out that day,

575
00:33:43,995 --> 00:33:45,804
she didn't want anyone to know

576
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:47,803
to avoid worrying the Emperor and Empress.

577
00:33:47,803 --> 00:33:50,728
So about our meeting that day

578
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:53,216
I didn't want to tell anyone.

579
00:33:53,216 --> 00:33:56,252
Who knew this would involve the princess?

580
00:33:56,252 --> 00:34:00,889
I know that the Emperor is wise, the Empress intelligent,

581
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:02,887
and will definitely uphold my innocence.

582
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:05,711
I didn't want to lose Princess of Modesty's trust,

583
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,888
so I kept my lips sealed.

584
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:12,023
What, Princess of Glory doesn't believe it?

585
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,960
I am not being mistrustful

586
00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:16,211
I just think that

587
00:34:16,211 --> 00:34:19,928
Princess of Modesty seems very partial to Precious Smile.

588
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:25,298
I've only met Precious Smile twice

589
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:29,556
The first time was also at Wenyi's birthday banquet

590
00:34:37,795 --> 00:34:39,217
Why would I lie

591
00:34:39,217 --> 00:34:41,289
to protect someone I don't know very well?

592
00:34:51,346 --> 00:34:52,302
Get up

593
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:57,604
Sit

594
00:34:57,604 --> 00:34:59,327
Have the imperial doctor take a good look later

595
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:01,620
Summer clothes are thin

596
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,361
Don't hurt yourself from kneeling

597
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:06,766
Precious Smile keeps her promises

598
00:35:15,935 --> 00:35:19,232
It's reasonable for Princess of Glory to not believe me

599
00:35:19,973 --> 00:35:21,674
When I was just outside the room,

600
00:35:21,674 --> 00:35:23,567
I thought I heard the servant ladies say

601
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:25,512
that they saw Precious Smile

602
00:35:25,512 --> 00:35:27,244
walking in the direction of Cool and Refreshing Hall that night.

603
00:35:27,883 --> 00:35:30,282
Might as well make things clear now

604
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:34,397
to end the dispute once and for all.

605
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,263
Say again

606
00:35:39,174 --> 00:35:40,966
Did you see, with your own yes, Precious Smile enter

607
00:35:40,966 --> 00:35:42,519
the Cool and Refreshing Hall?

608
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:44,797
Servant did see Precious Smile

609
00:35:44,797 --> 00:35:46,143
walk in the direction of Cool and Refreshing Hall.

610
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:49,745
As for whether she went inside, it seemed...

611
00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:52,532
What seemed?! That's totally groundless!

612
00:35:53,844 --> 00:35:54,494
What about you?

613
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:55,651
Servant...

614
00:35:55,651 --> 00:35:58,081
Servant only saw Precious Smile walking with Auntie Jinxi

615
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:02,107
Your Majesty, what do you think?

616
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:03,139
Do as you see fit!

617
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:04,799
Just one thing

618
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:07,170
Don't go easy on this bad habit of chasing wind and clutching at shadows (making groundless accusations)!

619
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,790
Yes

620
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,225
Drag them out and give 80 face slaps each! As a warning to others!

621
00:36:20,355 --> 00:36:22,125
Precious Smile, please wait

622
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:44,783
Is Precious Smile willing to walk with me?

623
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:50,214
I was just thinking the same

624
00:36:53,872 --> 00:36:56,978
Many thanks Niang Niang for helping me today

625
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,976
I have my reasons for helping you

626
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,152
Niang Niang really believes I'm innocent?

627
00:37:08,571 --> 00:37:09,588
That day,

628
00:37:09,588 --> 00:37:12,542
I saw you walk out of Chang Chun Garden with a servant

629
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:14,341
and pass by my palace.

630
00:37:15,154 --> 00:37:18,058
By calculating the time, I knew it wasn't you

631
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:21,274
I was in a hurry that day and didn't see Niang Niang

632
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:22,926
I hope Niang Niang will forgive me

633
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:26,446
These are all little things

634
00:37:27,336 --> 00:37:28,904
Princess Wenyi is very cute

635
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:32,728
but she's suffering so much torment at such a young age.

636
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,524
Although Princess's body is weak,

637
00:37:35,524 --> 00:37:39,207
she is the emperor's daughter and protected by the gods.

638
00:37:43,203 --> 00:37:44,786
Precious Cao's child

639
00:37:44,786 --> 00:37:47,277
originally couldn't be born.

640
00:37:47,277 --> 00:37:49,554
She became pregnant at the wrong time

641
00:37:49,554 --> 00:37:53,509
It was also a difficult birth. The fetal position was not right.

642
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,832
It nearly cost her life

643
00:37:57,922 --> 00:38:01,411
But the emperor especially loves and dotes on this child

644
00:38:02,922 --> 00:38:06,189
Children in this palace seem great

645
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:08,377
but they suffer way more ailments and disasters

646
00:38:08,377 --> 00:38:11,743
than children outside.

647
00:38:15,787 --> 00:38:18,248
Precious Smile, you were the target in all this

648
00:38:19,169 --> 00:38:21,322
You must take good care of yourself

649
00:38:22,373 --> 00:38:24,576
I can protect you once today

650
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:27,256
but not all the time.

651
00:38:29,093 --> 00:38:30,424
Thanks Niang Niang for being thoroughly considerate

652
00:38:31,488 --> 00:38:35,324
I will visit Niang Niang when I have time

653
00:38:35,928 --> 00:38:36,922
No need

654
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,661
Besides, it would be more beneficial

655
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,855
if we don't see each other that much.

656
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:55,045
Yes

657
00:38:58,287 --> 00:38:59,507
Precious Smile,

658
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:02,072
Niang Niang's body is weak and should go back early to rest.

659
00:39:02,348 --> 00:39:04,522
Then I won't disturb you anymore

660
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:19,155
Niang Niang

661
00:39:22,623 --> 00:39:24,158
How should this matter be handled?

662
00:39:25,182 --> 00:39:27,597
Yes, I've already thought about it

663
00:39:27,597 --> 00:39:30,003
How about letting some one be the scapegoat

664
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:31,149
and end this

665
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,781
Do you guarantee no problems?

666
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:35,319
Yes, I'm willing to guarantee

667
00:39:37,305 --> 00:39:40,719
That's good. As long as I'm not exposed.

668
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:44,663
Crying all day and night, so annoying

669
00:39:44,663 --> 00:39:46,442
Take her away!

670
00:39:47,582 --> 00:39:48,495
Yes!

671
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,846
Then bring her back later

672
00:39:52,608 --> 00:39:53,817
I understand

673
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:07,722
