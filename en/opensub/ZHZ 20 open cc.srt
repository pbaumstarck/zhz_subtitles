00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,826
<i> ~ Episode 20 ~</i>

2
00:00:07,567 --> 00:00:09,664
Respects to Precious Smile

3
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:14,867
What is the important thing that you must bring it so carefully

4
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:17,399
His majesty specially give this to young mistress

5
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:19,093
I'll show you

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,762
Young mistress, have a look

7
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:24,300
the shoe sole is made of jade

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,997
it is a kind of famous jade from Lantian, touches warm

9
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:29,317
so it won't be cold when you wear it

10
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:31,102
And the shoes are hollowed inside

11
00:00:31,102 --> 00:00:32,814
and filled up with many kinds of spices

12
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:35,545
his majesty said, that's called Every Step Gives Out Fragrant

13
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:38,518
On the toe cap is a Hepu pearl

14
00:00:38,518 --> 00:00:40,813
it can't compare with our eastern pearl when it comes to the meaning of honourable

15
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:43,537
but it is mellow, huge and bright

16
00:00:43,537 --> 00:00:45,204
The most precious part is the shoe upper

17
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:47,566
it is made of goldthread-embroidered Shu silk

18
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:49,780
Not mention the others

19
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:52,527
but the Shu silk is very hard to come by

20
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:55,397
especially the goldthread-embroidered Shu silk

21
00:00:55,397 --> 00:01:00,048
I heard 10 women will cost 3 months to embroider a roll of Su silk

22
00:01:00,048 --> 00:01:02,512
a inch is equal to 10 dous( unit of measure)

23
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:05,654
It is hard to even have a look

24
00:01:05,654 --> 00:01:07,985
no need to mention it is made to shoe upper

25
00:01:09,788 --> 00:01:11,285
Many thanks to his Majesty

26
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:14,081
but where is the Shu silk from

27
00:01:14,483 --> 00:01:17,356
I remember the tributary silk from Shu has just arrived in Feb.

28
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:19,493
only sent to Empress and Empress Dowager

29
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:22,168
the new silk should arrive in next Feb.

30
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:24,323
So this is his majesty's special favour to you

31
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:26,245
The Department of Shu Silk got new type of design and colour

32
00:01:26,245 --> 00:01:27,662
so they sent it here from a great distance

33
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:28,811
only one roll

34
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:31,922
then his majesty ordered the Internal Affairs Authority to made it in a hurry

35
00:01:31,922 --> 00:01:34,085
His Majesty arrive

36
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:35,963
Just talking about him, then he arrives

37
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:39,928
Respects to your majesty

38
00:01:39,928 --> 00:01:41,344
Wish your majesty well

39
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,902
Quickly put on the jade shoes and let me have a look

40
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:53,855
Do they look good?

41
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:55,649
Fits your feet perfectly

42
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,372
Seems like I gave them the right directions

43
00:01:57,372 --> 00:01:58,552
What?

44
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,712
I told the needlework department

45
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:03,960
to make it according to your foot measurements. Indeed I was right.

46
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,563
But I've never told Your Majesty

47
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:08,674
my foot measurements.

48
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:11,172
We've slept next to each other for so long

49
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,632
How could I not know this?

50
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:15,104
I specially instructed the embroidery department

51
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:17,167
to embroider the pattern of mandarin ducks.

52
00:02:18,212 --> 00:02:19,920
Your Majesty

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,511
Huan Huan

54
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:22,829
Have I made you unhappy

55
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:25,539
in some way?

56
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:28,048
Since returning from the travelling palace, you have been occupied by something

57
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:31,210
No, you didn't make me uhappy

58
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:36,051
It's just that you're too good to me

59
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:39,437
It instead makes me a bit scared

60
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:41,176
Don't be scared

61
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:43,944
What I've promised you, I will definitely give you

62
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:45,976
I will protect you

63
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:50,746
Huan Huan knows that you favor me

64
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,907
But in the past, you used to also favor Princess of Glory like this

65
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:57,429
and favor Mei Jiejie.

66
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:01,490
I'm just afraid that it's nothing more than favor

67
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:06,215
Favor is love

68
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:07,958
What if it's favor, but not love?

69
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:16,275
Perhaps Dear 4th will make an exception for me

70
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:20,239
As long as all this favor

71
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,117
contains a bit of love,

72
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:23,729
Huan Huan will be very happy.

73
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,659
Silly words

74
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:38,584
(Poem) When can we sit together and cut the candlewick under the west window

75
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:40,496
and chat about the raining night in Ba (Ba and Shu both refer to Sichuan)

76
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:43,565
Your majesty and I cut the candlewick together

77
00:03:43,565 --> 00:03:47,706
but there's stary sky outside, no raining night to chat about

78
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:50,991
There's starry sky in Beijing

79
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:54,503
17th brother's letter says it rains a lot in Shu

80
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:59,080
luckily, in Ba where he lives, there's beautiful raining night scenery

81
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:02,531
can comfort his tireness in trip

82
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,222
How is it?

83
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:12,918
Things get done quickly when you whip the horse

84
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:15,335
(Poem) A steed galloping up dust wins the imperial concubine's smiling

85
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:19,912
I don't actually like this color

86
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:21,784
One dresses like one lives

87
00:04:21,784 --> 00:04:25,909
grandly and gorgeously

88
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:29,144
Normally Niang Niang likes bright and beautiful colors

89
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,943
Actually this color is elegant too

90
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:34,772
There are no incoming tributes right now

91
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:35,988
Getting these two rolls

92
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:38,452
must have taken a lot of effort too.

93
00:04:39,383 --> 00:04:42,384
Actually, they've put in a lot of thought and effort

94
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:43,694
Niang Niang look

95
00:04:43,694 --> 00:04:46,692
Even these flowers were embroidered with

96
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:48,487
bluish white silk thread mixed in with silver thread.

97
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:51,628
Under the sun, it will definitely be pretty

98
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:55,005
They're rarely this devoted

99
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:56,948
This will also let others know

100
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:58,542
that even the most precious things,

101
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:02,232
if I want them, I will immediately have them.

102
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:05,167
Yes, unlike some people,

103
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:07,713
even if they wear shoes made of Shu silk,

104
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:11,579
it's just like wearing the imperial robe and not even looking like the crown prince.

105
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:15,073
Then tell the embroidery department to make this into clothes

106
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:19,132
Everything else looks fine,

107
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:22,253
but why have I never seen this floral pattern before?

108
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:23,195
Right

109
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:26,053
Before, there were only peonies and phoenix

110
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:28,439
This is quite fresh

111
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,715
Come look, what flower is this?

112
00:05:34,832 --> 00:05:38,746
Young mistress, this is the morning glory, also called sunset

113
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:40,462
So unelegant

114
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:43,324
This flower only blooms for one night

115
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:44,665
and withers away in the morning.

116
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:48,077
Shut up! Don't say such inauspicious things!

117
00:05:48,077 --> 00:05:49,358
*****!

118
00:05:49,358 --> 00:05:51,730
This embroidery department is getting more and more out of control!

119
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,335
They actually dare fool me with such a short-lived flower!

120
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:56,388
Songzhi

121
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:56,838
Yes.

122
00:05:56,838 --> 00:05:58,641
Rip up these two rolls of cloth!

123
00:05:58,641 --> 00:05:59,832
Take them back to the embroidery department!

124
00:05:59,832 --> 00:06:00,410
Yes.

125
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,317
Niang Niang, most people don't know this flower

126
00:06:03,317 --> 00:06:05,266
It's possible they made an honest mistake

127
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:07,277
The ripping itself is not a big deal

128
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:09,149
but if others hear about this,

129
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:11,083
it will only stir up more gossip.

130
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,015
Since most people don't know this flower,

131
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,410
Niang Niang can pretend not to know

132
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,409
and give it to someone else.

133
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,661
Then let's give it to her

134
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,680
Who?

135
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,900
She already has that pair of shoes

136
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,804
Matched with this outfit,

137
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:29,565
will definitely look like someone in his majesty's heart

138
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:35,900
Jiejie, you finally come back

139
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,199
you and An jiejie all went to the Yuan Ming Palace

140
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,556
only left me here

141
00:06:39,556 --> 00:06:40,851
really bored me

142
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:42,751
Gugu was accompanying you

143
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:44,604
Gugu scold me all the time

144
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,843
says I'm mouthy

145
00:06:45,843 --> 00:06:47,574
asks me to be quiet

146
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,369
she told me if I can be quiet, I'll win favor just like An Jiejie

147
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:53,420
Gugu teachs you, you should listen

148
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,641
Gugu also said I have been in the palace for one year

149
00:06:56,641 --> 00:06:58,139
but haven't even talked with his majesty

150
00:06:59,108 --> 00:07:01,364
said I made noises all days

151
00:07:01,364 --> 00:07:04,440
actually, when I meet his majesty, there will be more rules

152
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,615
I don't want

153
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:08,998
Say these words after you meet his Majesty

154
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:12,587
Young mistress, Palace of Wings' Zhou Gonggong come

155
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:18,269
Respects to Precious Smile

156
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:19,372
stand up

157
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,577
Thanks

158
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:25,778
Princess of Glory got two roll of Shu silk recently

159
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,695
the color is light

160
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:31,072
so made it into two clothes, and give them to young mistress

161
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,787
Many thanks to Niangniang

162
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,380
Jinxi, take it

163
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:40,606
Replying to Niang Niang,

164
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:42,213
the color is elegant

165
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:43,904
and the craftsmanship is excellent.

166
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:49,055
But the Precious Flower Hall's priest said

167
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:51,487
Precious should be restrained from mouse

168
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:56,594
even the homophone should be careful (mouse also pronounce Shu)

169
00:07:56,594 --> 00:08:00,435
It's fine if you wear the Shu silk under your feet

170
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:02,222
as shoes,

171
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:03,559
but to wear as clothes,

172
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:06,456
I'm afraid you will have to wait until next year.

173
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:08,311
Jinxi means that

174
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:12,000
young mistress cannot wear the clothes that Niang Niang granted?

175
00:08:12,763 --> 00:08:16,328
Young mistress is now the emperor's new pet

176
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:17,870
Other than gifts from the emperor,

177
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,589
she looks down on things from everyone else.

178
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:22,808
Our Niang Niang often says

179
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:24,554
if one is kind-hearted, she'll not be afraid of evil things

180
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:26,666
Definitely, priest's words can't be distrusted

181
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,356
but Niangniang's kind will protect you

182
00:08:29,356 --> 00:08:32,557
it wil be good for young mistress

183
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:34,315
Jinxi was only kindly reminding me

184
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:35,630
Gong Gong need not take it to heart

185
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,312
Report back to Niang Niang

186
00:08:38,312 --> 00:08:39,698
that I will go thank her another day.

187
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:43,125
Then servant is leaving

188
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,744
Let me see

189
00:08:53,922 --> 00:08:55,722
This looks really nice

190
00:08:56,457 --> 00:08:59,011
Why is Jiejie unhappy about getting clothes?

191
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:01,812
What flower is this?

192
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,819
Haven't seen it before

193
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:07,733
This is sunset, or morning glory

194
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:10,094
Morning glory?

195
00:09:15,184 --> 00:09:17,327
This flower is pretty

196
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,528
But this gift came too suddenly from Princess of Glory

197
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:23,268
Servant doesn't understand

198
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:26,394
Not only you

199
00:09:26,394 --> 00:09:28,783
all sudden things must come with odd

200
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:32,294
Jiejie, this clothes

201
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:35,249
just matches your Shu-silk-made shoes

202
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:36,629
If you wear them to the Pageant of Enjoying Chrysanthemum in October

203
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:39,280
you will certainly stand out from all people

204
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:41,932
Put it away first

205
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,782
Respects to Empress Dowager

206
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:02,187
Stand up

207
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:03,469
Thanks

208
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:05,604
sit

209
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:13,215
Why do you come today

210
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:15,610
It is my duty to serve Empress Dowager

211
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,085
His majesty is busy in political affairs

212
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:20,520
I shoulde take care of you more

213
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,477
you are more and more honeymouthed

214
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:26,680
it is already autumn, and cold at night

215
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,242
is Empress Dowager still coughing

216
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:30,387
It's getting better now

217
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:32,818
I know you are afraid of cold

218
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:36,118
so I ordered them to made this fox cloak

219
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:45,302
It is black fox's fur

220
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:46,513
Yes

221
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,015
my brother is countering the insurgency in Qinghai

222
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,797
he got two pieces ofblack fox's fur during hunting

223
00:10:51,797 --> 00:10:53,650
I think I am too young

224
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,420
can't wear its vigour out

225
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,266
so I made a cloak to you

226
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:01,893
I know Empress Dowager respects Buddah

227
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:05,523
so I used the Indian lotus patterned silk to make the lining

228
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:09,341
hope that Empress Dowager will like it

229
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,534
Your filial piety is hard to come by

230
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:14,259
Zhuxi, take it

231
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:15,437
Yes

232
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:21,124
Why are you dressed so plainly today?

233
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:24,696
Although I'm young and immature,

234
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:27,205
I'm no longer young compared to the other wives.

235
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:29,034
I should dress more plainly

236
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:31,126
Unlike Precious Smile and Lingering An

237
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:33,620
who like to dress beautifully and youthfully.

238
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,342
I often hear you mention Precious Smile

239
00:11:36,342 --> 00:11:38,005
I only remember

240
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:40,238
she is good looking

241
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:44,369
It's a pity Empress Dowager hasn't seen her lately

242
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:48,557
His majesty gave her a pair of shoes made of Shu silk as present

243
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:50,832
even the soles are made of green jade

244
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:54,131
Precious Smile also had two outfits made from Shu silk

245
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:57,994
She looks beautiful in them

246
00:11:57,994 --> 00:11:59,524
Is that true?

247
00:11:59,524 --> 00:12:01,245
But I remember

248
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:03,770
that now is not the time for Shu silk tributes.

249
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:06,491
Precious Smile is young and likeable

250
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:08,558
Is there anything she can't have?

251
00:12:09,223 --> 00:12:11,723
I just don't know how much her Shu silk attire

252
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:13,058
cost in total.

253
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:19,254
She just entered the palace, and the emperor treats her like a little kid

254
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:21,055
Of course she would be pampered a bit more

255
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:24,570
You has been favored for many years, have the sense of propriety

256
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,999
you should teach her

257
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:29,096
Yes

258
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:36,341
In my opinion, His Majesty still cares about you the most

259
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:37,928
The Huanyi fragrance that you use

260
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:40,028
His Majesty personally chose the perfumes that went into it,

261
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:41,822
then had it prepared and brought to you.

262
00:12:41,822 --> 00:12:43,350
Take a look at the entire palace

263
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,118
Who else has he treated this thoughtfully?

264
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:50,624
Come over here

265
00:12:58,614 --> 00:13:00,229
I dare not accept

266
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:01,895
Here

267
00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:05,969
When I first became De Fei,

268
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:07,963
Empress Dowager Xiao Hui granted me this hair ornament.

269
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,947
You're still young and beautiful, like a flower

270
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:12,494
You also have respectable status

271
00:13:12,494 --> 00:13:14,794
Why dress so plainly?

272
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,438
I think that this hair ornament is just right for you

273
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:21,663
Many thanks for Empress Dowager's tender love

274
00:13:21,663 --> 00:13:24,967
I love you just like I love His Majesty

275
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:28,281
Quickly change into more colorful clothes

276
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:30,303
and show His Majesty.

277
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:33,333
Then I will take my leave

278
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:57,972
Niang Niang's hairpin is so pretty

279
00:13:57,972 --> 00:13:59,940
but we weren't able to vent our spleen

280
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,268
what a pity

281
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:02,881
no need your mention

282
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:07,563
but it's great to get Empress Dowager's tender love

283
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:08,663
Right

284
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:10,537
Light the sandalwood

285
00:14:10,537 --> 00:14:12,691
and bring me the Fahua Scriptures

286
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,345
Empress Dowager also think there's too much jealousy in the room

287
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:17,877
and have to disperse?

288
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:21,520
Jealousy is common in the inner palace

289
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,600
no need to be surprised

290
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,723
servant also don't care about such jealousy

291
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:28,600
but Princess of Glory did so much work

292
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,147
we can see Precious Smile is not simple

293
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:33,359
you know Princess of Glory

294
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:35,198
she is always jealous on little things

295
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:36,827
has never changed

296
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:40,025
but it's also his majesty's fault

297
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:43,747
old as he is, he can't take everything into consideration

298
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:45,388
make me worried

299
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:47,098
Empress Dowager are worried?

300
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:50,181
you are the one who should enjoy life most

301
00:14:53,248 --> 00:14:55,471
Go to the Hall of a resting soul

302
00:14:55,471 --> 00:14:58,789
tell his majesty to come after finishing his work

303
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:00,288
Yes

304
00:15:13,556 --> 00:15:15,760
His majesty comes

305
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:22,895
Respects to imperial mother

306
00:15:22,895 --> 00:15:24,670
Sit

307
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,230
It's getting cold these days

308
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,280
why not wear more clothes

309
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,003
I came out from the Hall of a resting soul just now

310
00:15:31,003 --> 00:15:32,437
and don't feel cold at the moment

311
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:35,304
Why didn't Su Peisheng remind you

312
00:15:36,675 --> 00:15:39,445
It's my fault, please forgive me

313
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:42,787
Su Peisheng works hard

314
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:44,479
but he can't make everything perfect

315
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:46,796
with only his own efforts

316
00:15:46,796 --> 00:15:48,484
since imperial mother said so

317
00:15:48,484 --> 00:15:50,926
I'll wear more clothes when go back

318
00:15:50,926 --> 00:15:52,527
Never mind

319
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:54,893
Su Peisheng, stand up

320
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:56,578
Thanke for your forgiveness

321
00:15:56,578 --> 00:15:59,890
I'll do my best to serve his majesty later on

322
00:16:01,387 --> 00:16:03,388
Speaking of this

323
00:16:03,388 --> 00:16:06,947
not only does the servants have to watch out for these things

324
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:10,022
the concubines should watch out too

325
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:15,967
Is that Precious Smile dedicated enough?

326
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:18,065
This is hard to say

327
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:19,886
If I say she is,

328
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:22,755
today I wore less for the coolness,

329
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:25,597
Imperial Mother will surely scold her for not being dedicated enough

330
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,838
You will also scold me for being bias

331
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:30,413
But if I say she is not dedicated,

332
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:34,831
she is actually an attentive person

333
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:41,377
It's just that I have been busy with the affairs of the state <br> <br> I have not seen her in several days

334
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:45,469
Your majesty said you're not bias

335
00:16:46,195 --> 00:16:48,869
this is the real bias

336
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:50,883
Don't laugh at me, Gugu

337
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:54,707
Your majesty are busy with the affairs of the state

338
00:16:54,707 --> 00:16:57,842
but it's only been several days since you've last seen her

339
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:00,685
Then how often do you see the Princess of Glory?

340
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:03,260
How often do you see the Empress?

341
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:05,881
How often do you see the Pin of Respects and the others?

342
00:17:08,258 --> 00:17:09,919
Since Your Majesty is busy

343
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:13,953
it's fine if you see everyone in the harem less often

344
00:17:13,953 --> 00:17:16,454
but if you appear to have too much of a favoritism

345
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:19,100
you will hurt the concubines' feelings

346
00:17:21,717 --> 00:17:23,426
Imperial Mother is right

347
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:25,527
I will remember this

348
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:30,272
This fine black fox skin

349
00:17:30,272 --> 00:17:33,034
you will only find it in Qinghai

350
00:17:34,906 --> 00:17:36,964
Your majesty has bright eyes and a clear heart

351
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:40,722
It's so dim in the palace and yet you can tell it's black fox skin

352
00:17:40,722 --> 00:17:44,473
The inner palace and the court are obviously as clear as a flame to you

353
00:17:48,045 --> 00:17:51,806
This black fox cloak is made from black fox skins

354
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:54,022
Princess of Glory specifically chose

355
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:56,503
Indian lotus patterned silk as the lining

356
00:17:57,082 --> 00:18:00,421
This is appropriate inside and out and bring out the best in each other

357
00:18:02,318 --> 00:18:05,773
I understand Imperial Mother's lessons perfectly

358
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:08,652
I heard that today

359
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:10,972
Imperial Mother gave the Princess of Glory a hair ornament

360
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:16,789
I believe it should be even more glorious under the candle light

361
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:20,288
I will have to take the time to admire it

362
00:18:21,498 --> 00:18:26,138
You have to balance kindness and power not only in court

363
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,496
but also in the inner palace

364
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:33,766
The pacification of Northwest is coming to an end

365
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:37,323
but the Tusi in the Southwest is still a big concern

366
00:18:37,323 --> 00:18:40,457
It'll take a lot of trouble to gain stability

367
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:44,374
Nian Gengyao is talented and loyal

368
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,671
As long as he doesn't get too arrogant

369
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:50,003
Your majesty should use him well

370
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:53,263
It's a great merit to calm the western frontier

371
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,075
Nian Gengyao will come to the capital in October,

372
00:18:58,075 --> 00:19:00,823
I will reward him nicely

373
00:19:03,596 --> 00:19:06,081
The Princess of Glory ran out of the Huanyi fragrance

374
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:08,596
This fragrance is difficult to make

375
00:19:09,677 --> 00:19:12,601
Your Majesty is not giving her any more?

376
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:15,731
For many years she is accustomed to using it

377
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:18,339
I will definitely give her more

378
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:27,090
Niang Niang

379
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,289
My brother is back?

380
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:30,733
The general has calm the western frontier and came back to the capital to pay respects

381
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,242
He went to see His Majesty

382
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,446
His Majesty has always been very kind to the general

383
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:37,599
they must have many important things to talk about right now

384
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,518
Of course

385
00:19:39,518 --> 00:19:42,576
but it's almost lunch time

386
00:19:42,576 --> 00:19:45,157
Even if His Majesty and Brother have important things to discuss

387
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:46,547
they still have to eat

388
00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:47,992
Report to Niang Niang

389
00:19:50,015 --> 00:19:51,353
His Majesty has ordered

390
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:54,135
Niang Niang to come to Hall of a resting soul for lunch

391
00:19:59,471 --> 00:20:00,844
Wait outside

392
00:20:00,844 --> 00:20:02,379
I will come right away

393
00:20:02,976 --> 00:20:06,221
They have many dishes in the palace

394
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:08,370
but I don't know if they are to your liking

395
00:20:09,097 --> 00:20:10,738
Just try them

396
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:12,856
if you really don't like them

397
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:15,839
I will have the Princess of Glory's small kitchen make more

398
00:20:17,144 --> 00:20:19,558
I dare not receive this honour

399
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:23,470
To be able to dine with Your Majesty and the Princess of Glory

400
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,774
it is already the greatest of honour

401
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:27,042
Sit down

402
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:29,891
We are eating as a family

403
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:32,261
if you stand and sit at every turn

404
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:34,820
to give thanks and to apologize, what fun is left?

405
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,291
Sit

406
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,850
Thank you Your Majesty, thank you Princess of Glory

407
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:48,632
This roasted mutton is fresh, tender, and tasty

408
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:52,372
I really like this dish. Try it.

409
00:21:01,572 --> 00:21:03,187
Indeed tasty

410
00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:05,155
Many thanks Your Majesty

411
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:09,562
Brother

412
00:21:09,562 --> 00:21:11,398
When His Majesty grants you a feast,

413
00:21:11,398 --> 00:21:13,659
you must be served by the attendants.

414
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:18,016
I lost my manners

415
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:19,637
Your Majesty, be sure not to blame me

416
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:24,658
You have been fighting battles out there all this time

417
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:29,543
You can't possibly be mindful of every single thing. It's not important.

418
00:21:29,543 --> 00:21:32,565
When I'm in the palace, I can't ignore the rules

419
00:21:33,503 --> 00:21:36,502
You eat however you want

420
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:40,126
The rules are to remind one of the etiquette between the ruler and his ministers

421
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:43,008
but not for restricting relatives

422
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:44,117
Yes

423
00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:00,184
This bird's nest and duck in front of me looks pretty good

424
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,792
I will trouble Su Gong Gong

425
00:22:35,545 --> 00:22:37,493
Great General, enjoy

426
00:22:42,117 --> 00:22:45,542
In only 15 days time,

427
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:48,908
you crushed Tibetan Prince Danjin's troops.

428
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:51,793
These 8 months,

429
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:54,525
you wiped out all the remaining enemy troops, one by one.

430
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,776
You helped me calm the northwest and the western frontiers

431
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,852
You're like a savior to me

432
00:23:07,343 --> 00:23:10,730
I dare not accept Your Majesty's praise

433
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:13,315
I have not been at the throne for long

434
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:16,865
Inside and outside the court, not everything is completely stable yet

435
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:20,540
Not to mention the stupid princes in the palace,

436
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,262
with the disorder in the border region,

437
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:25,672
I am attacked from both front and back. It is hard to take everything in.

438
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:28,275
Your great service

439
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:32,556
not only will I reward you

440
00:23:32,556 --> 00:23:34,142
me,

441
00:23:34,142 --> 00:23:39,026
my descendants and all my subjects

442
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:41,636
will feel pleased will all our hearts

443
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:46,874
If anyone shall betray you, they will not be my descendants

444
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:50,784
If anyone shall be disloyal, they will not be my subjects

445
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,880
Princess of Glory is devoted to you inside the palace

446
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,817
I am devoted to you outside

447
00:23:56,817 --> 00:23:59,234
We brother and sister are willing to dedicate ourselves entirely to Your Majesty,

448
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:02,624
and serve you with all our energy.

449
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:07,566
Princess of Glory has served me many years

450
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,683
She has always been thorough and considerate

451
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:17,812
You have been out there serving as my right arm

452
00:24:18,806 --> 00:24:21,288
To have you as my commanding general of the border provinces

453
00:24:21,288 --> 00:24:22,727
is my fortune.

454
00:24:23,284 --> 00:24:27,223
If I had ten people like you in court,

455
00:24:27,223 --> 00:24:29,929
I wouldn't have to worry about not governing the country well.

456
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:31,448
Thanks Your Majesty

457
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:38,236
I toast this cup to you brother and sister

458
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:43,419
Many thanks Your Majesty

459
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:44,984
Thanks Your Majesty

460
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:52,667
Yes

461
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:58,566
Is it peaceful in the Yunnan-Guizhou and Shanxi regions?

462
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,304
Everything is fine

463
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:03,099
It's just that before coming to the palace,

464
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:07,593
I heard that the Zhuozi mountain region's Xieersu tribe is not very stable,

465
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:09,252
and may cause trouble.

466
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,746
As expected, I received news yesterday

467
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:16,346
they caused trouble in Zhuanglang county of Gansu province

468
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:21,015
They are just a motley crowd<br><br> I believe it will be settled quickly

469
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:23,692
Your Majesty is exactly right

470
00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:25,965
But I heard that

471
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:27,146
the Xieersu tribe secretly plans to

472
00:25:27,146 --> 00:25:30,568
form an alliance with Xinjiang's Ge Erdan.

473
00:25:30,568 --> 00:25:33,100
This cannot be taken lightly

474
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,899
Then what do you think of this?

475
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:37,312
Xieersu is just a small tribe

476
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:40,826
it'll be too much of a fuss to send a general

477
00:25:40,826 --> 00:25:42,482
and lose our dignity

478
00:25:43,606 --> 00:25:47,887
But if we don't do something, they will become troubles

479
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:50,164
So, I presumptuously recommend

480
00:25:50,164 --> 00:25:52,633
my second son Nian Fu to fight the battle.

481
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:55,331
Although he's young, he's had some practice and experience

482
00:25:55,331 --> 00:25:57,349
I want to give him a try

483
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:02,612
Your Majesty, I shouldn't interfere in politics

484
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:06,315
It's not suitable for me to stay here and listen to you discuss national affairs with brother

485
00:26:07,448 --> 00:26:10,432
I am discussing both national and family affairs with your brother

486
00:26:10,432 --> 00:26:13,133
It's alright

487
00:26:14,195 --> 00:26:15,985
Princess of Glory is right

488
00:26:15,985 --> 00:26:19,791
I rarely get to share a meal with Your Majesty

489
00:26:20,148 --> 00:26:23,214
We shouldn't discuss other things at a family reunion

490
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,419
Good

491
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:37,027
Then let's just eat

492
00:26:41,547 --> 00:26:42,886
The weather is getting cold

493
00:26:42,886 --> 00:26:46,145
Starting October 15, every meal in the palace comes in a pot

494
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:48,987
For Brother's visit today,

495
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:50,128
although it's only the 14th,

496
00:26:50,128 --> 00:26:53,761
His Majesty still had the imperial kitchen prepare this assorted pot dish.

497
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:57,914
You must thank His Majesty

498
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:00,748
Thanks Your Majesty for your kindness

499
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,776
The pot dish will warm you up

500
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,919
You and I, our hearts are linked

501
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:14,283
I will also feel warmer inside my heart

502
00:27:14,283 --> 00:27:15,275
Yes

503
00:27:15,904 --> 00:27:17,352
Quickly eat

504
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:18,294
Yes

505
00:27:24,051 --> 00:27:25,965
Servant bids farewell to Princess of Glory

506
00:27:26,682 --> 00:27:28,248
and Great General Nian.

507
00:27:32,031 --> 00:27:33,531
Brother, brother

508
00:27:33,531 --> 00:27:36,090
I was scared and anxious during this whole meal

509
00:27:37,677 --> 00:27:39,504
What's the matter?

510
00:27:39,504 --> 00:27:41,956
His Majesty said he liked to eat that roasted mutton dish

511
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:43,112
Before he even moved his chopsticks,

512
00:27:43,112 --> 00:27:45,077
how could you move yours?

513
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:46,498
Never mind that

514
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,559
Then you had Su Peisheng serve you the dish!

515
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,200
Who is Su Peisheng?

516
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,851
He was the emperor's personal eunuch for several decades!

517
00:27:52,851 --> 00:27:54,362
He's worked for the emperor since they were kids

518
00:27:54,362 --> 00:27:56,041
And you dare order him around?

519
00:27:57,714 --> 00:27:59,833
You know my temper

520
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:02,204
I hate the stench of these castrated people!

521
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:07,215
Since I can not disobey the rules of the palace

522
00:28:07,215 --> 00:28:10,764
of course I have to get the most esteemed eunuch to serve me

523
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:13,624
I'll say something unpleasant,

524
00:28:13,624 --> 00:28:17,140
I just came back from the battle fields <br> <br>and earned great merits

525
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,471
and I can't even have a eunuch serve me?

526
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:23,308
He serves His Majesty and serves me

527
00:28:23,699 --> 00:28:26,837
it's no big deal to serve Brother once

528
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:28,964
Don't do it again

529
00:28:30,864 --> 00:28:34,671
Li Bai has little literary talent and yet he made Gao Lishi (a eunuch) take his shoes off

530
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:38,147
It's Su Peisheng's blessings to serve me

531
00:28:38,645 --> 00:28:40,685
There's more,

532
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,313
there are things His Majesty can say

533
00:28:42,313 --> 00:28:43,931
but you shouldn't say

534
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:46,522
When His Majesty say we are a family, that's courtesy

535
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:49,704
When Brother say we are a family, that's overstepping

536
00:28:49,704 --> 00:28:52,295
Brother, you didn't even drink <br><br> why are you drunk?

537
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:55,896
I say Sister

538
00:28:55,896 --> 00:28:59,198
you've stayed in the palace for too long <br><br> and you heart has gotten smaller

539
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:02,250
I was just going along with His Majesty

540
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,143
After all, we are a family

541
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:07,382
You are his beloved concubine

542
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:09,238
I am his brother-in-law

543
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:11,009
aren't we close relatives?

544
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:14,566
Amitabha, fortunately His Majesty didn't blame you

545
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:17,010
and even let you escort me back to the palace before returning

546
00:29:17,734 --> 00:29:19,522
I don't think he's mad

547
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,050
What's wrong with you?

548
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:28,062
Did the Empress do something?

549
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,514
How can the Empress do anything?

550
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:36,530
It's His Majesty's new Precious Smile who's acting clever

551
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:39,716
alienating and going against me

552
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,595
It's because of her

553
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:44,154
His Majesty took away my privileges to rule the inner palace

554
00:29:44,154 --> 00:29:45,569
and never returned it since

555
00:29:46,276 --> 00:29:49,488
A little Precious dare to offend you?

556
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:53,025
His Majesty favours her, what can I do?

557
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:58,253
I heard his father is in court too

558
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:01,672
What is his name?

559
00:30:01,672 --> 00:30:02,905
Zhen Yuandao

560
00:30:04,793 --> 00:30:06,562
Fine

561
00:30:06,562 --> 00:30:08,854
If his daughter is against you

562
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:10,741
I will be against him

563
00:30:12,282 --> 00:30:14,043
Fortunately there's Brother to watch out for me

564
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:18,059
If not...If not, how much grievance will I have to endure?

565
00:30:19,772 --> 00:30:22,235
Brother is here, what are you afraid of?

566
00:30:27,595 --> 00:30:29,647
Your Majesty, General Nian is back

567
00:30:31,076 --> 00:30:32,382
Your Majesty

568
00:30:35,128 --> 00:30:36,143
Sit down

569
00:30:40,492 --> 00:30:43,650
I will obey

570
00:30:48,591 --> 00:30:50,348
Great General, please have tea

571
00:30:54,764 --> 00:30:56,591
Your Majesty

572
00:30:56,591 --> 00:31:00,797
I informed you of the grand coordinator Zhao Zhihen

573
00:31:00,797 --> 00:31:03,977
he is not qualified to be the grand coordinator

574
00:31:03,977 --> 00:31:06,569
what do you think

575
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:08,341
Since you think he is useless

576
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,119
I'll dismiss him

577
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:14,448
Your majesty is wise

578
00:31:16,782 --> 00:31:23,772
You and I are general and emperor outside, but relatives inside

579
00:31:24,447 --> 00:31:26,739
If I were not a extraordinary emperor

580
00:31:27,656 --> 00:31:30,121
I would disappoint your loyalty

581
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:30,935
Right

582
00:31:30,935 --> 00:31:33,973
If you were not a extraordinary general

583
00:31:34,556 --> 00:31:38,142
you would disappoint my promoting you

584
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:41,831
you and I

585
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:44,223
should set examples in history

586
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:48,326
I'll do my best

587
00:31:48,326 --> 00:31:51,355
to live up to your majesty's grace

588
00:31:52,766 --> 00:31:54,572
just set back

589
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,545
always thank me

590
00:31:57,545 --> 00:31:59,520
I'm tired with it

591
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,339
Yes, I'll obey

592
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:05,416
I appreciate your meritorious service

593
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:09,318
so I reward you a hat with peacock feather

594
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:11,331
a suit with four dragons

595
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:13,619
yellow belt, purple rope, and a thousand taels of gold

596
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,352
you must be tired today

597
00:32:19,352 --> 00:32:21,546
just go back and rest

598
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:23,163
come another day

599
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:28,017
I

600
00:32:28,017 --> 00:32:29,915
thank your grace

601
00:32:45,643 --> 00:32:46,397
Niangniang

602
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:48,591
Xiao Xiazi heard it clearly

603
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,375
his majesty called general Nian benefactor

604
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,896
Niangniang

605
00:32:57,628 --> 00:32:58,671
Jianqiu

606
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:03,959
why does the weather get cold so quickly

607
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:05,775
because the northwestern wind start to blow

608
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,372
how about I bring you some clothes

609
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:13,073
the weather is cold, wearing more clothes is of no use

610
00:33:14,607 --> 00:33:17,060
These days, every time his majesty came to the inner palaces

611
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,353
he only went to Princess of Glory

612
00:33:19,353 --> 00:33:22,165
not even set a foot in our Palace of Benevolent Hope

613
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:26,442
The Palace of Benevolent Hope is always cold

614
00:33:26,442 --> 00:33:28,982
Only his majesty come, it will be warm

615
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:33,901
But now, it really gets cold

616
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:38,827
Someday, his majesty think of paying a debt of gratitude

617
00:33:38,827 --> 00:33:43,075
and give the Palace of Benevolent Hope to Princess of Glory

618
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:47,490
it will be truely warm

619
00:33:52,218 --> 00:33:54,997
Your majesty is always accompanying me recently

620
00:33:54,997 --> 00:33:57,199
why not go and see other sisters

621
00:33:58,943 --> 00:34:00,959
Since you are so generous

622
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,664
then I'll go and see Princess of Regularity

623
00:34:05,664 --> 00:34:07,510
Your majesty

624
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,214
I'm just saying

625
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,260
It is dark outside

626
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,072
you'd better not go out

627
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:14,989
I know you are grudging

628
00:34:16,976 --> 00:34:20,454
I remember when you just came into Prince's House

629
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,232
I was always accompanying you

630
00:34:24,225 --> 00:34:29,418
somtimes, I even desolated Yixiu, who had just become my legal wife

631
00:34:30,543 --> 00:34:32,262
Before I came into Prince's House

632
00:34:32,262 --> 00:34:34,488
your majesty had spent lots of time with Empress

633
00:34:35,193 --> 00:34:37,248
Empress came into Prince's House early

634
00:34:37,248 --> 00:34:41,725
your majesty should spend more time with me, that will be equal

635
00:34:41,725 --> 00:34:45,170
I also want to spend more time with you

636
00:34:46,532 --> 00:34:49,313
but now I am the emperor of the nation

637
00:34:50,194 --> 00:34:52,777
I have so many affairs to deal with

638
00:34:52,777 --> 00:34:54,656
and there are more people in the inner palaces

639
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:58,168
I can't desolate all the others only because of you

640
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:01,034
Saying like this

641
00:35:01,584 --> 00:35:05,746
you must think about others when accompanying me

642
00:35:06,775 --> 00:35:11,376
you are angry with me

643
00:35:12,419 --> 00:35:15,228
before, in the Prince's House, you are my second legal wife

644
00:35:15,686 --> 00:35:17,256
now your are the princess

645
00:35:18,106 --> 00:35:20,505
it's more complicated in the palaces

646
00:35:20,505 --> 00:35:23,201
you should be relieved and look out for me

647
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:29,460
Empress is physically weak, you should take more responsibility

648
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:32,118
I know

649
00:35:39,591 --> 00:35:41,495
Sister is so interested in it

650
00:35:41,495 --> 00:35:43,178
you have been working on the Baihe fragrance's recipe

651
00:35:43,178 --> 00:35:45,454
for seven or eight days, but not tired

652
00:35:46,694 --> 00:35:50,811
the night is long and lonely, I have to do something to kill time

653
00:35:51,878 --> 00:35:53,814
His majesty didn't come to see you either

654
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,627
He came and had lunch 6 days ago

655
00:35:57,627 --> 00:35:59,185
then never came again

656
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:03,092
Sister remembers it so clearly

657
00:36:03,092 --> 00:36:05,669
I can't even remember

658
00:36:05,669 --> 00:36:08,199
about half a month

659
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:11,447
but I shouldn't complain

660
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:13,012
I heard Princess of Regularity say

661
00:36:13,012 --> 00:36:15,376
she hasn't seen his majesty since we came back

662
00:36:17,493 --> 00:36:19,240
All the flowers have been killed since autum came

663
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,031
only Princess of Glory is standing out

664
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:24,716
she is happy about it, we should be happy about our own thing

665
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:30,888
Sister is feeling sick?

666
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:34,968
I cought a cold this morning. Just need rest for some days,

667
00:36:34,968 --> 00:36:36,140
It doesn't matter

668
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:41,060
Actually, the process of making Baihe fragrance has lost

669
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,616
now it is rare even in the palaces

670
00:36:43,616 --> 00:36:46,063
If everything is ready, it will be boring

671
00:36:46,063 --> 00:36:48,909
to kill time, I have to find it myself

672
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:51,325
Besides, if I can make it

673
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:53,710
it is the best to use in winter

674
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,590
Put it into stoves

675
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,519
you'll feel like get into the sea of flowers

676
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,508
Yes.

677
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:02,830
Luckly, before my father became an official, he had been a fragrance merchant for many years

678
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,579
and got many recipes of making fragrance

679
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:07,325
I have thought it over for a few days

680
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,512
and finally I figured out there are several kinds of perfume that could be useful

681
00:37:09,512 --> 00:37:11,629
Good, you say and I write it down

682
00:37:13,704 --> 00:37:16,560
Your majesty likes listening to Lingering An's singing

683
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,601
I haven't heard her voice for several days

684
00:37:19,268 --> 00:37:22,728
How about asking her to come and sing

685
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:26,919
so that I can enjoy with your majesty

686
00:37:26,919 --> 00:37:30,370
It's too late, why bother to let her come

687
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,760
Your Majesty!

688
00:37:34,402 --> 00:37:37,299
If you really want, then ask her to come

689
00:37:40,596 --> 00:37:42,554
Zhou Ninghai,

690
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:43,454
Here

691
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,802
Go and invite

692
00:37:45,802 --> 00:37:46,656
Yes

693
00:37:57,554 --> 00:38:00,095
Sister,you have written all your worries on it

694
00:38:00,095 --> 00:38:01,403
What?

695
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:06,041
sister is erudite,

696
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:09,640
why you forgot a part of this word<br><br>Where did that part go

697
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,438
sister's heart has gone with his majesty

698
00:38:11,438 --> 00:38:13,276
and this part also flew away

699
00:38:14,023 --> 00:38:15,908
you're more and more smooth-tongued

700
00:38:15,908 --> 00:38:18,347
I wish that his majesty ask you to go now

701
00:38:18,347 --> 00:38:19,213
then you can be quiet

702
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,059
Who is smooth-tongued

703
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:22,689
sister is timorous yourself

704
00:38:22,689 --> 00:38:24,553
look at it yourself

705
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:33,019
Respect to Precious Smile and Lingering An

706
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,837
wish you auspicious

707
00:38:34,837 --> 00:38:36,261
Why is Zhou Gonggong coming

708
00:38:37,695 --> 00:38:40,326
His majesty want to listen to Lingering An's singing

709
00:38:40,326 --> 00:38:42,411
He's waiting at the Palace of Wings

710
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:48,809
His majesty is with Princess of Glory

711
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:50,899
What am I if I were there

712
00:38:50,899 --> 00:38:53,813
How about tomorrow

713
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:55,463
His majesty is waiting right now

714
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:57,032
If you want to go against the order

715
00:38:57,032 --> 00:38:59,592
you should reply yourself

716
00:38:59,592 --> 00:39:02,171
don't give us servants hard work

717
00:39:07,953 --> 00:39:10,462
Jinxi, bring me my zither

718
00:39:10,462 --> 00:39:11,618
Young mistress

719
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:16,603
Acapella is monotonous, I'd like to go with Lingering An

720
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:18,596
and play the zither for his majesty

721
00:39:21,038 --> 00:39:24,669
Will niangniang mind?

722
00:39:24,669 --> 00:39:26,396
Young mistress is willing to play the zither and add to the fun

723
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:28,584
Niangniang must be pleased

724
00:39:28,584 --> 00:39:30,514
Then, please

725
00:39:45,598 --> 00:39:48,325
Respects to your majesty. Respects to Princess of Glory

726
00:39:52,628 --> 00:39:53,698
Stand up

727
00:39:53,698 --> 00:39:55,373
Thank your Majesty

728
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:56,843
Precious Smile

729
00:39:57,727 --> 00:40:00,453
it's late at night, why are you here

730
00:40:03,386 --> 00:40:08,454
