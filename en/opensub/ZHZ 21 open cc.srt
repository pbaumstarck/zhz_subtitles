00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,667
<i > ~ Episode 21 ~

2
00:00:04,423 --> 00:00:06,116
Precious Smile

3
00:00:06,116 --> 00:00:08,774
Why are you here in the middle of the night?

4
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:10,819
Because it's the middle of the night,

5
00:00:10,819 --> 00:00:12,679
Lingrong Meimei must not travel alone.

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,447
So I came to keep her company

7
00:00:15,447 --> 00:00:17,296
Jiejie is a master instrument player

8
00:00:17,296 --> 00:00:19,697
I was afraid that the song alone would be monotonous

9
00:00:19,697 --> 00:00:23,356
so I specially invited her to come along.

10
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,944
Singing with instrumental accompaniment is of course the best

11
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:32,612
You've been troubled, Precious Smile

12
00:00:33,276 --> 00:00:36,109
I don't know what Princess of Glory likes to listen to

13
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:41,658
The flowers are in full bloom and the moon is full

14
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,415
Sing a romantic song then

15
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:55,825
Yes

16
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:33,218
the song was lovely

17
00:02:33,218 --> 00:02:36,050
but there were no romance

18
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,216
Lingering An, you're not trying to put me off are you?

19
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:42,810
Although this song did not mention love directly

20
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,048
but every word is about the joy of the woman

21
00:02:46,048 --> 00:02:47,668
after the couple proclaimed their love for eachother

22
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:50,999
And the two golden partridges

23
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:53,612
also meant a pair of lovers

24
00:02:54,396 --> 00:02:56,197
If so,

25
00:02:56,197 --> 00:02:59,669
why didn't Lingering An sing it with affection?

26
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:05,869
Did you not sing well because you see His Majesty and I together,

27
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:08,002
and felt unhappy?

28
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:14,564
Replying to Princess of Glory,

29
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:17,049
Lingering An caught a cold in the morning,

30
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:18,504
so her voice is not as usual.

31
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:20,158
What a coincidence

32
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:23,793
Several days ago Lingering An was singing for His Majesty

33
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:26,259
song after song

34
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:28,081
Her voice was just fine!

35
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,345
Songzhi

36
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:32,857
Pour Lingering An a cup of sweet rose wine

37
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:36,565
Fend off the cold, and continue singing

38
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:37,772
Yes

39
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:43,838
Niang Niang, when I'm singing,

40
00:03:43,838 --> 00:03:46,147
I can't consume anything too sweet, greasy, or spicy.

41
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:50,325
You can't sing songs, or drink wine

42
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,631
His Majesty summoned you here

43
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:57,401
It's fine if you disregard me,

44
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:58,804
but His Majesty...

45
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:08,165
Since Princess of Glory granted the wine, just drink it

46
00:04:15,892 --> 00:04:16,834
Yes

47
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:38,135
Pick a good song to sing

48
00:05:00,688 --> 00:05:02,493
Are you alright?

49
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:08,570
Your Majesty and Niang Niang,

50
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:10,944
A song accompanied by music

51
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,481
is definitely the most elegant

52
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:15,280
But sometimes, a poem accompanied by music

53
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,656
can also be refreshing

54
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,550
May I try?

55
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:21,462
Yes

56
00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:25,180
Yes

57
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:28,455
Precious Smile is quite the scholar of the inner palace

58
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:32,182
Alright, His Majesty and I are tired

59
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,730
You've worked hard

60
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:39,233
Zhou Ning Hai

61
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:39,727
Yes

62
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:41,567
Escort them out

63
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,782
Yes

64
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:45,749
We take our leave

65
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,550
Go

66
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:02,882
Your Majesty

67
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:06,316
It's late

68
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:10,631
Go to bed

69
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,299
Young mistresses have worked hard tonight

70
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:23,778
This is Princess of Glory's reward for young mistresses

71
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:26,820
Many thanks

72
00:07:28,952 --> 00:07:31,249
If there's nothing else

73
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:35,170
then servant is leaving.

74
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,923
We're home now

75
00:07:45,686 --> 00:07:47,331
Cry if you want to

76
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:51,520
Jiejie, we're not musical entertainment for sale!

77
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,838
What right does she have to treat us like that?

78
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,025
This jade pendant from her

79
00:07:58,025 --> 00:07:59,600
what a nuisance!

80
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,541
Does she think I'm a singing geisha? Reward?!

81
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,711
Young mistress!

82
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:04,551
Young mistress, be angry if you must

83
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,771
but if you really break this,

84
00:08:05,771 --> 00:08:07,820
who knows what further trouble it will bring.

85
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:14,221
Don't cry

86
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:17,469
Your voice is not well

87
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:19,797
Have some water

88
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:23,660
Jiejie, I let you be humiliated along with me today

89
00:08:24,886 --> 00:08:27,063
If you hadn't been there today,

90
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:28,759
the emperor to keep up appearance's sake,

91
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,492
I don't know how much more torment I would have to endure from her.

92
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:36,950
His Majesty values Nian Gengyao right now

93
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,490
Princess of Glory is very pleased with herself

94
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:41,871
For the sake of the broader situation,

95
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,302
for us

96
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:45,572
His Majesty cannot rip her face too much.

97
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:47,824
I just hope Nian Gengyao leaves soon

98
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,115
so Princess of Glory will be less arrogant.

99
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:52,604
It's not that easy

100
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,819
Leaving aside His Majesty's former feelings for Princess of Glory,

101
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,013
as long as Nian Gengyao is around,

102
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:04,171
His Majesty will not give her the cold shoulder.

103
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,552
As Niang Niang ordered, servant went to the Palace of Wings

104
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:11,154
Originally I wanted to say Empress was sick in bed,

105
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:13,465
so you can't attend the chrysanthemum festival tomorrow

106
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,166
Who knew I'd hear Xiao Xiazi say

107
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,648
that Precious Smile and Lingering An

108
00:09:16,648 --> 00:09:18,347
were performing for Princess of Glory's amusement.

109
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:20,714
I was nosy and stayed around a bit longer

110
00:09:21,222 --> 00:09:23,573
When Precious Smile and Lingering An came out,

111
00:09:23,573 --> 00:09:26,392
they looked normal and nothing much happened

112
00:09:26,392 --> 00:09:29,070
I know Precious Smile's temperament

113
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,774
She's not easily irritable

114
00:09:31,552 --> 00:09:35,385
But I never thought that Lingering An would be able to bear it too.

115
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:39,016
it seems that I have been less observant

116
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:40,636
That's in public

117
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:42,760
Who knows what she's like when she returns home

118
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,267
If she can bear it, of course that's good

119
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:48,610
Princess of Glory is overly arrogant and willful

120
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,139
and humilates others at will

121
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:52,509
In the end, others will humiliate her

122
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:55,274
But this Lingering An

123
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:57,298
She's alright

124
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:04,297
Over here!

125
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:06,884
I'm over here!

126
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:09,062
These plum blossoms are the prettiest!

127
00:10:09,062 --> 00:10:10,793
Young mistress be careful!

128
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:11,588
Can't catch me! Faster!

129
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,162
Faster

130
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:17,424
Young mistress, be careful!

131
00:10:18,228 --> 00:10:19,593
Can't catch me!

132
00:10:20,177 --> 00:10:21,337
Can't catch me!

133
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,272
Young mistress, put on another layer of clothes

134
00:10:31,027 --> 00:10:33,754
it is still snowing. please wear a coat. it will be very cold.

135
00:10:34,754 --> 00:10:38,121
Look

136
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:40,138
I haven't heard this type of laughter for a while

137
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,635
Precious Smile and Lingering An sent over lots of charcoal

138
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:53,193
Let me burn some for you

139
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:00,616
Burn or not, that's not important

140
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:04,897
Even if it warms the body, it can't warm the heart

141
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:12,431
young mistress returned.

142
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:25,057
didn't you want to see the flowers in the yard?

143
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:26,854
why come back so early?

144
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,874
looking at the flowers for too makes me feel dizzy

145
00:11:29,738 --> 00:11:33,063
Dear 4th was kind to have plum blossoms planted in the courtyard

146
00:11:33,063 --> 00:11:35,361
But when it snows, they're all the same color

147
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,554
now all the white flowers and the snow are blended together

148
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:38,936
That's easy

149
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:41,665
if you like the red ones,

150
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:45,467
I'll let the servants,

151
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:46,761
bring them all to your palace.

152
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,459
Didn't you want me to concentrate on writing?

153
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:53,782
How come now you are throwing off my concentration by talking about these things?

154
00:11:53,782 --> 00:11:55,535
Shameless

155
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:57,644
You're the one who's not concentrating, but you blame others

156
00:11:58,254 --> 00:12:00,944
If I hadn't just lost three rounds of chess to you,

157
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,900
I wouldn't be enduring this punishment right now.

158
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,314
Dear 4th's words carry weight

159
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,469
You can't go back on your word

160
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:09,613
Alright

161
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:11,883
Huan Huan is also

162
00:12:11,883 --> 00:12:13,618
making a coat for Dear 4th as a gift.

163
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:18,358
It's fine if I go back on my words.

164
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:21,816
Simply because you thought of personally making a coat for me,

165
00:12:21,816 --> 00:12:24,878
I would copy three times and not mind.

166
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,288
Dear 4th said it yourself!

167
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,959
To copy all the song lyrics about plum blossoms for Huan Huan

168
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,253
Don't renege!

169
00:12:37,635 --> 00:12:40,233
You applied clear paper onto the windows

170
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:42,224
The color of snow pours in from outside

171
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:44,155
It's even brighter than Hall of Resting Soul

172
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,952
I don't like the room to be dark

173
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:51,183
Besides, once it rains or snows, we use up a lot of candles

174
00:12:51,183 --> 00:12:54,025
Not only does the air smell, it's also too wasteful

175
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:55,574
You are quite frugal

176
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:58,954
Not to mention other expenses,

177
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:02,504
the candle expenses in the inner palace have increased considerably.

178
00:13:02,504 --> 00:13:04,291
Although it's not a huge number,

179
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:07,065
it is still an expense.

180
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:08,773
I'm stingy,

181
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:10,443
it's very kind of Your Majesty to still like me

182
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:12,670
When I see the Empress,

183
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,789
I also want to tell her this idea.

184
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:19,666
Cut costs in the inner palace wherever possible

185
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:22,864
It's almost the end of the year

186
00:13:22,864 --> 00:13:24,943
If some money could be saved to create a rice factory

187
00:13:24,943 --> 00:13:27,351
and give aid to the people, it would be good charity.

188
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:29,896
Then I'll tell the Empress to do it

189
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:35,998
Auspicious greetings to young mistress Chun

190
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:36,689
Where's Wan Jiejie?

191
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:37,673
Inside

192
00:13:38,748 --> 00:13:40,256
Young mistress, the Emperor is also inside

193
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:40,856
Young mistress!

194
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:46,211
Wan Jiejie!

195
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:47,423
Chun'er is here?

196
00:13:47,423 --> 00:13:48,530
Auspicious greetings, Your Majesty

197
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:50,148
Jiejie, look

198
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:52,344
Aren't the plum blossoms Chun'er picked for you pretty?

199
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:53,204
Yes they're pretty

200
00:13:53,204 --> 00:13:54,963
It's so warm here

201
00:13:54,963 --> 00:13:56,164
It's freezing outside

202
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:57,424
Quickly sit by the fire

203
00:13:58,122 --> 00:13:59,048
Your Majesty look

204
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:01,670
Are these plum blossoms I picked for Jiejie pretty?

205
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,393
Your sister was just talking about plum blossoms

206
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:04,864
and you came.

207
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:07,671
Of course, I know Jiejie the best

208
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:11,038
Lingering Chun seems to have grown much taller

209
00:14:11,038 --> 00:14:12,077
Your Majesty, did you forget?

210
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:14,439
After this year end, I will be 17

211
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:16,480
Don't just talk

212
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,807
Quickly dust off the snow on you

213
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:20,469
If you catch a cold, don't cry when you have to take medicine!

214
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:22,942
Still carrying it

215
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:24,227
Have it put in a vase

216
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:25,079
Jinxi

217
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,122
Jiejie, don't you have a white porcelain vase?

218
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:30,024
That would be best for the red plum blossoms

219
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:32,489
You picked some good plum blossoms

220
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:33,836
They're still buds

221
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:35,301
and will bloom for a while.

222
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:37,148
I just love that color

223
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:38,363
Makes the heart warm inside

224
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:41,835
I did this for Jiejie

225
00:14:41,835 --> 00:14:43,277
What will you reward me with?

226
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:46,226
I don't have much else

227
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:48,472
Try some cakes the kitchen just made

228
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,229
Great! Nothing would be better.

229
00:14:51,277 --> 00:14:52,790
Thanks to you,

230
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:55,554
I also get to eat something.

231
00:14:55,554 --> 00:15:00,157
If you didn't come, your sister would starve me

232
00:15:00,157 --> 00:15:01,427
My sister wouldn't!

233
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,686
My sister loves Your Majesty the most

234
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:06,778
If sister means to starve your majesty

235
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:08,432
it must be your majesty was staring at sister

236
00:15:08,432 --> 00:15:10,008
and has no time to eat

237
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:13,581
Listen, what a sharp tongue. She must have learned that from you.

238
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:16,117
Keep eating. Even eating can't stop you from talking.

239
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,994
Today, I'm not the emperor

240
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:24,421
I will just pretend I'm the young master of a common noble family

241
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,892
Can't I be a little talkative?

242
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,357
I dare not order Your Majesty around

243
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:31,436
but I dare order a common young master around.

244
00:15:32,494 --> 00:15:34,191
If you don't finish copying these verses,

245
00:15:34,722 --> 00:15:36,464
don't think about dinner tonight!

246
00:15:37,825 --> 00:15:40,542
Listen, isn't your sister overbearing?

247
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:43,741
She's my sister! Of course I don't think she's overbearing!

248
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:48,766
You grind the ink. If you don't, I won't write.

249
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:07,523
Originally I couldn't figure out

250
00:16:07,523 --> 00:16:11,006
why the two of you together looked so familiar to me.

251
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:12,434
My own sister

252
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:14,754
and brother-in-law back home are also this way.

253
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:16,703
One grinds the ink, the other writes

254
00:16:16,703 --> 00:16:17,926
You ate too much

255
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:19,372
Quickly, drink some water to wash it down

256
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:21,494
Why won't you let her finish?

257
00:16:22,892 --> 00:16:24,346
Keep talking

258
00:16:24,346 --> 00:16:26,407
Your majesty just likes listening to the nonsenses

259
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:29,827
Before, when my sister and brother-in-law were together,

260
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:32,038
they were very close despite not saying much.

261
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:34,873
My mother calls this...

262
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:36,663
calls this...

263
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:39,841
she calls it the joy of the lady's chamber!

264
00:16:41,131 --> 00:16:43,798
Chun'er is still young, where did you hear such things?

265
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:45,305
It's nonsense

266
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,693
And Your Majesty indulges her!

267
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:50,632
Your Majesty, do you think I'm speaking nonsense?

268
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:52,222
Of course not

269
00:16:52,222 --> 00:16:54,604
What you said was excellent

270
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,593
Huan Huan and I are like that

271
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:07,684
Young mistress

272
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:10,053
Later we will be entering the Hall of Resting Soul

273
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:12,106
By all means, don't be afraid

274
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:17,319
Servant has waited on so many young mistresses

275
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,015
It's the first time I've seen one as giggly as you

276
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,744
Slowly, slowly

277
00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:30,947
I saw at Precious Smile's place

278
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:32,944
that she used translucent paper on the windows.

279
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:36,161
That can save a lot of lighting expenses in the palace

280
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:38,122
What does Empress think?

281
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,490
The winters in Jing City are slow and long

282
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,622
Precious Smile's idea is very effective

283
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:45,624
The New Year's festival is coming, there will be many expenditures

284
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,607
Of course it would be good if money can be saved

285
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:51,340
I always thought that her intelligence and talent

286
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,870
were limited to books and poetry.

287
00:17:53,277 --> 00:17:55,915
to my surprise, she is also good at managing household

288
00:17:56,427 --> 00:17:58,430
I underestimated her

289
00:17:59,181 --> 00:18:00,982
Precious Smile is a quick learner

290
00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:03,354
She picks things up quickly

291
00:18:03,354 --> 00:18:07,209
Even more precious is her kind heart

292
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:11,038
She wanted to use the savings to establish a rice factory

293
00:18:11,535 --> 00:18:14,283
someday, she will be a great lady

294
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:20,615
I heard that last night, Your Majesty called for Lingering Chun

295
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:29,130
You checked the records in the House of Respectful Affairs?

296
00:18:30,566 --> 00:18:33,756
Lingering Chun has been in the palace for two years now?

297
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:35,915
She's a big girl now

298
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,231
I remember that she liked to eat sweets

299
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:41,528
and wear brightly colored clothes.

300
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,244
So this morning, I had some sent over

301
00:18:45,895 --> 00:18:48,881
She has a little girl's disposition, so she likes those things

302
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:52,043
It is good for a little girl to love those things

303
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:54,809
but now she's a concubine

304
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:57,427
She should act more dignified and composed

305
00:18:58,196 --> 00:19:00,697
I like her cute and straightforward personality

306
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:06,166
Unlike some people who are constantly provoking others. They irritate me.

307
00:19:10,622 --> 00:19:13,719
Reporting to Your Majesty, Sir Zhang Tingyu is here

308
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:16,064
Tell him to wait a moment

309
00:19:16,064 --> 00:19:17,093
Yes

310
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:20,695
I should be leaving as well

311
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:29,443
Is everything alright with Nian Genyao in the city?

312
00:19:30,063 --> 00:19:32,833
He has many visitors, he's very busy entertaining guests

313
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:37,244
That's normal. He has many old friends in the city.

314
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,742
Your Majesty, forgive me for being direct

315
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:43,036
Most of his visitors are people who work for him

316
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:46,107
He doesn't even look at other officials

317
00:19:47,351 --> 00:19:48,479
Go ahead

318
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,777
This time he come to Beijing

319
00:19:50,777 --> 00:19:54,090
On the way, he let the navarch Fan Shijie

320
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,296
and the governor Lee Weijun kneel to send him off

321
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:00,067
on his arrival, his troops are fulled of momentum

322
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:02,074
officials must kneel to welcome him

323
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:05,476
Nian Gengyao continued riding past them without taking a single look

324
00:20:05,476 --> 00:20:08,644
He's so arrogant, it's shocking

325
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:09,840
This really happened?

326
00:20:10,318 --> 00:20:12,329
I would not lie

327
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:16,487
Nian Gengyao returns in triumph and glory

328
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:23,031
It's easy to get carried away with pride. I will remind him.

329
00:20:23,031 --> 00:20:27,417
With Your Majesty's words, I can rest assured

330
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:29,981
The Board of Revenue has many things to attend to

331
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:32,385
Nian Gengyao understands the frontier situation

332
00:20:32,385 --> 00:20:35,463
If there's anything, you can discuss it with him

333
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:37,561
remember, just discuss

334
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:41,586
If Nian Gengyao's people are not faithful to their duties,

335
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:44,320
instead using it as an excuse to start trouble and abuse their power,

336
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,193
immediately report it to me.

337
00:20:46,193 --> 00:20:48,491
They will be harshly punished. I will absolutely not tolerate it.

338
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:52,262
It will be year end in a couple days

339
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:57,324
Is the palace's annual bonus out?

340
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,049
Yes it is

341
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:02,162
But the Internal Affairs Authority said

342
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:04,184
that the emperor wants to cut costs.

343
00:21:04,184 --> 00:21:07,130
So this year's bonus money is only half of last year's

344
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,844
Every New Years, I grant large sums of money

345
00:21:11,345 --> 00:21:15,459
Even twice the original isn't enough, and they want to cut half?

346
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:17,064
That's a drop in the bucket

347
00:21:17,064 --> 00:21:19,539
Exactly, this year is different

348
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,386
Great general is celebrating New Years in the city

349
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:24,359
We should grant the servants more money

350
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,592
Getting people in the palace to obey you

351
00:21:26,592 --> 00:21:28,441
prestige is a matter

352
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:30,205
The emperor's favor is a separate matter

353
00:21:30,848 --> 00:21:34,403
It's most important to keep giving out rewards

354
00:21:34,403 --> 00:21:36,760
so others are willing to dependably work for you.

355
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Actually Niang Niang can ask general for money

356
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:42,055
All these years brother was away,

357
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:44,191
he has been financially supporting me both openly and secretly.

358
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,347
Otherwise, these meager monthly salaries

359
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,770
wouldn't last me 10 days!

360
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:50,555
But to keep asking family for money

361
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:52,459
is not a solution.

362
00:21:53,699 --> 00:21:56,348
Actually, it's not difficult for you to make some money

363
00:21:57,944 --> 00:21:59,389
You got ideas?

364
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:01,089
I heard that

365
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:02,386
After General came back

366
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:04,775
so many people want to meet him and ask for an official position

367
00:22:04,775 --> 00:22:07,134
but General has no time for them

368
00:22:07,134 --> 00:22:09,296
so they all got into a flap

369
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:11,091
and don't know what to do

370
00:22:11,091 --> 00:22:15,084
If Niangniang is willing to recommend them to General

371
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,381
they will know how to repay niangniang

372
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,456
This is too good to be true

373
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:23,710
His majesty organised the national exam to select talented person

374
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,826
Those people introduce themself to General for the sake of their own future

375
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:28,329
If there are talented persons

376
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:30,590
and let General recommand to his majesty

377
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,908
it will be Niangniang's credit

378
00:22:33,423 --> 00:22:35,873
His majesty doesn't allowe us to interfere the national affairs

379
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,749
They want to meet my brother

380
00:22:39,895 --> 00:22:41,533
I am able to pass on a message

381
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:46,403
as to whether they will be used, it's all up to brother

382
00:22:47,954 --> 00:22:49,328
Niangniang is wise

383
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,375
Young mistress, you have been sewing this pajamas and then clearing backward for many times

384
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,913
when can you finish it

385
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:01,619
I make it for his majesty, I have to be very meticulous

386
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,904
Young mistress, you caught a cold the day before

387
00:23:08,904 --> 00:23:10,291
and then keep coughing all the time

388
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,296
How long hasn't his majesty been here

389
00:23:14,296 --> 00:23:15,634
over a month

390
00:23:16,117 --> 00:23:17,895
if not with Princess of Glory

391
00:23:17,895 --> 00:23:19,328
then his majesty must be with Precious Smile

392
00:23:19,895 --> 00:23:21,647
Princess of Glory is riding high now

393
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:23,347
I can't compete with her

394
00:23:23,895 --> 00:23:28,127
Right, but since his majesty has visited Precious Smile

395
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:30,356
young mistress gets along well with Precious Smile

396
00:23:30,356 --> 00:23:33,019
she should have reminded his majesty to come here

397
00:23:33,493 --> 00:23:35,321
His majesty hasn't came

398
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:37,142
Jiejie may not mention him

399
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:40,779
I heard that his majesty has slept with Lingering Chun recently

400
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:43,474
but she is as noisy as usual

401
00:23:43,474 --> 00:23:44,649
after having been favoured

402
00:23:45,813 --> 00:23:47,309
His majesty may not mean to favour her

403
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:49,272
probably, it is Empress' idea

404
00:23:49,647 --> 00:23:51,958
Empress is good

405
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:55,580
everyone is under her consideration

406
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,480
but Princess of Glory always bullies you

407
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,218
Empress can't help us though she want

408
00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:06,647
young mistress, you'd better go to bed early

409
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:08,956
servant will go to send for a doctor tomorrow morning

410
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:11,081
you may leave

411
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:12,387
Yes

412
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:14,112
Oh, right

413
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,714
you needn't tidy my bed today

414
00:24:17,393 --> 00:24:18,620
Yes

415
00:24:35,729 --> 00:24:37,296
Princess of Glory

416
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:47,083
Go to die

417
00:24:50,338 --> 00:24:52,749
Respects to Empress

418
00:24:53,281 --> 00:24:54,577
Get up and sit

419
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,012
Thank Niangniang

420
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:01,197
In such cold and windy days

421
00:25:01,197 --> 00:25:04,055
it's very hard of you to come and greet me so early

422
00:25:04,756 --> 00:25:06,996
I wanted to come with sister An

423
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:09,596
but she's still weak and can't be in a draught

424
00:25:09,596 --> 00:25:11,245
so I came with Lingering Chun

425
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:13,618
Lingering Chun is becoming more and more beautiful

426
00:25:13,618 --> 00:25:15,102
Is his majesty good to you?

427
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:16,499
His majesty is very nice to me

428
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:17,596
he ordered the Imperial Kitchen

429
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:19,808
to make plenty of tasty dessert for me everyday

430
00:25:19,808 --> 00:25:21,286
That's good

431
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:24,270
You are his majesty's concubine now

432
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,606
you should concern about his majesty all the time

433
00:25:26,606 --> 00:25:27,493
understand?

434
00:25:27,856 --> 00:25:28,906
Empress

435
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:31,904
I have a little request

436
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,615
hope you can grant

437
00:25:34,696 --> 00:25:35,787
say it

438
00:25:36,655 --> 00:25:38,711
I want to live with sister Smile

439
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:41,525
I moved out to get away from her illness before

440
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:43,661
but sister has already recovered

441
00:25:43,661 --> 00:25:45,281
I want to be with sister

442
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,223
There is only me live in Palace of Shattered Jade, so it's a little deserted

443
00:25:52,628 --> 00:25:54,516
If Lingering Chun accompanies me

444
00:25:54,516 --> 00:25:56,061
I will be very happy

445
00:25:56,954 --> 00:25:58,981
It is good for you to move there

446
00:25:59,952 --> 00:26:03,878
If everyone gets along well with each other just like you two

447
00:26:03,878 --> 00:26:05,821
then I will be relieved

448
00:26:08,988 --> 00:26:10,305
She is moving out?

449
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:12,526
These are Lingering Chun's things, who dare to break them

450
00:26:12,526 --> 00:26:14,814
Lingering Chun is young

451
00:26:14,814 --> 00:26:16,218
but smart

452
00:26:16,218 --> 00:26:19,182
how long does it take her to learn to to be a social climber

453
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:21,842
Lingering Chun is not such a person

454
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:23,258
she just likes lively place

455
00:26:23,258 --> 00:26:25,498
and wants to change a place to live<br>I like lively place too

456
00:26:25,498 --> 00:26:27,245
and also want to change a place to live

457
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:28,588
Is it possible

458
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,058
she planed it well, relying on his majesty's favour

459
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:34,392
asked Empress, and move out herself

460
00:26:34,777 --> 00:26:37,404
Palace of Shattered Jade is small and remote

461
00:26:37,404 --> 00:26:39,443
Sister's place is the the best

462
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:43,149
Everyone knows they are the most favoured two except for Princess of Glory at the moment

463
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:45,620
now they live together, it's more convenient for them to invite his majesty

464
00:26:46,704 --> 00:26:49,537
You and Lingering Chun came into the palace at the same time

465
00:26:49,537 --> 00:26:51,927
and you were recommended by Precious Smile

466
00:26:51,927 --> 00:26:55,304
This time, she only invited Lingering Chun to live with her, without you

467
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,537
you don't even think why

468
00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:05,924
Sister An

469
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,175
It's so cold,why are you standing here

470
00:27:10,189 --> 00:27:12,390
It's noisy outside, so I come out and have a look

471
00:27:12,975 --> 00:27:15,443
Right, it is nice here

472
00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:17,146
it's also close to Palace of Shattered Jade

473
00:27:17,146 --> 00:27:18,887
why go through all the troubles to move?

474
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,897
Sister Wan and I both love to be lively

475
00:27:20,897 --> 00:27:22,075
so we get along much better!

476
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:25,448
Yes, you both came from similar background

477
00:27:25,448 --> 00:27:26,872
you get along much bettter

478
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:30,831
Sister, you're not well, go back inside

479
00:27:33,488 --> 00:27:34,633
Go back to your business

480
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:35,706
Yes

481
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,431
Young mistress, the Empress is here

482
00:27:53,477 --> 00:27:54,867
Bring Niang Niang in quickly

483
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:06,163
Greetings to the Empress

484
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:09,677
Rise

485
00:28:09,677 --> 00:28:10,746
Thank you Niang Niang

486
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:14,476
I heard you are coughing these two days

487
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:17,912
I just visited Princess of Modesty

488
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:19,524
so I came to see you too

489
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:22,020
I just have a cold

490
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,704
and coughing a bit

491
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:25,039
Thank Niang Niang for the trouble

492
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,171
You're so young, you need to take care of your body

493
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:30,375
You musn't end up like Princess of Modesty

494
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,203
My heart will ache for you

495
00:28:34,064 --> 00:28:35,163
Jian Qiu

496
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:36,306
Young mistress,

497
00:28:36,306 --> 00:28:38,753
this is the donkey-hide gelatin sent by the Governor of Shandong

498
00:28:39,354 --> 00:28:41,013
Niang Niang didn't want to use it

499
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:42,887
and specifically asked me to save it for Young mistress

500
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:45,260
Many thanks to Niang Niang

501
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:51,944
This house is cold in the winter and hot in the summer,

502
00:28:51,944 --> 00:28:54,530
luckily the charcoals can warm you, so it's fine.

503
00:28:55,198 --> 00:28:57,069
I remember when you first came to the inner palace,

504
00:28:57,386 --> 00:29:00,816
Princess of Glory assigned the residents and took care of things

505
00:29:00,816 --> 00:29:02,428
It's inevitable there be some faults

506
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,682
Don't take it to heart

507
00:29:04,682 --> 00:29:06,048
I have the concern of Niang Niang,

508
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:07,959
I dare not ask for anything more

509
00:29:08,524 --> 00:29:09,957
I am perfectly satisfied

510
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,209
Look at you, you're the most modest and polite

511
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,419
I like you from the bottom of my heart

512
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,123
I also ache for you

513
00:29:17,544 --> 00:29:21,048
I'm afraid you will sidestep everything and suffer losses

514
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:25,137
If I have Niang Niang's concern, I will not suffer losses

515
00:29:25,747 --> 00:29:27,156
You still say you won't suffer losses

516
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:29,657
look at how cold your hands are

517
00:29:29,657 --> 00:29:31,086
Here, lie down

518
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,835
What is this?

519
00:29:40,835 --> 00:29:41,956
Niang Niang!

520
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:48,966
Leave, don't say anything reckless

521
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:49,906
Yes

522
00:30:01,874 --> 00:30:03,332
This jade pendant,

523
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:09,219
I remember Princess of Glory gave this to you

524
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:10,800
and Precious Smile

525
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,878
Each of you has one

526
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:17,041
You used this jade pendant to form a curse

527
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:19,356
Are you cursing Princess of Glory

528
00:30:19,356 --> 00:30:21,005
or cursing Precious Smile?

529
00:30:23,202 --> 00:30:24,850
Niang Niang,

530
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,017
Sister Wan is like a sister to me

531
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,994
I will rather die than curse Sister Wan!

532
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,251
It's Princess of Glory then?

533
00:30:32,454 --> 00:30:35,205
You dare to curse Princess of Glory, how many lives do you think you have?

534
00:30:35,205 --> 00:30:36,352
Why?

535
00:30:36,658 --> 00:30:40,881
Niang Niang, Princess of Glory humiliates me

536
00:30:41,474 --> 00:30:44,411
and treats me like a servant, I really...

537
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:45,585
Ridiculous!

538
00:30:46,868 --> 00:30:49,372
I thought you were smart and perceptive

539
00:30:49,372 --> 00:30:51,287
I never knew you could be so stupid

540
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:54,186
How dare you cast a curse in the palace?

541
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,982
I was ignorant, please forgive me

542
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:59,807
You're not just ignorant but also impossibly stupid

543
00:30:59,807 --> 00:31:01,295
If Princess of Glory saw this,

544
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:02,898
do you still want to live?

545
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:08,124
These curses rely on the spirits

546
00:31:08,124 --> 00:31:11,307
but your luck and life is only in your hands

547
00:31:11,307 --> 00:31:13,687
If curses really worked,

548
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:16,597
no one will need to use their brain to think!

549
00:31:17,313 --> 00:31:18,853
I was stupid

550
00:31:21,527 --> 00:31:24,842
I don't care how much you hate Princess of Glory

551
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:26,534
I just want to tell you

552
00:31:27,273 --> 00:31:29,482
instead of wasting your time on curses

553
00:31:29,482 --> 00:31:33,332
you should spend you time on the Emperor <br><br> it's half the work, twice the effect

554
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:35,593
I was wrong

555
00:31:38,793 --> 00:31:40,162
You stupid girl

556
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:46,274
Burn it. I didn't see anything

557
00:31:46,274 --> 00:31:49,189
I am grateful to Niang Niang

558
00:31:50,816 --> 00:31:53,882
You're alone in the palace, it's inevitable to feel desolate

559
00:31:56,356 --> 00:31:58,819
Even if you have a sister like Precious Smile

560
00:31:59,356 --> 00:32:01,058
but she is deep in the Emperor's favor

561
00:32:01,058 --> 00:32:03,533
I'm afraid she can't think about you all the time

562
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:05,086
If you have any more grievance in the future

563
00:32:05,086 --> 00:32:06,536
tell it to me

564
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:10,835
You musn't have stupid thoughts again

565
00:32:10,835 --> 00:32:12,491
Niang Niang's concern for me

566
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,980
I will bring it to heart and never forget

567
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,788
Good, get up. It's cold on the floor

568
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:27,868
Luckily someone told me about this

569
00:32:27,868 --> 00:32:29,648
I'll never have known otherwise

570
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:31,197
May I be bold

571
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:34,547
and ask Niang Niang who it was

572
00:32:35,124 --> 00:32:37,548
Of course it was your close sister

573
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:39,994
but she didn't mean to

574
00:32:39,994 --> 00:32:41,413
She had no choice

575
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:44,439
I told her already

576
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:47,828
this incident

577
00:32:47,828 --> 00:32:49,552
ends with me

578
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:50,941
Was it Sister Wan?

579
00:32:50,941 --> 00:32:52,764
Don't ask anymore

580
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:56,445
Just take care of your body and everything else will be fine

581
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:00,964
I respectful send Niang Niang off

582
00:33:16,464 --> 00:33:18,292
Young mistress, it's time for your medicine

583
00:33:23,574 --> 00:33:24,853
Young mistress?

584
00:33:30,463 --> 00:33:31,443
Young mistress!

585
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,515
How dare you bite the hand that feeds you!

586
00:33:33,515 --> 00:33:35,598
I don't know what I did wrong

587
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,698
but please punish me!

588
00:33:38,457 --> 00:33:40,575
But I dare not

589
00:33:40,575 --> 00:33:42,747
bite the hand that feeds me

590
00:33:42,747 --> 00:33:45,137
You're always the one who cleans my chamber

591
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:47,737
you know exactly what is in my palace

592
00:33:47,737 --> 00:33:49,798
How dare you say you don't know?

593
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:51,580
Young mistress, please calm down

594
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,210
I do clean young mistress' chamber

595
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,511
but recently you won't let me touch your bed

596
00:33:57,511 --> 00:33:59,526
I don't know if something went missing or what

597
00:33:59,526 --> 00:34:01,119
but I really don't know!

598
00:34:01,816 --> 00:34:05,286
Then again, I'm not the only one who's allowed in this chamber

599
00:34:05,286 --> 00:34:06,867
There's also Ju Qing

600
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:08,664
If something really went missing

601
00:34:08,664 --> 00:34:10,935
I'm not the only suspect!

602
00:34:10,935 --> 00:34:12,226
Ju Qing

603
00:34:12,226 --> 00:34:13,537
Yes

604
00:34:13,537 --> 00:34:17,309
Few days ago, young mistress said it's cold and wanted a thicker blanket

605
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,328
It was Ju Qing who did it

606
00:34:21,451 --> 00:34:23,782
Luckily I remembered your order

607
00:34:23,782 --> 00:34:25,521
and told her to just leave it there

608
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,337
No one is allowed to touch young mistress's bed

609
00:34:28,337 --> 00:34:30,315
Yes,

610
00:34:31,798 --> 00:34:33,366
there's also Ju Qing

611
00:34:34,793 --> 00:34:38,398
She was originally Sister's servant

612
00:34:40,623 --> 00:34:43,698
Bao Juan, get up quickly, let me see your injury

613
00:34:43,698 --> 00:34:45,060
I dare not

614
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,319
It's all my fault, I was too harsh

615
00:34:50,094 --> 00:34:53,563
But Bao Juan, you are my trusted aide

616
00:34:53,563 --> 00:34:55,268
that's why I was so harsh

617
00:34:56,183 --> 00:35:00,820
I was afraid you were the one who disclosed my information to others

618
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,221
Young mistress, I wouldn't dare

619
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,598
I hoped it wasn't you

620
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:12,811
but I never thought it would be Ju Qing

621
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:16,011
Young mistress, you suspect Ju Qing?

622
00:35:16,011 --> 00:35:18,129
She was originally Sister's servant

623
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:21,740
Aside from her, there's no one else

624
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:27,178
I thought Sister was doing me a favor

625
00:35:27,178 --> 00:35:29,098
by sending her to serve me

626
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:34,678
I never thought she wanted to plant a mole

627
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,893
right under my eye

628
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:43,434
I remember Internal Affairs Authority

629
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,095
sent over two otter fur garments

630
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:47,655
Remember to give them to Pin of Respects

631
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:49,058
one for her

632
00:35:49,058 --> 00:35:51,962
and ask her to secretly give the other to Sister Mei

633
00:35:51,962 --> 00:35:52,884
I know

634
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:56,033
I originally thought with Pin of Respects as the supervisor

635
00:35:56,033 --> 00:35:57,853
I could still go see Sister Mei sometimes

636
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,895
But with Princess of Glory watching so closely

637
00:35:59,895 --> 00:36:01,552
there's no loophole at all

638
00:36:02,755 --> 00:36:04,028
Young mistress, don't worry

639
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,066
Wait until the year passes and spring comes

640
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:08,136
find a time when His Majesty is happy

641
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:10,033
and try to persuade him to release Mistress Mei

642
00:36:11,578 --> 00:36:13,457
Also remember to urge them back home,

643
00:36:13,457 --> 00:36:14,894
they must catch Liu Ben

644
00:36:14,894 --> 00:36:16,197
Yes

645
00:36:16,197 --> 00:36:17,295
Young mistress, let's hurry

646
00:36:17,295 --> 00:36:18,808
I heard the Empress Dowager will be there too

647
00:36:18,808 --> 00:36:20,492
even the 17th prince is back

648
00:36:20,492 --> 00:36:22,255
It will be bad if we're late

649
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:23,384
Let's go

650
00:36:24,053 --> 00:36:26,845
This time I went to the old plank roads of Jiange County and Zitong County,

651
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:28,310
Li Bing's Dujiangyan,

652
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,379
and Du Fu's residence in Huanhua

653
00:36:31,384 --> 00:36:33,363
Did you see the Thousand Buddha Rock?

654
00:36:33,363 --> 00:36:35,465
I know Imperial Mother care about the Buddhas,

655
00:36:35,465 --> 00:36:37,323
so I prayed to each of them for Imperial Mother

656
00:36:38,191 --> 00:36:40,109
You have quite the filial piety

657
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:43,733
The Shu Road is harder to climb than the sky

658
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:45,524
This has been a difficult trip

659
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:51,524
Princess of Glory, this is a nice outfit

660
00:36:51,945 --> 00:36:53,890
Although I have bad eyesights,

661
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:56,676
it still dazzles my eyes

662
00:36:59,187 --> 00:37:00,903
Empress Dowager gave me that hair ornament

663
00:37:00,903 --> 00:37:04,297
and I thought I should have some nice clothes <br><br> to compliment it

664
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:07,662
So I had the Embroidery House made me some

665
00:37:07,662 --> 00:37:10,194
The clothes must match the accessories

666
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:13,537
the silk flowers you wear

667
00:37:13,537 --> 00:37:15,518
must have costed a fortune too

668
00:37:15,518 --> 00:37:18,768
The silk flowers given in the palace are all made of satin

669
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:21,627
They are pretty but also rot easily

670
00:37:21,627 --> 00:37:24,341
The ones I use are embroided with gold threads

671
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:27,063
and connected with gemstone beads

672
00:37:27,063 --> 00:37:30,830
They are pretty, but they must cost a lot too?

673
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:34,630
Thank Empress for the concern,

674
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,063
but I have subsidies from home

675
00:37:37,063 --> 00:37:38,801
I don't have to waste the palace's money

676
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:44,189
It'll be nice if we all had a family like Princess of Glory

677
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:46,211
then we won't have to wait on the monthly allowances

678
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:47,937
and live so stingily

679
00:37:50,176 --> 00:37:52,144
Even if I have a good family

680
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,613
it's because of His Majesty's appreciation

681
00:37:54,613 --> 00:37:56,729
Nian Genyao only has one sister

682
00:37:56,729 --> 00:37:58,897
of course he subsidizes you with

683
00:37:58,897 --> 00:38:00,436
everything I gave him

684
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,328
Empress Dowager, it's time for your medicine

685
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:08,367
The Imperial Doctor is waiting in the palace

686
00:38:09,304 --> 00:38:10,461
Emperor,

687
00:38:10,461 --> 00:38:13,651
I don't feel well, I will leave now

688
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:15,520
Imperial Mother must take care of yourself

689
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,049
so I will not worry

690
00:38:23,631 --> 00:38:25,992
Respectfully sends Empress Dowager off

691
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:32,256
This is the wine made by Precious Smile

692
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:33,720
everyone have a taste

693
00:38:34,476 --> 00:38:36,284
This is osmanthus flower wine

694
00:38:38,878 --> 00:38:41,105
Precious Smile and I picked the freshely opened osmanthus

695
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:44,437
from this autumn to make this wine

696
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:47,196
That's why Imperial Brother is so pleased

697
00:38:47,196 --> 00:38:48,902
and wanted us to treat it

698
00:38:49,696 --> 00:38:52,924
In a family feast, with all the princes,

699
00:38:52,924 --> 00:38:56,289
the osmanthus wine is sweet but also slightly meager

700
00:38:57,098 --> 00:38:59,797
If we treat the guests with fine wines from the palace

701
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:01,584
wouldn't it demonstrate the style of the Imperial family better?

702
00:39:02,558 --> 00:39:04,242
The war in the northwest just ended

703
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:06,480
even the Empress Dowager and the Emperor are cutting expenses

704
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,004
of course the inner palace has to follow suit

705
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,818
Replacing the expensive wines

706
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:14,469
with the osmanthus wine personally made by the Emperor,

707
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:17,068
it not only shows the intention of cutting expenses

708
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:19,171
but also shows the closeness of the Imperial family

709
00:39:20,211 --> 00:39:23,770
It's good that Precious Smile wants to cut down expenses

710
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:27,395
but I heard <br><br> Precious has a pair of jade shoes made with Shu silk

711
00:39:27,395 --> 00:39:28,810
the luxury can not be matched

712
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:32,287
I don't know if I can see them sometimes?

713
00:39:34,146 --> 00:39:37,135
His Majesty gave them to Sister Wan because he likes her!

714
00:39:37,135 --> 00:39:39,807
Of course it should be as luxurious as possible!

715
00:39:39,807 --> 00:39:42,419
If His Majesty wants to, why not?

716
00:39:42,419 --> 00:39:43,964
Isn't that right, Your Majesty?

717
00:39:45,811 --> 00:39:49,370
You always say what's on your mind, that's the thing I like the most about you

718
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:53,781
Precious Fucha, don't you think so?

719
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:57,272
That's right, Lingering Chun

720
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:08,683
