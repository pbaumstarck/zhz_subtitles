1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,788
<i> ~ Episode 22 ~ </i>

2
00:00:03,197 --> 00:00:05,210
Niang Niang definitely got honored today

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,844
When the empress was next to Niang Niang

4
00:00:06,844 --> 00:00:08,595
she seemed so shabby compared to you

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,185
Even though the emperor said to be frugal

6
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:15,062
you can't be too uncaring about your own face and appearance

7
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:18,428
Who doesn't want the woman sitting to them

8
00:00:18,428 --> 00:00:19,744
to be eye-catching and attractive?

9
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:24,264
I was thinking that since the Empress Dowager is still sick

10
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:28,337
I should give something to show my filial heart

11
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:31,087
and gain favor from this old person

12
00:00:31,703 --> 00:00:33,001
Isn't that easy?

13
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,708
As long as silver (money) is spent

14
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,410
there will be good things

15
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,787
The people I recommended to my brother last time

16
00:00:40,787 --> 00:00:42,611
how much of the silver they gave is left?

17
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:44,442
Servant just went to see

18
00:00:44,442 --> 00:00:45,757
besides rewarding servants

19
00:00:45,757 --> 00:00:48,865
and buying jewelry and clothing

20
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:50,643
there are still four or five thousand ounces left

21
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:52,526
How is that enough?

22
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:57,046
You have to give the very best to the Empress Dowager

23
00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:58,953
or you might as well not give at all

24
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:01,575
If only at this time

25
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:04,016
I can get some silver, it would be nice

26
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:07,623
Servant heard from Zhou Ning Hai

27
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:09,626
that someone had wanted to go through Niang Niang's backdoor

28
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:11,163
for a long time

29
00:01:11,163 --> 00:01:12,471
Who?

30
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:14,471
Last month, the Chief General impeached Zhao Zhi Yuan

31
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:16,301
and he lost his job as the Zhili Governor

32
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:17,497
No way!

33
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:20,995
Gege (older brother) personally asked the Emperor to fire him

34
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:23,578
how can I let him meet Gege again?

35
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:24,719
Zhao Zhi Yuan said that

36
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,846
if he can meet the Chief General

37
00:01:26,846 --> 00:01:27,986
and say at least a sentence to him

38
00:01:27,986 --> 00:01:30,523
he would send fifty thousand ounces of silver to Yi Kun Palace

39
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,718
If he is successful

40
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:33,569
he would double the amount!

41
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:37,107
Ok then

42
00:01:37,107 --> 00:01:39,687
then tell Zhou Ning Hai to accept the silver

43
00:01:39,687 --> 00:01:42,184
and tell Gege about Zhao Zhi Yuan

44
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,499
Let me see

45
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:48,434
how much skills he has to persuade Gege

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,136
Greetings to the Chief General

47
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,754
The Emperor and Prince Guojun are inside playing Chinese chess

48
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:06,558
Then I'll be here waiting

49
00:02:06,558 --> 00:02:07,738
Yes

50
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:10,386
then I am sorry that the Chief General will have to wait here long

51
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:13,687
Can Chief General please move to the side slightly

52
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:16,562
Courtiers cannot stand at the very middle

53
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:18,296
I'll just wait here for a little bit

54
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:20,687
Ah, yes.

55
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:24,782
Go get a chair and allow Nian Chief General to sit while he waits

56
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:25,842
Yes

57
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,245
Chief General, please sit

58
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,087
Move it to the front a little

59
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:45,719
Move it closer

60
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:48,757
Chief General, please sit

61
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,597
Was your journey to Chuan Shu all good this time?

62
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:05,628
The scenery was good, but the people were cold

63
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:06,781
I (courtier brother) was heading west

64
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:08,558
especially at the Shan Gan region

65
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:12,000
the people only respected Nian Chief General and none disobeyed the law

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,222
Occassionally there are a couple who don't obey

67
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:14,877
but they were pressed down quickly

68
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:16,245
there wasn't any disagreement

69
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:29,674
Emperor Brother has won

70
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,105
I won quite dangerously

71
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:36,024
I was fighting hard for a long time

72
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:37,756
but I still lost the whole game

73
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:40,108
wouldn't have tried so hard if I had known earlier

74
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:43,394
If you victory can be achieved easily, what's the point?

75
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,062
You must strategize carefully and then you can win

76
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,150
It was fun playing

77
00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:56,099
I'm not as good at chess as Emperor Brother

78
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:01,812
Playing chess is like managing an empire, emphasizing on the art of balancing

79
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:04,873
I only know advancing/backing down, not balancing

80
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,385
No wonder I always lose to Emperor Brother

81
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:10,711
This game will end here for now

82
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,228
I'll come here next time to learn from Emperor Brother

83
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,644
Leave peacefully, Prince Guojun

84
00:04:23,684 --> 00:04:25,810
Nian Chief General

85
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,290
Courtier greets Prince Guojun

86
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,956
Courtier was in the Northwest for many years

87
00:04:29,956 --> 00:04:32,510
when it's cold my foot illness would start

88
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,216
so I can't get up to greet the Prince

89
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:37,437
I hope the Prince won't get angry at me

90
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:39,558
It's fine

91
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:41,468
as long as you don't lose your manners in front of the Emperor

92
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,200
What?

93
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,734
Prince has a good temper

94
00:04:50,734 --> 00:04:52,837
but servant's (my) heart is made of flesh

95
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:54,839
I can't stand the Prince being humiliated like this

96
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,409
This time when he, Nian Gengyao, arrived in Jing City,

97
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:58,504
all the courtiers had to kneel down to welcome him from afar

98
00:04:58,504 --> 00:05:00,540
Such power and honor is definitely a first

99
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:04,260
Besides, he and Long Ke Duo are like the Emperor's arms

100
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,356
I'm only one of the deceased Emperor's sons

101
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:07,609
not really worth much

102
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:09,489
but the Prince is still the Prince

103
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:11,320
He's just a servant

104
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:17,716
when a prince loses power, he is not on par with a servant

105
00:05:17,716 --> 00:05:20,180
when a servant gains power, he will humiliate his master

106
00:05:20,997 --> 00:05:22,339
Ever since Emperor Brother stepped onto throne

107
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:24,388
he's been suspicious about the deceased Emperor's sons

108
00:05:24,388 --> 00:05:27,059
with me, he's already nice enough

109
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:28,553
but Nian Gengyao being such a tyrant

110
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:30,535
I (servant) can't stand it!

111
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:32,421
Indifferent to self-suppression

112
00:05:32,421 --> 00:05:34,372
is the key to surviving besides the Emperor

113
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:34,810
But...

114
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,100
no need to speak further

115
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:38,879
Prince

116
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,843
Do we visit Tai Fei (royal concubine dowager) at the end of this month?

117
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:42,940
Everything's been arranged already

118
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:46,078
as usual, the Prince doesn't need to worry

119
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:48,997
I'm enduring all this for Mother

120
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:50,801
and Mother is enduring everything for me

121
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:54,180
A Jin, no need for more words

122
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,565
Yes

123
00:05:54,565 --> 00:05:56,043
Courtier has sin

124
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:59,430
Courtier didn't know the right person and almost delayed military matters

125
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,792
Please forgive me, Emperor

126
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:04,691
What? Get up and talk

127
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:05,795
Yes

128
00:06:08,153 --> 00:06:10,117
The last time Courtier reported

129
00:06:10,117 --> 00:06:13,550
that Zhili Governor Zhao Zhi Yuan was useless and unintelligent

130
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,360
was because I believed others' rumors

131
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,263
and caused Zhao Zhi Yuan to lose his job

132
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:23,030
This time Courtier has investigated Zhao Zhi Yuan again more carefully

133
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,017
and found out that he is a loyal, capable person

134
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:30,392
Zhao Zhi Yuan's job loss was caused by Courtier's words

135
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:32,588
it is Courtier's big mistake

136
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:36,252
Courtier has thought about it day and night and was anxious and ashamed

137
00:06:36,252 --> 00:06:39,222
so I've come to apologize to the Emperor

138
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,848
You were working for me

139
00:06:43,513 --> 00:06:45,356
The matter has a lot of inner details

140
00:06:45,356 --> 00:06:47,229
so it's hard to have everything done perfectly

141
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,318
Since Zhao Zhi Yuan's already been dismissed

142
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:52,657
Loyal, righteous men like Zhao Zhi Yuan

143
00:06:52,657 --> 00:06:57,129
not being used by the imperial court makes me anxious and worried

144
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,575
I've already dismissed him because of your words

145
00:07:05,101 --> 00:07:07,049
If he is used so suddenly again

146
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:10,005
the imperial order being changed so quickly

147
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:14,777
My orders in the future would not be trusted by others

148
00:07:16,514 --> 00:07:18,219
Courtier has misinvestigated

149
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:20,061
If it's because of my mistake

150
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:22,340
that the imperial court had to lose righteous courtiers

151
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,399
I would be ashamed of myself

152
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,219
Since the emperor already gave the imperial order

153
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:30,100
to dismiss Zhao Zhi Yuan from being a Zhili Governor

154
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:34,509
Then please give him some other job

155
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:36,857
it would save the Emperor's face on one hand

156
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,814
and be fair to righteous courtiers on the other hand

157
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:45,650
Are you really gonna be so insistent?

158
00:07:47,513 --> 00:07:49,811
Courtier has already made a mistake, I can't make it again

159
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:53,101
please let Courtier to correct his mistake

160
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,006
Since you've so insitently recommended him

161
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:03,213
then I'll use him again, though it's out of order

162
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:05,652
You say what kind of job he should get

163
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,344
Courtier is scared, Emperor's royal decision will be it

164
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:10,994
You understand what kind of job he should get

165
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:14,019
you should his talent

166
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:18,160
can Zhao Zhi Yuan be the Industry Political Commissioner?

167
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,281
I'll listen to you

168
00:08:22,609 --> 00:08:23,789
Thank the Emperor

169
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:32,513
You are loyal toward the Empire and puts it first

170
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:39,764
I, naturally, views you as an important courtier

171
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,091
Courtier bows to thank Emperor

172
00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:52,696
Don't know it's which master of the Harem Palace

173
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:54,360
that Courtier Nian Gengyao has seen before

174
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:57,082
Our master is Lady Wan

175
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:01,305
Lady Wan

176
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:03,037
Greetings to Nian Chief General

177
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:05,125
Thank the Lady for her fortunate words

178
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,460
Hua Fei (Fei is 3rd to highest ranked title) Niang Niang is Courtier's younger sister

179
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,919
If Niang Niang is good, then I am good

180
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:13,776
Niang Niang is favored by the Emperor

181
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:15,228
how can she not be good?

182
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:18,316
Though the Emperor favors her

183
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:21,149
I only fear that some don't know their places

184
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:25,722
and use their imperial favors to displease Niang Niang

185
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:29,937
Nobody would dare to create conflicts

186
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,554
I should hope so

187
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,131
Or else even if the Emperor doesn't interfere

188
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:36,876
I will not just let it go either

189
00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:40,356
Siblings have deep relationships, it's the norm

190
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:44,883
Since the lady understands, courtier shall go for now

191
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:52,359
What was the expression on Nian Geng Yao's face when he went out?

192
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:57,390
Chief General was happier when he went out than when he came in

193
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:01,469
How can he not be happy when the Emperor called him?

194
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:03,413
He is happy

195
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:05,095
When the Chief General arrived

196
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:07,348
Emperor was still playing chess with Seventeenth Prince

197
00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:10,684
so he waited outside for a while sitting on a chair

198
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:12,708
He was sitting while he was waiting?

199
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:13,602
Yes

200
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,357
Even when the Seventeen Prince went out, the Chief General did not get up

201
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:18,943
said he had foot illness

202
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:21,501
Fortunately Seventeen Prince's personality is good

203
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,399
so he didn't argue with him

204
00:10:24,803 --> 00:10:26,288
But now that you think abou it,

205
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:28,543
Chief General has so many achievements

206
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:30,664
who would dare to argue with him?

207
00:10:32,376 --> 00:10:33,559
Servant was wrong in his words

208
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:38,471
You said the truth, not necessarily wrong

209
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:49,166
Lady Wan is here

210
00:10:49,988 --> 00:10:52,934
Servant was just about to come get you

211
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:54,219
I don't dare to

212
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:55,398
Is the emperor inside?

213
00:10:55,398 --> 00:10:56,521
He is

214
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:58,270
Nian General was just here

215
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,842
Emperor is not very happy

216
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:01,881
Lady should be careful in dealing with him

217
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:03,102
Thanks Gong Gong

218
00:11:16,507 --> 00:11:18,043
Courtier Concubine greets the Emperor

219
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:19,883
May the Emperor receive ten thousand blessings and golden peace

220
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:20,939
Get up then

221
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:22,411
Yes

222
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:23,465
Sit

223
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:26,257
Did the Courtier Concubine arrive at the wrong time?

224
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,379
Emperor just finished discussing matters with Nian Chief General

225
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:30,860
and must feel tired

226
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:34,341
I am a little tired

227
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:40,653
Huan Huan, you are learned in poetry

228
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,362
What are your thoughts on cliques?

229
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:45,107
Courtier Concubine does not dare to interfere with political matters

230
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:46,536
No worries

231
00:11:46,536 --> 00:11:49,005
I only discuss historical works with you

232
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:52,832
Courtier Concubine has long lived in the Back Palace, so how can I know these things?

233
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:57,904
But when Courtier Concubine read Ouyang Xiu's clique theory

234
00:11:57,904 --> 00:11:59,546
there was a section that quite made sense

235
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,002
Tell me about it

236
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:04,264
Sir Ouyang said

237
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:05,506
when villains seek the same goal

238
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:07,225
acquaintances will become part of the clique

239
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:08,982
but when only one can attain that benefit and they have to fight amongst themselves

240
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:12,330
or when both parties have attained the benefit and the goal is already achieved, they will harm each other

241
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,641
To come together for benefits will result in disbandment because of the fight for benefits

242
00:12:16,641 --> 00:12:18,244
therefore any worrying matters

243
00:12:18,244 --> 00:12:20,437
shouldn't amount to be the Emperor's worries

244
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:26,550
You usually know how to say things that will make me happy

245
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,304
Just talks don't count

246
00:12:29,304 --> 00:12:32,322
You have to write Ouyang Xiu's clique theory

247
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:34,982
so that when I'm worried

248
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:36,962
I'll look at your writing and not be worried

249
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:38,304
After so much fuss

250
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:40,606
it seems like Emperor only wanted to make Courtier Concubine write

251
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:43,466
Courtier Concubine's writing most resembles a devil's writing

252
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:45,838
If the Emperor wants to look at writings

253
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:48,198
then find a famous calligrapher to write

254
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:57,062
Emperor

255
00:13:01,716 --> 00:13:04,616
A man's best calligraphy still has a rough prideful air to it

256
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:08,268
it can't compare to a woman's finely written calligraphy

257
00:13:08,268 --> 00:13:12,969
when worried it has a calming effect

258
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:18,008
Then Courtier Concubine will respectfully obey the order

259
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:19,131
Write then

260
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:27,089
Niang Niang

261
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:34,087
Niang Niang, besides the promised ten thousand ounces of silver checks

262
00:13:34,087 --> 00:13:37,554
these are all additional items Zhao Daren honored you with

263
00:13:37,554 --> 00:13:39,536
He surprisingly convinced Gege

264
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:41,271
Isn't that right, Niang Niang?

265
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:44,562
Zhao Daren has decided to follow Niang Chief General now

266
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:46,947
Chief General even personally talked to the Emperor

267
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:48,527
and got a job for Zhao Daren

268
00:13:49,374 --> 00:13:51,329
He really only said one sentence

269
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:53,632
Reply to Niang Niang, Yes

270
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,578
I am curious then

271
00:13:57,348 --> 00:13:59,541
What kind of sentence was it?

272
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,857
Servant heard that

273
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:04,404
when Zhao Daren met Niang Chief General

274
00:14:04,404 --> 00:14:05,750
he only said this one sentence

275
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,674
Three hundred thousand ounces of silver delivered to Niang Chief General's household

276
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:11,223
Ten thousand silver checks delivered to Yi Kun Palace

277
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:15,125
I'll count him as capable

278
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:30,378
Lady put a lot of thought into this nightgown

279
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:33,103
this garment really is flawless

280
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,838
If it had Lin Rong's embroideries

281
00:14:36,838 --> 00:14:39,005
the garment would be ten times better than me

282
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,000
If discussing embroideries

283
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,401
of course there will always be someone better

284
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:45,809
but if discussing thoughtfulness

285
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:48,224
this piece would be the very best

286
00:14:48,224 --> 00:14:50,212
Emperor treats me so well

287
00:14:50,212 --> 00:14:52,477
so I naturally have to serve him with my whole heart and my whole mind

288
00:14:58,205 --> 00:15:01,563
Only a few stitches are left to bring the Dragon to life

289
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:03,419
with the embroidery of the Dragon's eyes

290
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:10,005
Isn't it right? I embroidered for so many days

291
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:12,338
Lady's embroidery is so good

292
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:13,937
the best embroideress in the whole embroidery department

293
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:15,443
would not compare to Lady

294
00:15:15,443 --> 00:15:17,226
And then there's Lady's thoughtfulness

295
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:19,991
Sleeping gown is closest to the body

296
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:22,559
If Emperor really wore this sleeping gown

297
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,758
he would definitely feel Lady's affection

298
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:32,683
Emperor, Empress Niang Niang has arrived

299
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:35,587
Courtier Concubine greets the Emperor

300
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:37,414
You've came, rise then

301
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:38,866
Thanks to the Emperor

302
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:48,733
The bill of Back Palace's spendings are paid for

303
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:51,376
Courtier Concubine especially brought it for the Emperor to see

304
00:15:58,897 --> 00:16:01,670
How did Yi Kun Palace spend eight thousand this month?

305
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,711
that's more than triple the spending of Empress Palace

306
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:08,425
After one month would be the New Year

307
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,146
Hua Fei has always liked luxuries

308
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:12,059
so it's hard not to spend so much

309
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:13,573
Even in that case

310
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,386
you are the Empress, she's only a Fei

311
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:17,494
Her spendings

312
00:16:17,494 --> 00:16:20,040
shouldn't exceed that of the Empress Palace

313
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:22,935
Hua Fei cares about the face and the appearance

314
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:25,642
most of her accessories are foiled with gold

315
00:16:25,642 --> 00:16:26,935
and she ordered the Imperial Household Department clothing

316
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:29,313
to make a new batch of jewelry and clothing

317
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:31,195
add to the fact that Niang General came to Jing City this year

318
00:16:31,195 --> 00:16:33,305
Hua Fei has to give something

319
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:35,726
so her spending was a little more

320
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:37,821
Women cares for their appearance to show status

321
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:40,142
so Hua Fei is taking care of the Nian Family's

322
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:41,698
and the Imperial Family's face

323
00:16:42,925 --> 00:16:44,563
If it were for her own family

324
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:46,598
I wouldn't mind

325
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,455
From now on, report to me however much her palace spends

326
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,644
Yes

327
00:16:53,857 --> 00:16:55,024
But these silver

328
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:57,195
are only for Yi Kun Palace's daily spendings

329
00:16:57,729 --> 00:16:59,642
Courtier Concubine asked just in general

330
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:03,998
and Hua Fei's silver for awarding people exceeds this number

331
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:10,026
Niang Geng Yao must have given Hua Fei quite a lot also

332
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:12,819
A sheep's hair grows on a sheep (reap what is sown), let her

333
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:16,412
Courtier Concubine dares to ask

334
00:17:17,557 --> 00:17:21,417
if these silver came from Nian Geng Yao's household

335
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:24,512
then did the Emperor award Nian Geng Yao that much?

336
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:27,276
If it wasn't from the Emperor

337
00:17:27,276 --> 00:17:30,230
and Hua Fei spends so much in one month

338
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,828
where did these silver come from?

339
00:17:32,828 --> 00:17:37,078
I roughly know so no need to say more

340
00:17:37,078 --> 00:17:38,604
Yes

341
00:17:39,363 --> 00:17:41,659
Emperor, Cui Yu Pavilion and Yan Xi Palace

342
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:44,280
each sent in one sleeping gown. Emperor please look it over

343
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,288
Cui Yu Pavilion and Yan Xi Palace really has interlocked hearts

344
00:17:47,715 --> 00:17:49,099
how about Emperor just take a look?

345
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:50,567
Take it here

346
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:02,161
This golden dragon was embroidered so lively

347
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:05,177
just one look and you know it must be An Changzai's embroidery

348
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:08,498
In the back palace, there are none that can compare to her embroidery

349
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,059
it really is quite fine

350
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,359
Even though it's a sleeping gown

351
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,326
to be able to take care of minor details so carefully and thoughtfully

352
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:21,544
shows that An Changzai (changzai is second lowest of concubine titles) has Emperor in her heart

353
00:18:29,882 --> 00:18:31,342
Chun Er is already an adult

354
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:32,687
and yet still plays with these scented powder

355
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:35,103
begging us to see them

356
00:18:35,103 --> 00:18:36,229
How can I not show you guys?

357
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:37,934
Mo Mo always says I'm not white enough

358
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:40,424
and applies so much of these powder on me everyday

359
00:18:40,424 --> 00:18:41,714
Now that I got good ones

360
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:43,428
I have to show to Jie Jie (older sister or an older female friend)

361
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:47,420
This is Jasmine powder from Yangzhou

362
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,256
said they grinded white jasmine flower and blended it in

363
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:52,839
this powder is smooth and scented, and whiter than snow

364
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:55,432
this scented powder really is high class

365
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,437
I have a box of sunflower powder

366
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,560
it's white, but not as scented as this powder

367
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:04,399
I originally thought that applying powder everyday was troublesome enough

368
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:06,577
but now I have to apply this thing everyday

369
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:08,396
and can't even miss a spot

370
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,086
Only by applying powder often can you keep your skin white, soft, and fine

371
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:13,904
it isn't just a day's work

372
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,468
you must apply every day, every night

373
00:19:15,468 --> 00:19:18,135
to get a skin color as white as peeled boiled eggs

374
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,644
Come, I'll put it on for you. You'll guaranteed to be white and smell good!

375
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:23,294
the Emperor will like it so much!

376
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,392
I'm telling you guys

377
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:28,434
last night when I went to serve Emperor's sleep

378
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,950
I got curious

379
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,117
wondering if the Emperor's body was white or not

380
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,662
I really wanted to look

381
00:19:34,662 --> 00:19:35,782
You guys have to know

382
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:38,218
before I always closed my eyes and didn't dare to look

383
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,462
This girl, always telling lies

384
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:42,132
Jie Jie, don't stop her

385
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:44,227
Let her say it, let her say it

386
00:19:44,227 --> 00:19:46,385
She's not mature and you still let her

387
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,147
I looked and looked hard

388
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:49,911
and the Emperor just looked at me and said

389
00:19:49,911 --> 00:19:52,215
"Why do you keep on staring at me today?"

390
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:55,265
is it because you liked the pattern of a golden dragon coming out of a cloud on my night gown?

391
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:56,767
If you like it

392
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:58,933
I'll tell people to cut it off and give it to you

393
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,631
And then?

394
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:02,646
And then the Emperor really did take it off

395
00:20:02,646 --> 00:20:05,357
and put on a night gown with the pattern of two dragons fighting for a pearl

396
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,155
The Emperor told me

397
00:20:07,155 --> 00:20:09,912
"Stop staring at me and sleep now"

398
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:18,001
And then the Emperor really did change his sleeping gown

399
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:20,074
Yeah, why would I lie to you about that?

400
00:20:20,074 --> 00:20:21,171
The emperor also said

401
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:23,797
he really likes the material of the Two Dragon Fighting for Pearl

402
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:27,034
and that only like this would it be comfortable

403
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:27,925
So I asked

404
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:29,965
who gave you this nightgown?

405
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,590
The Emperor smiled and said

406
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:34,004
then go ask your Wan Jie Jie

407
00:20:38,077 --> 00:20:40,215
So it was embroidered by Wan Jie Jie

408
00:20:40,215 --> 00:20:42,171
Don't tell lies, who believed you?

409
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:43,824
I didn't lie to you

410
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:45,932
I asked the Emperor, did Wan Jie Jie make this?

411
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:47,344
Emperor (you) really seem to like it

412
00:20:47,895 --> 00:20:49,131
The Emperor then said

413
00:20:49,907 --> 00:20:52,618
"I know in my heart what kind of person makes what kind of clothes"

414
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,141
And then I laughed

415
00:20:54,141 --> 00:20:55,235
I asked the Emperor

416
00:20:55,235 --> 00:20:56,636
"Then was that Golden Dragon Coming Out of a Cloud

417
00:20:56,636 --> 00:20:59,516
too modest so the Emperor didn't like it?"

418
00:20:59,516 --> 00:21:01,499
"It must be made by Embroideresses from the Embroidery Department"

419
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:02,501
Don't say those things

420
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:03,731
Though the Emperor likes you,

421
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:05,543
you can't always be so blunt and careless when you talk

422
00:21:06,484 --> 00:21:07,815
I only thought that

423
00:21:07,815 --> 00:21:10,101
just one lonely dragon twined on a cloud

424
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:11,313
doesn't have much use

425
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,085
Why doesn't it get a friend?

426
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:14,951
Ok ok, don't talk about it anymore.

427
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:16,819
You don't even have limits and manners.

428
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:19,958
I told the kitchen to make plum flower cake

429
00:21:21,158 --> 00:21:22,980
you go see if it's done yet

430
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,239
If it's ready, take it here for your An Jie Jie to try some

431
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:25,636
Ok sure!

432
00:21:25,636 --> 00:21:27,344
Jin Xi, go with her

433
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:28,211
Let's go

434
00:21:30,243 --> 00:21:32,042
The Imperial Doctor came here today

435
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:35,406
and said that my liver and intestines are not good so I should avoid pastries

436
00:21:36,688 --> 00:21:38,586
It's almost time for me to take my medicine

437
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:40,371
so I'll leave now

438
00:21:40,371 --> 00:21:42,548
alright, be careful on your way back

439
00:22:10,251 --> 00:22:11,614
Lady what happened?

440
00:22:11,614 --> 00:22:13,927
why did you start crying when you are fine?

441
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:18,639
Get out

442
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,820
Lady misses her family and can't suppress her sadness

443
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,371
Don't take it to the heart, go out and serve

444
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:28,486
Yes

445
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,061
Did Chun Er go back?

446
00:22:40,634 --> 00:22:42,330
She took two bags of pastries with her

447
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,182
and looked very happy

448
00:22:44,182 --> 00:22:47,305
Chun Er is innocent so she's always happy

449
00:22:47,305 --> 00:22:48,955
Among Lady's sisters

450
00:22:48,955 --> 00:22:51,292
Shen Daying (lowest of concubine rank) is kind and easygoing

451
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:53,180
Lady Chun is innocent

452
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:56,107
Lady An is thoughtful in everything

453
00:22:56,796 --> 00:22:58,648
It's because she is so thoughtful and sensitive

454
00:22:58,648 --> 00:22:59,949
that sometimes

455
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:01,997
I don't dare to say some things in front of her

456
00:23:02,391 --> 00:23:05,502
Like today, Chun Er was carelessly speaking

457
00:23:05,502 --> 00:23:07,670
I fear that Lin Rong will worry more now

458
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,546
Among these ladies

459
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:14,096
only Chun Changzai is the least crafty and has a pure heart

460
00:23:14,682 --> 00:23:17,867
It's because she's so innocent that makes me worry

461
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:19,717
Sometimes she offends others and doesn't even know

462
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:24,664
Then Lady will just have to care for Lady Chun more

463
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:27,302
and help her at times

464
00:23:27,728 --> 00:23:29,295
This He Tian jade pin

465
00:23:29,295 --> 00:23:32,820
has a durable fine quality and is a rare find

466
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,884
Later go to Yan Xi Palace and give it to Lin Rong

467
00:23:34,884 --> 00:23:35,765
But

468
00:23:35,765 --> 00:23:38,044
Servant remembered that this jade pin

469
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:40,645
was personally given to the Lady by the Emperor

470
00:23:43,831 --> 00:23:45,591
Just to comfort An Changzai

471
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,545
Lady really put in a lot of efforts

472
00:23:48,537 --> 00:23:50,426
There are few sincere sisters in the Palace

473
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:51,952
I can't let her be sad

474
00:23:53,944 --> 00:23:56,520
Then servant will take care

475
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,490
to deliver this jade pin to An Changzai

476
00:23:59,436 --> 00:24:02,758
Lady's heart will surely be understood by An Changzai

477
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:06,339
Then, servant will go now

478
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:07,465
Go then

479
00:24:19,888 --> 00:24:21,698
Fortunes to Lady

480
00:24:21,698 --> 00:24:24,259
Aunty, why did you come here now?

481
00:24:24,915 --> 00:24:26,744
Lady Wan got a new pair of jade pins

482
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,331
since among the sisters of the palace

483
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:31,189
she is best friends with Lady

484
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:33,427
she especially ordered me to deliver this to Lady

485
00:24:33,427 --> 00:24:34,805
Thanks to my sister

486
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:37,509
Whenever she gets good stuff she always thinks of me

487
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,953
Our Lady said

488
00:24:38,953 --> 00:24:41,294
back in the Jin Household, whenever there are some pretty accessories

489
00:24:41,294 --> 00:24:43,110
it's always two people taking turns wearing it

490
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,116
Now in the palace, we should all the more share our fortunes

491
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:48,406
Bao Juan, help keep it safe for me

492
00:24:48,406 --> 00:24:48,984
Yes

493
00:24:48,984 --> 00:24:50,563
I am so happy right now

494
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,523
Please give my thanks to Jie Jie

495
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:57,604
Oh and, today I heard Jie Jie cough once

496
00:24:57,604 --> 00:24:59,064
Please when you return,

497
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,583
boil a pack of sugar loquat leaf

498
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:04,330
Thanks Lady for caring

499
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,024
Servant shall do it accordingly

500
00:25:07,497 --> 00:25:10,586
Servant has another word of advice to give to to Lady

501
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,222
Chun Changzai is young and innocent

502
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:15,415
If she said anything inappropriate

503
00:25:15,415 --> 00:25:18,185
please tolerate her, Lady An

504
00:25:19,906 --> 00:25:22,698
Of course, we are all sisters

505
00:25:22,698 --> 00:25:24,447
what is there to not tolerate?

506
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:27,775
Besides, Chun Er's personality

507
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:29,213
it's not like I don't know it

508
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:33,288
Lady's tolerance really is Chun Changzai's fortune

509
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:36,324
Then, servant shall leave now

510
00:25:36,324 --> 00:25:37,908
Please wait

511
00:25:37,908 --> 00:25:39,812
Bao Juan, go send out Aunty

512
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:40,806
Yes

513
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:50,656
Please leave carefully

514
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:58,387
Ju Qing?

515
00:25:59,576 --> 00:26:02,197
What are you doing standing here in such a cold day?

516
00:26:02,197 --> 00:26:03,381
Jin Xi aunty

517
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:05,938
You've been wronged?

518
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:08,780
Lady came back crying

519
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,258
I just asked her what's wrong

520
00:26:10,258 --> 00:26:12,762
and Lady broke stuff and ran me out

521
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:16,493
I've never seen Lady been so angry before

522
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:20,362
Which master doesn't take their temper out on their servant?

523
00:26:21,423 --> 00:26:23,849
Lady Lin Rong is already one of the good-tempered ones

524
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:25,908
Don't cry anymore

525
00:26:26,358 --> 00:26:30,198
If your face gets frostbites, it won't be pretty anymore

526
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:35,245
This jade becomes warm when you touch it - it's definitely rare

527
00:26:36,451 --> 00:26:39,827
But now that Lady you have it, aren't you happy?

528
00:26:41,363 --> 00:26:44,223
If I give it to you, would you be happy?

529
00:26:44,223 --> 00:26:45,694
Of course servant would be happy

530
00:26:47,224 --> 00:26:49,090
Yeah

531
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,261
when others give to you, you are of course happy

532
00:26:52,955 --> 00:26:55,304
But I'm equal to her

533
00:26:55,304 --> 00:26:56,929
we're both concubines of the Emperor

534
00:26:58,094 --> 00:27:01,427
this kind of fine stuff I've never even seen before

535
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:04,734
but she has everything

536
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:06,657
when she knows that I'm not happy

537
00:27:06,657 --> 00:27:09,932
she would give me this, give me that

538
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:12,285
Lady don't think so much

539
00:27:12,285 --> 00:27:13,896
I don't want to think so much either

540
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,928
She has good material

541
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:18,778
when she's happy she would give me two yards

542
00:27:19,397 --> 00:27:21,806
The sleeping gown she made for the emperor

543
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,636
was praised by the Emperor for its comfort

544
00:27:26,665 --> 00:27:30,479
But mine can be cut and given to others

545
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:36,965
Nowadays, even Chun Changzai dares to be in my face

546
00:27:38,317 --> 00:27:40,957
and laughs at how cheap my embroidery is

547
00:27:42,064 --> 00:27:43,780
making me lose all my face

548
00:27:45,027 --> 00:27:47,325
and even cursing to me forever alone

549
00:27:47,325 --> 00:27:50,047
Chun Changzai only gains favor because of her youth

550
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:51,910
so it's hard not to be prideful

551
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,051
Lady don't mind her

552
00:27:54,051 --> 00:27:56,357
at least Lady Wan cares for you

553
00:27:56,357 --> 00:27:59,313
or else why would she give you this jade pin?

554
00:27:59,313 --> 00:28:01,203
How is this for me?

555
00:28:01,861 --> 00:28:04,395
She's only worried that I would be angry at Chun Changzai

556
00:28:04,873 --> 00:28:06,580
so she gave me this jade pin

557
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:10,026
Chun Changzai said

558
00:28:10,026 --> 00:28:11,752
their families are around the same status,

559
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:13,839
so they're closer

560
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:16,737
What am I?

561
00:28:18,817 --> 00:28:22,345
Lady Wan is only protecting Chun Changzai

562
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:24,593
so she gave me this

563
00:28:25,846 --> 00:28:27,522
otherwise

564
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:29,023
when did she,

565
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,234
under normal circumstances, gave me such expensive stuff?

566
00:28:32,234 --> 00:28:34,455
According to you, then,

567
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:37,083
Lady Wan only cares about Chun Changzai?

568
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:39,534
but of course

569
00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:41,702
when Shen Daying was favored

570
00:28:41,702 --> 00:28:44,138
Lady Wan didn't care about us either

571
00:28:45,227 --> 00:28:47,044
I finally understand

572
00:28:48,088 --> 00:28:50,205
If Shen Daying didn't lose power

573
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:52,779
why would she have helped me?

574
00:28:53,352 --> 00:28:55,290
Now that she has Chun Changzai

575
00:28:56,106 --> 00:28:59,746
she doesn't need me anymore

576
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:02,927
If Lady is angry

577
00:29:02,927 --> 00:29:05,488
I'll put this jade pin away

578
00:29:05,488 --> 00:29:07,639
to spare Lady the anguish

579
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:09,279
since she's given me such good stuff

580
00:29:11,538 --> 00:29:13,148
I'll wear it

581
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:15,986
Or else,

582
00:29:16,466 --> 00:29:17,882
it really would be a waste

583
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:23,785
Oh right, you saw Jin Xi and Ju Qing talk

584
00:29:23,785 --> 00:29:25,689
They were very close to each other

585
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:27,866
Now I know

586
00:29:28,784 --> 00:29:30,529
If it wasn't for her (Ju Qing) secret messages

587
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:33,441
how could Lady Wan have so coincidentally,

588
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,994
like me,

589
00:29:35,994 --> 00:29:39,859
made a night gown and given it to the emperor, trying to fight with me for favor?

590
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:43,309
from now on, Lady will have to more cautious around Ju Qing

591
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:55,550
Why is Emperor wearing this old sleeping gown today?

592
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,487
Didn't Lady Wan and An Changzai a few days before

593
00:29:57,487 --> 00:30:00,321
made new sleeping gowns for Emperor?

594
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,074
Undergarments that are worn longer are still the best

595
00:30:06,189 --> 00:30:09,032
Comfortable, durable

596
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:14,477
This nightgown was made by Empress Chun Yuan when she was still here

597
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:20,376
At that time, she made many clothes for me

598
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,220
There are only two garments left

599
00:30:24,224 --> 00:30:27,862
Jie Jie's sewing skills are among the best

600
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:31,193
It's late now, let's sleep

601
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,185
Alright

602
00:30:34,185 --> 00:30:37,863
Tomorrow Hua Fei has a date with the Six Palaces to watch an opera at the Qing Yin Pavilion

603
00:30:45,585 --> 00:30:48,373
Empress Niang Niang arrives

604
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:52,646
Hua Fei Niang Niang arrives

605
00:30:56,717 --> 00:30:59,983
To Empress Niang Niang be ten thousand fortunes and golden peace

606
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,137
To Hua Fei Niang Niang be ten thousand peace

607
00:31:03,137 --> 00:31:05,015
All rise

608
00:31:05,015 --> 00:31:07,140
Thanks be to Empress Niang Niang

609
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,146
What kind fo operas are prepared today?

610
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:21,709
Reply to Empress Niang Niang's words:

611
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:24,847
It's Nanfu Opera's Liu Jinding to the Rescue

612
00:31:24,847 --> 00:31:29,013
The rest are what each Lady has selected

613
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:30,505
Let them start then

614
00:31:31,044 --> 00:31:33,503
I and the Empress shall select first

615
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:34,526
Yes

616
00:31:41,953 --> 00:31:43,952
Niang Niang please select first

617
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:51,509
I remember there was a well-performed version of Ding Zhi Chun Qiu

618
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,431
which talked about the Three Kingdoms

619
00:31:54,968 --> 00:31:56,763
What does Empress think of it?

620
00:31:57,804 --> 00:32:00,666
Since you want to watch it, then select first

621
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:02,704
Jie Jie

622
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:05,092
Hua Fei Niang Niang is ahead of Empress Niang Niang?

623
00:32:05,894 --> 00:32:08,269
This opera is fun, you will like it

624
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:22,711
Then Courtier Concubine will also select Xue Dingshan Conquer the West

625
00:32:23,477 --> 00:32:26,271
Hua Fei Niang Niang's older brother has made quite a few accomplishments in war

626
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:28,598
just like the General Xue Dingshan of the Tang Dynasty

627
00:32:28,598 --> 00:32:31,747
who succeeded in conquering the west and left his name in history

628
00:32:31,747 --> 00:32:34,325
Lady Cao really knows how to talk

629
00:32:34,325 --> 00:32:35,706
Niang Niang select now

630
00:32:36,878 --> 00:32:39,501
I only like Advising Jin Ke

631
00:32:39,712 --> 00:32:42,068
just select another Yao Tai would be fine

632
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:45,550
Niang Niang has a good heart and does good deeds

633
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,714
just like the kind mother Yao Tai, who brought fortune to the world

634
00:32:49,265 --> 00:32:51,998
Advising Jin Ke talks about Mu Lian saving mother

635
00:32:52,395 --> 00:32:55,976
just like how Third Ah-ge (Emperor's son) has a filial heart towards you

636
00:32:56,489 --> 00:33:00,331
I remember that the golden hand-warmer in Qi Fei's hand

637
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:02,540
was given by Third Ah-ge

638
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,353
Hua Fei has a good memory

639
00:33:05,562 --> 00:33:07,963
Third Ah-ge has too much of a filial heart

640
00:33:08,264 --> 00:33:11,053
if he spent more time on reading and studying

641
00:33:11,053 --> 00:33:13,039
Emperor would not lose his temper as much

642
00:33:21,848 --> 00:33:24,903
Mei Mei (younger sister)'s clothing today is really pretty

643
00:33:25,614 --> 00:33:27,745
Gold and ruby jewelries

644
00:33:27,745 --> 00:33:30,226
make you look luxurious and generous

645
00:33:30,226 --> 00:33:32,066
it catces one's eyes

646
00:33:33,822 --> 00:33:38,017
I fear that since Jiang Zhongmin hasn't managed Imperial Household Dept. for a long time, he won't make good stuff

647
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,427
so I especially asked Gege

648
00:33:39,427 --> 00:33:41,930
to get me jewelry from outside the Palace

649
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,904
Few days ago I looked it over

650
00:33:43,904 --> 00:33:46,368
The golden threads are still not bound together tightly enough

651
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:49,247
said it was ten and something masters that made it

652
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:51,829
but it was only a bit better than Imperial Household Dept.'s

653
00:33:52,887 --> 00:33:54,363
so I decided to just wear it

654
00:33:54,363 --> 00:33:57,778
Such luxuries must have cost much

655
00:33:57,778 --> 00:33:59,576
In reality, if the stuff is good

656
00:33:59,796 --> 00:34:01,655
what does silver or money matter?

657
00:34:02,556 --> 00:34:04,993
Empress Niang Niang is way too calculating

658
00:34:05,926 --> 00:34:09,004
Since the family and business is big, I can't but not ask

659
00:34:13,914 --> 00:34:16,931
In reality, if it can show Mei Mei's beauty and air

660
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:19,108
Silver and money really doesn't matter

661
00:34:20,347 --> 00:34:22,390
Courtier Concubine is very glad to hear

662
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,257
such words from the Empress

663
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:28,251
I heard that a few days ago Empress tattled on me

664
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:30,640
for my large spendings

665
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,732
Actually even if my spendings are big,

666
00:34:32,732 --> 00:34:36,599
Empress Niang Niang doesn't need to feel such pain

667
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,190
It's Courtier Concubine's own business

668
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,633
it doesn't matter how much I exceed the monthly limit

669
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:44,023
I'll tell my family to make up for it exactly

670
00:34:47,856 --> 00:34:50,768
I'm also very glad that

671
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:52,433
Mei Mei has the heart to care for me

672
00:34:53,238 --> 00:34:55,473
I hope that with Hua Fei as an example

673
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:58,970
all the sisters can understand that every stitch every thread doesn't come easily

674
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,585
if you can't make it open source, then at least be conservative about it

675
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:12,400
Thanks Empress Niang Niang for her instructions, Courtier Niang Niang accepts them

676
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,044
Alright, get up now

677
00:35:14,044 --> 00:35:15,963
Thanks Empress Niang Niang

678
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,847
Talking about Xue Dingshan Conquering the West,

679
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:29,333
you cannot but also mention Fan Lihua

680
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:31,261
Look at this Fan Lihua

681
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:33,834
always finding ways to make her husband like her

682
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:36,088
but her husband only likes other people

683
00:35:36,611 --> 00:35:38,367
and divorced Fan Lihua three times

684
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,846
If I were Fan Lihua

685
00:35:41,314 --> 00:35:43,482
I would rather go down from my position and leave

686
00:35:43,482 --> 00:35:46,364
than see my husband with his body here and his heart somewhere else

687
00:35:48,006 --> 00:35:50,926
If you are the wife, you must have tolerance

688
00:35:51,356 --> 00:35:53,873
Doesn't matter how much the husband loves the concubines

689
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:56,749
The wife is the wife

690
00:35:56,749 --> 00:36:00,494
Even if Xue Dingshan divorced Fan Lihua three times

691
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:02,888
didn't he also have to beg Fan Lihua three times to return to him?

692
00:36:04,654 --> 00:36:06,997
At least that Fan Lihua came from a good family

693
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:10,716
she is the daughter of the wife of a Xiliang General

694
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:16,346
If it were the daughter of a concubine,

695
00:36:16,346 --> 00:36:19,254
she wouldn't have this kind of ability

696
00:36:19,254 --> 00:36:21,242
and death would be her only path

697
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,921
Don't you think it's right, Niang Niang?

698
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,514
Empress Niang Niang

699
00:36:40,423 --> 00:36:42,900
Can we select a Nan Ke Opera?

700
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,797
Jie Jie

701
00:36:43,797 --> 00:36:46,125
your opera in the end turned out to be just a dream

702
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,755
that's no fun

703
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:50,499
Watching operas are not for fun, but for warning people

704
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:54,466
You see Nanke's rise and you also see his fall

705
00:36:54,466 --> 00:36:57,515
the higher you climb, the harder you'll fall

706
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,554
in the end his riches are gone, who would still care about wife vs concubine and high-class vs low-class?

707
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:02,243
and money and power?

708
00:37:02,243 --> 00:37:04,097
it was just Nanke's Dream

709
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:10,775
Though we all watch the same opera, Lady Wan gets more out of it

710
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:13,786
no wonder the emperor likes to talk to you so much

711
00:37:13,786 --> 00:37:15,899
Courtier Concubine only discusses the matter as it is

712
00:37:18,051 --> 00:37:21,078
Courtier Concubine also thinks that waiting for the clouds to part to see the moon

713
00:37:21,078 --> 00:37:24,162
the most important part is both hearts are willing

714
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:27,345
An Changzai is also a royal concubine

715
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,323
how can you say words like "two willing hearts" in the public

716
00:37:29,323 --> 00:37:32,527
without shame and embarrasment?

717
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:34,440
Having a thick face

718
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,771
is a rare ability

719
00:37:40,356 --> 00:37:42,357
In the opera script for Peony Pavilion

720
00:37:42,357 --> 00:37:44,714
Feelings, don't know from where do they arise, that they become such devoted feelings.

721
00:37:44,714 --> 00:37:47,396
The live one can die, the dead one can live

722
00:37:47,727 --> 00:37:50,839
An Mei Mei was only discussing the opera as it was

723
00:37:53,576 --> 00:37:55,632
Lady Wan is very educated in literary works

724
00:37:55,632 --> 00:37:58,214
Even opera script she can recite from nowhere

725
00:37:58,214 --> 00:38:01,713
If she was only discussing opera, then let's just watch the opera

726
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:20,916
Today is the eighth day of the twelveth lunar month

727
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:23,121
the Back Palace all has to go greet the Empress Dowager

728
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:24,966
Lady should also prepare something

729
00:38:26,996 --> 00:38:29,355
The fur on this garment is very fine

730
00:38:29,355 --> 00:38:30,881
shiny as oil, smooth as water

731
00:38:32,147 --> 00:38:34,864
people in the Imperial Household Dept. is careful in their work

732
00:38:34,864 --> 00:38:36,262
they know that Lady is scared of the cold

733
00:38:36,262 --> 00:38:37,801
so they picked high quality fur

734
00:38:37,801 --> 00:38:39,660
to help Lady guard against the cold

735
00:38:41,074 --> 00:38:43,064
See, these few days the snow has stopped

736
00:38:43,064 --> 00:38:44,585
those were the coldest days

737
00:38:45,683 --> 00:38:48,222
Lady, this fur coat has a bright color

738
00:38:48,222 --> 00:38:49,630
it's pretty and warm

739
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,822
the Imperial Household Dept. especially gifted it to honor Lady

740
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,657
Do you think it's fitting?

741
00:39:07,634 --> 00:39:09,657
When meeting the Empress Dowager

742
00:39:09,657 --> 00:39:11,843
there's no need to wear clothes that especially stand out

743
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:14,781
gentle and modest like this is most appropriate

744
00:39:27,276 --> 00:39:31,884
Empress Dowager gives order to meet royal concubines of the Back Palace

745
00:39:41,071 --> 00:39:42,321
Lady Wan

746
00:39:42,321 --> 00:39:43,622
Lady Fucha

747
00:39:43,622 --> 00:39:44,688
Lady Cao

748
00:39:44,688 --> 00:39:46,562
give greetings to the Empress Dowager

749
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:56,072
We wish the Empress Dowager's phoenix body to be healthy and have fortunes for ten thousand years

750
00:39:56,072 --> 00:39:58,632
I haven't seen Lady Wan for a while

751
00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:00,912
Raise your head and let me see your face

752
00:40:03,595 --> 00:40:07,933
