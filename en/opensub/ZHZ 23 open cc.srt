00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
<i> ~ Episode 23 ~</i>

2
00:00:03,317 --> 00:00:06,803
We wish the Empress Dowager health and fortunes for ten thousand years

3
00:00:07,638 --> 00:00:09,884
I haven't seen Lady Wan in a while

4
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,940
Raise your head and let me see your face

5
00:00:16,843 --> 00:00:18,818
Get up now

6
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,178
Thanks Empress Dowager

7
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:25,025
Lady Wan is very sensible

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,170
and her personality is easygoing

9
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,928
Courtier Concubine Zhen Huan bows to the Empress Dowager

10
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:36,028
Empress Dowager please accept my formal bow

11
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:37,510
Courtier Concubine is delighted beside myself

12
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:42,180
Very good. Really are quite sensible.

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,751
Courtier Concubine was young and rash

14
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:45,703
it's all thanks to Empress Dowager's grace and protection

15
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:48,235
Empress and all the Jie Jie (older sisters) are also willing to teach me

16
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:49,872
so that I don't lose my manners

17
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:53,410
I don't blame the Emperor for liking you, I also like you

18
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,937
Zhuxi

19
00:00:55,937 --> 00:00:56,418
Yes

20
00:00:56,418 --> 00:00:59,405
Get two rolls of cloud brocade and grant them to Lady Wan

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,923
Thanks Empress Dowager

22
00:01:02,768 --> 00:01:04,176
Can you write?

23
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:07,908
Lady Wan has a nice personality and is literate

24
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:10,725
Courtier Concubine is somewhat learned in literary works, but my calligraphy is messy

25
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:12,356
I fear that it's not fit for the Empress Dowager's eyes

26
00:01:13,485 --> 00:01:15,381
it's good you can write

27
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:18,439
Come to the Palace of Age and Health often to be my company

28
00:01:19,172 --> 00:01:22,168
Copy verses for me, ok?

29
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:24,293
As long as Empress Dowager doesn't mind my clumsiness

30
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,508
Courtier Concubine will serve the Empress Dowager with all my heart

31
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:36,610
Having you come here everyday to copy verses

32
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,086
really take up your free time

33
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,759
To be able to copy verses for the Empress Dowager

34
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,472
is my fortune

35
00:01:49,882 --> 00:01:53,771
The snow is falling so hard that even branches are broken off under the weight

36
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:58,657
You are a child with a quiet heart

37
00:01:58,657 --> 00:02:02,480
I see that you don't talk much

38
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,204
My heart was originally not calm

39
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:06,306
but after copying verses for the Empress Dowager,

40
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:07,973
my heart has slowly becomes quiet and calm

41
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:10,851
Therefore to have a calm and peaceful spirit

42
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:13,264
is to copy the true words of Buddha

43
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:16,951
Are you done copying?

44
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:18,368
Almost done.

45
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:38,710
Does Empress Dowager also like sandalwood?

46
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,089
Followers of Buddha mostly use sandalwood scent

47
00:02:43,446 --> 00:02:47,357
The harem rarely uses this scent, how did you recognize it?

48
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,135
Courtier Concubine sometimes uses it for calming the heart

49
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,715
it works better than Peace Scent

50
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:54,382
That's right, life often has moments where it doesn't go your way

51
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,154
It's good you learn how to get rid of that discontentment

52
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:03,191
Didn't I say that I would come?

53
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:05,079
Why are you asleep so early then?

54
00:03:05,994 --> 00:03:08,272
Maybe because in Mother's palace

55
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,047
I got tired from copying the verses

56
00:03:11,447 --> 00:03:13,063
Then you are quite weak

57
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:17,957
But I did wait for the Emperor for a long time

58
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:20,055
I fear the cold and I was sleepy

59
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:22,467
I was dictating some proposals and time passed by quicker than I thought

60
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:23,913
It's my fault

61
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,733
The weather is cold and the snowfall is heavy.

62
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:28,064
Courtier Concubine thought that Emperor would go to the closer palace

63
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:30,245
to Empress Niang Niang's palace for tonight

64
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:32,623
I just visited the Palace of Peace and Righteousness a few days back

65
00:03:32,623 --> 00:03:33,969
and you are telling me to go again?

66
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:37,648
The days are cold and matters for the New Year are plentiful

67
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:40,564
Empress Niang Niang's body may not be strong

68
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,012
Emperor should go there often to accompany her

69
00:03:44,195 --> 00:03:45,953
Yesterday when Courtier Concubine visited her palace

70
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:48,600
I saw Empress Niang Niang drew a picture of samuume

71
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,757
Emperor did you see

72
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:51,172
No I didn't.

73
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:54,740
I'll have lunch with Empress tomorrow then.

74
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,983
and look at the picture there.

75
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:58,404
Emperor only eats lunch there

76
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,490
and Empress Niang Niang puts her whole heart into preparing it.

77
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:03,687
You should go eat dinner there.

78
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,699
That way you can also rest at the palace

79
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:07,189
My Huan Huan is certainly very generous

80
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:11,692
Empress Niang Niang is the mother of the whole empire

81
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:14,365
Emperor should go be with her more

82
00:04:14,365 --> 00:04:16,087
Since you are so moral, I'll go there tomorrow

83
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:25,629
Greetings to Empress Niang Niang. To Niang Niang be ten thousand fortunes and golden peace.

84
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:26,940
Rise and grant her seat.

85
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,302
Thanks Empress Niang Niang

86
00:04:29,774 --> 00:04:32,500
What's with you guys today? It's like it's planned

87
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,211
The arrival times are all pretty similar.

88
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:36,403
Today really is a coinicidence.

89
00:04:36,403 --> 00:04:38,292
These few days are cold

90
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:41,472
Is your body better?

91
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:44,272
It's better. Thanks for Jie Jie's caring

92
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:50,369
I've made a joke of myself

93
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:52,201
It's only the cold

94
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:54,575
I don't know why it's been dragging on for so long

95
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:59,030
Did you guys hear that? Just a cold

96
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,638
has caused An Changzai's voice to worsen

97
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:02,999
it's not like before

98
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:04,832
Wan Jie Jie only cares for An Jie Jie

99
00:05:04,832 --> 00:05:07,125
and ignores me. I'm also your Mei Mei

100
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,973
Yes. Of course you are my Mei Mei

101
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:11,847
Everyone here are all sisters

102
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:15,942
Wan Jie Jie, look at me, I got fatter today.

103
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,474
These newly made clothes are already tight at the sleeves

104
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:22,192
Well yes. Breakfast is two bowls of rice porridge and three sugar buns.

105
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:23,842
Lunch is fat chicken and fat duck

106
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:25,742
Before dinner you also eat snacks

107
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,205
If it weren't for me stopping her at dinner

108
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:29,025
that whole bowl of ham stew

109
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:30,995
would have been in your stomach

110
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:32,398
And even then she still complains about her hunger

111
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:35,026
so then she eats a midnight snack, but she's still hungry!

112
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:36,068
Your stomach

113
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:38,088
will probably become more and more round as you eat

114
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,101
Jie Jie likes to make fun of me more now

115
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:41,740
But Jie Jie is right

116
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,482
I can't eat like this anymore

117
00:05:43,482 --> 00:05:45,088
Even Emperor said that my clothes

118
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:46,613
have to be remade every two months

119
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,543
I either grew taller or grew fatter

120
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:52,307
But I envy An Jie Jie

121
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:53,775
and how she can remain so slender

122
00:05:54,802 --> 00:05:56,709
It's fine if you are a little fat

123
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,905
as long as Emperor likes it

124
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:00,945
Your An Jie Jie probably envies you too

125
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:02,718
being able to eat so much

126
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:06,949
Look at how skinny you are, it's not good

127
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,425
You have to eat medicine.

128
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:10,545
but you also have to balance it.

129
00:06:13,368 --> 00:06:15,747
Thanks for Niang Niang's care

130
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:18,909
I don't have as much as fortune as Chun Mei Mei

131
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:23,575
Being able to eat is fortunate, being remembered by others is also fortunate

132
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:25,820
Just look at your Wan Jie Jie

133
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,026
and even how much you eat everyday

134
00:06:28,644 --> 00:06:30,208
she's noted in her heart

135
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:36,051
Alright. Sit down now.

136
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,061
Yes

137
00:06:41,716 --> 00:06:43,949
Lady Fucha, are you ok?

138
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:45,784
Did you eat unsanitized food during breakfast

139
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:46,788
that caused your body to be unwell?

140
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:49,212
Reply to Empress Niang Niang:

141
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:51,985
It's not that Lady ate bad food; she's pregnant

142
00:06:51,985 --> 00:06:53,384
Don't lie

143
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:55,899
Is that true?

144
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:59,136
That's great! It's an event worth celebrating!

145
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:01,221
We have to congratulate the Emperor

146
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,865
Really? Did the Imperial Doctor inspect it?

147
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:07,186
Two imperial doctors have already inspected

148
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:10,677
I'm not the type to do anything just to gain favor from the Emperor

149
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:12,872
If I have it, then I do. If I don't, then I don't.

150
00:07:12,872 --> 00:07:14,712
How I can falsify things about imperial descendants?

151
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,949
Isn't it enough to have Shen Daying as an example?

152
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:20,228
Lady Wan, don't you agree?

153
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,703
Fucha Jie Jie is really fortunate

154
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:27,848
Just three to five days and she's already pregnant

155
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,339
I remember that the Emperor

156
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:31,299
hasn't visited Lady Fucha for a while

157
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:34,404
He only orders you to serve him once every few months

158
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:35,837
and Mei Mei still gets pregnant

159
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:37,306
Mei Mei really is a fortunate person

160
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:40,323
Of course, this is fortune sent by heaven

161
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:42,413
It might even be a little ah-ge (or prince)

162
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:45,865
Xin Changzai, do you agree?

163
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,933
The heaven destines whether you'll get a boy or girl

164
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:51,106
The fortune of bearing a son

165
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:53,004
is not possessed by just anyone

166
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:55,734
Ok ok, it doesn't matter whether you have a son or daughter

167
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:58,024
Lady Fucha, now that you finally bear the dragon's seed

168
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:00,014
you need to take care of your body

169
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:02,358
there can definitely be no mishaps in this matter

170
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,039
Thanks Empress Niang Niang

171
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,157
Lady Wan

172
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:17,370
I am foolish as an older sister

173
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,766
I have something to ask Lady Wan

174
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,714
Please ask, Jie Jie

175
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:24,153
I really feel regretful for Mei Mei

176
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:26,252
The Emperor favors and loves Mei Mei the best

177
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:28,718
The number of times Mei Mei served the Emperor would, of course, be the most

178
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:32,609
How come you are still not pregnant?

179
00:08:32,609 --> 00:08:34,493
Now that Lady Fucha is pregnant

180
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,174
The emperor would look after her more

181
00:08:37,596 --> 00:08:39,069
Mei Mei you get free time now

182
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:41,147
so take the chance to recharge your body

183
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,040
Lady Fucha bears the dragon's seed

184
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,115
so of course the Emperor would look after her more

185
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:49,033
When Mei Mei (I) have free time, I will condition my own body

186
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:53,082
Jie Jie should also take care of your body and Princess Wenyi's

187
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:54,819
The Princess's body is worth a thousand gold

188
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:56,415
there can definitely be no mishaps

189
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,808
Yes, Lady Wan

190
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:07,177
Lady Cao's words offended Niang Niang

191
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:09,082
I'll ask for forgiveness on Jie Jie's behalf

192
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,676
Niang Niang, please forgive her

193
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:13,056
What is it?

194
00:09:14,283 --> 00:09:15,946
Lady Cao just said that

195
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:18,818
I serve the Emperor the most and yet am not pregnant

196
00:09:18,818 --> 00:09:20,986
Isn't she using these words

197
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:22,750
to insult Niang Niang?

198
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,355
Amongst the concubines, it's still Niang Niang who gets favored the most

199
00:09:26,355 --> 00:09:28,749
I shall confess Jie Jie's shortcomings for her

200
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:35,646
Does it matter whether you are pregnant or not?

201
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:36,805
Niang Niang

202
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:42,765
If the heaven cares about me, it shall grant me a son

203
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:46,495
if the heaven doesn't remember me, I shall still get a daughter

204
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:50,211
anything better than nothing

205
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:53,237
Niang Niang is right. Whether you have children or not

206
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:56,235
being favored is still favor. Even if the mother rises in stature because of a son

207
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:58,748
you still have to see if the child is liked by the Emperor

208
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:03,453
I escort Hua Fei Niang Niang

209
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,579
Lady, it's late, sleep now

210
00:10:19,937 --> 00:10:24,103
Lady Fucha got pregnant by serving the Emperor only a few times

211
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,821
but there's not even anything within me

212
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:33,082
I have to admit my fortune is shallow

213
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:37,388
How can it be so? Lady is a very fortunate person

214
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:39,804
Pregnancy will come sooner or later

215
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:42,102
Lady doesn't need to worry about it

216
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:46,642
But I heard from the city guards

217
00:10:46,642 --> 00:10:49,360
that Jing City is infested with plague

218
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,314
it's hard to say it won't spread inside the palace

219
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:54,710
Lady must be very very careful

220
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:58,649
Quickly go to sleep now

221
00:11:02,113 --> 00:11:04,024
Lady Fucha is pregnant

222
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:07,141
I've been goodhearted enough to let Songzhi send over a plate of date and yam cake

223
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:08,706
who knew that Lady Fucha would rely on her pregnancy

224
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:12,463
and not even rise to thank me. She is certainly bold!

225
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,274
Lady Fucha is only rebellious this one time

226
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,338
She doesn't really mean disrepect to Niang Niang

227
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:19,506
She just got pregnant and she's already defiant to this point

228
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,022
If she gives birth to a son

229
00:11:22,022 --> 00:11:24,482
wouldn't she think she's risen to the heavens?

230
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:28,124
That's not always true, just look at Qi Fei

231
00:11:28,124 --> 00:11:30,884
Lady Fucha is young and beautiful

232
00:11:30,884 --> 00:11:34,240
When times passes, it's hard for the Emperor not to change heart

233
00:11:35,212 --> 00:11:36,927
Yes

234
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:38,958
If she gives birth to a princess it's fine

235
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,861
but if she gives birth to a prince

236
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:43,825
it's been a while since there's been a prince born in the palace

237
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:46,306
we don't know how happy the Emperor would be

238
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,995
I remember that the Emperor only went to your place once this month

239
00:11:49,995 --> 00:11:52,865
Now that Lady Fucha is pregnant

240
00:11:52,865 --> 00:11:54,868
he probably won't even visit you once now

241
00:11:56,064 --> 00:11:57,926
I only wish that Wenyi grows up peacefully

242
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,158
I have no other desires

243
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,527
You can't tolerate people. People might not tolerate you.

244
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:07,394
Good thing that Lady Fucha isn't a fortunate person either

245
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,787
She got pregnant

246
00:12:08,787 --> 00:12:10,653
just when there's plague going around outside the palace

247
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:12,937
The Emperor is really worried right now.

248
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:16,224
Niang Niang, bad news! The plague has reached inside the palace!

249
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:18,378
What?!

250
00:12:25,497 --> 00:12:27,730
Did the mugwort get delivered to every palace of the harem?

251
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:29,629
It's already been delivered over the night

252
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:32,676
Lady Fucha is pregnant

253
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:34,388
so put more in her palace

254
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,889
Hua Fei's Yi Kun Palace got infected first

255
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:40,717
so you must clean it more

256
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:44,520
Everyday in the morning, noon, and dusk

257
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,932
burn the mugwort once to drive out the plague

258
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,671
Also, instruct the Imperial Hospital

259
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:51,990
to be ready with antidotes for the plague

260
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,858
tell the maids of every palace to make scented pounches through the night

261
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,666
and wear it on the body and hang them inside the palace

262
00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:57,930
Yes

263
00:12:58,496 --> 00:12:59,524
Imperial Doctor Zhang

264
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:00,101
Here

265
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:01,618
You are the head of the Imperial Hospital

266
00:13:01,618 --> 00:13:05,158
In your opinion, how did this plague come about?

267
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:08,109
This disease is caused by abnormal air

268
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:10,799
the first symptoms are fever and headaches

269
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,640
then, the plague clogs up

270
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,885
if one person has it, he or she can spread it to the whole room

271
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:17,555
then that one room can spread it the whole palace

272
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:21,805
We must take precuations to prevent bigger accidents from happening

273
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:23,196
It's this serious?

274
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:25,543
Courtier does not dare to exaggerate in this case

275
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:28,986
The laborers of the harem have already been infected

276
00:13:28,986 --> 00:13:31,152
the furious force of this plague can be seen

277
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:33,619
The Imperial Hospital will have to start the precautions

278
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:36,747
Empress Niang Niang, please inform each palace

279
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:38,878
not to wander around outside

280
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:42,774
Everyone only cares about their own safety now that there's news of the plague inside the palace

281
00:13:42,774 --> 00:13:45,546
The words of the Imperial Doctor should be obeyed by everyone

282
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:48,710
Everything will have to taken care of by the Imperial Hospital

283
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,478
Yes

284
00:13:51,982 --> 00:13:53,858
Report to Niang Niang: the laborer in our palace

285
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:55,075
Little Dezi got the plague

286
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:57,090
The Imperial Household Dept. is moving him out

287
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,573
What are you doing standing there?

288
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:02,853
Burn everything he's touched and all his clothes!

289
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:04,847
The cup he used, the tea set

290
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:06,298
all go break them outside

291
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:08,625
spread ashes in his room to remove the bad air

292
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,389
No need for Niang Niang to be panicking

293
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:12,336
Servant already instructed people to do it

294
00:14:12,944 --> 00:14:14,187
How can one not be panicky in a matter as big as this?

295
00:14:19,494 --> 00:14:21,367
Luck to Hua Fei Niang Niang

296
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,889
Report to Niang Niang: Empress Niang Niang said

297
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:31,903
that the plague is currently spreading around the palace quickly

298
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:33,589
and asks that Niang Niang also helps to take care of the matter

299
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:36,223
The eastern six palaces have already been spilled with boiled soju

300
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:37,646
they're currently burning mugworts

301
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:40,258
The western six palaces will be given to Niang Niang to manage

302
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:42,435
Ok

303
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:46,538
Empress Niang Niang also said that though there are not many people in Xianfu Palace

304
00:14:46,538 --> 00:14:48,538
but the Palace of Perserved Chrysanthmum where Shen Daying lives

305
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:50,316
must also start burning mugworts

306
00:14:50,316 --> 00:14:53,009
no places must be left out in the six palaces

307
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:57,473
Report back to Empress Niang Niang: I'll do it well

308
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,533
Servant will leave

309
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:08,118
Liu Ben didn't get captured

310
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:10,622
is still one of my biggest concerns

311
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:13,061
But if Shen Daying dies

312
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:14,974
even if Liu Ben is captured

313
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:16,221
it would still be a dead witness with no cross-exam

314
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:18,586
I couldn't sentence Shen Meizhuang's death in the first place

315
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:20,929
and she got away

316
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,970
Now I might as well let her die on her own

317
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:29,839
Are there any usable objects in Little Dezi's room?

318
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,099
There's still one more tea set that Little Dezi used

319
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,896
If someone wasn't careful and drank from that set

320
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:40,285
she would probably get the plague

321
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:44,785
A good object like that would be wasted if we just threw it away

322
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,100
deliver it to the Palace of Perserved Chrysanthemum

323
00:15:48,304 --> 00:15:49,358
Servant understood

324
00:15:57,607 --> 00:15:58,977
The Emperor's heart is with Lady

325
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:01,205
he specifically instructed Servant to come clean Palace of Perserved Chrysanthemum

326
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:03,464
so that Lady won't get the plague

327
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,097
If we created any disturbances, we ask Lady to please be tolerant

328
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:10,018
You guys do your thing. I'll manage on my own

329
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:11,375
what talks of disturbances?

330
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:15,317
Servant understood. Go outside and sprinkle some soju

331
00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:17,596
Come in

332
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:26,251
Lady has been imprisoned for so long

333
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,556
all the stuff here must be old

334
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:30,626
Imperial Household Affairs Dept. specificially ordered servant

335
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:32,072
to deliver you this new tea set

336
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:35,147
the tea's already been boiled. Lady please try it.

337
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:36,976
Finally got heart?

338
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:41,813
Lady, the outside's already been cleaned

339
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:43,495
If you don't have any other orders

340
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:45,302
servant has to go to other palaces

341
00:16:48,283 --> 00:16:50,121
Servant shall leave now

342
00:16:51,729 --> 00:16:52,987
The last few days you kept on coughing

343
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:54,861
you must be extra careful in taking care of your body

344
00:16:56,213 --> 00:16:57,175
Thanks for Jie Jie's care

345
00:16:58,717 --> 00:16:59,816
Thanks for Lady's care

346
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:03,505
We've already burned magworts three times a day according to given orders

347
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:07,728
The Imperial Hospital delivered some medical scented pouch

348
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:11,533
I was thinking that since your body is weak, I would give you some of mine

349
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:12,624
To protect your body

350
00:17:14,863 --> 00:17:16,595
Shattered Jade Pavillion has Jie Jie and Chun Changzai

351
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:18,776
naturally all the good stuff are there

352
00:17:19,446 --> 00:17:20,548
What are these?

353
00:17:20,812 --> 00:17:22,317
Imperial Hospital said those

354
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:23,368
are some newly delivered herbs

355
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:25,230
that would better if burned with magworts

356
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,675
They're for Palace of Everlasting Fortune

357
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:28,763
Deliver all of them to my place

358
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,542
Aren't those for our palace?

359
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:33,642
Why doesn't our Lady have the same thing?

360
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:36,541
Lady Fucha forgive my sin

361
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,891
The stuff are already going to your place

362
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,392
what will happen to our Lady?

363
00:17:39,862 --> 00:17:41,384
An Changzai's body is strong and well

364
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:42,906
she naturally doesn't need these

365
00:17:42,906 --> 00:17:44,699
I bear the Dragon's descendants

366
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:46,795
so I naturally have to be more cautious and careful

367
00:17:46,795 --> 00:17:49,067
when someday An Chanzai is pregnant

368
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,330
I would give my portion to her

369
00:17:51,942 --> 00:17:53,867
Lady Fucha and the imperial descendant's lives are lives

370
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,749
An Changzai's life is also life

371
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:58,518
Imperial Hospital will still send out more herbs

372
00:17:58,518 --> 00:18:00,846
why must Lady Fucha get it all?

373
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,182
and not care about others?

374
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:03,657
Well well who is this?

375
00:18:03,657 --> 00:18:05,949
it seems that the great Lady Wan has arrived

376
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:10,071
No wonder even An Changzai dares to fight for stuff

377
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:13,793
Jie Jie has misunderstood. Mei Mei doesn't dare to.

378
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:16,017
An Changzai has a good temper

379
00:18:16,017 --> 00:18:18,078
but I must say something

380
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,402
Today no matter what, your opinion won't count

381
00:18:20,402 --> 00:18:23,352
If you are not satisfied, why don't you go talk to the Emperor?

382
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,259
The Imperial descendant is the most important

383
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:28,004
I think the Emperor won't help you either

384
00:18:28,826 --> 00:18:30,108
Actually why disturb the Emperor?

385
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:32,867
Lady can understand this principle as well

386
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:36,466
If these herbs are only used in Lady's palace

387
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:38,895
and An Changzai gets the plague

388
00:18:38,895 --> 00:18:41,245
then wouldn't Lady be in deep trouble?

389
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:43,031
Aren't you cursing me like this?

390
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:45,488
I'm gonna go tell the Emperor

391
00:18:46,428 --> 00:18:48,547
It's Lady's choice whether to tell the Emperor or not

392
00:18:48,547 --> 00:18:51,102
I only fear that after Emperor hears about this

393
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:53,961
he will feel that Lady was shortsighted in the situation

394
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:55,920
then I won't listen to you deliberately

395
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:58,800
Move it in and close the door

396
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:05,797
Jie Jie's arguments are useless

397
00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:07,347
and you might even get in trouble

398
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:09,824
I know it's useless, but if I don't say it to her

399
00:19:09,824 --> 00:19:12,170
today she'll snatch it away once, tomorrow she'll snatch it away again

400
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,983
then An Mei Mei would have to endure her everyday

401
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:17,492
Let's go inside first

402
00:19:18,043 --> 00:19:20,632
Later, I'll get some more herbs from Imperial Hospital

403
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:21,775
How can it be that easy?

404
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:23,785
If it's that easy to get this stuff

405
00:19:23,785 --> 00:19:25,164
I wouldn't have to argue with her

406
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:28,301
Let's go

407
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:45,966
How many today?

408
00:19:46,554 --> 00:19:47,805
two have deceased this morning

409
00:19:48,574 --> 00:19:49,738
This illness comes full forced

410
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:52,261
even Imperial Hospital has no way to stop it

411
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:54,879
Empress Dowager, Empress, Qi Fei, Hua Fei

412
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:57,574
have already prayed in the Precious Glory Temple for two days

413
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:01,069
The plague is prevalent inside and outside the Jing City

414
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:04,063
Imperial Hospital's solutions are only temporary

415
00:20:04,063 --> 00:20:07,237
Emperor's been anxious for many days now. He's gotten thinner

416
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,058
The smell is too strong

417
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,233
Yeah. These few days the maids

418
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:17,237
have sprinkled vinegar everyday to drive away the plague

419
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:18,946
vinegar smell is also strong

420
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:21,716
I can get used to the smell

421
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:28,317
Lady Lady bad news!

422
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,435
Say it slowly or else you'll bump into Lady

423
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,399
Full Blessing Palace has reported

424
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,910
that Lady Mei Zhuang got the plague

425
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:38,177
Lady, you can't go!

426
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:41,267
How did this happen?

427
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:42,857
Mei Mei don't panic, sit down first

428
00:20:42,857 --> 00:20:44,176
I'll tell you slowly

429
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:48,911
It's like this

430
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:50,980
She was fine yesterday

431
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,588
but this morning when she woke up Fang Ruo reported

432
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:55,460
that she threw up everything she ate

433
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,306
she also got a high fever

434
00:20:57,306 --> 00:21:00,063
at noon she started mumbling nonesensical stuff

435
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,407
What about the imperial doctor? Did you guys get the imperial doctor?

436
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:04,102
Don't mention the imperial doctor

437
00:21:04,102 --> 00:21:06,615
Shen Daying has been grounded for a long time and have been neglected

438
00:21:06,615 --> 00:21:08,525
and now the plague is also easily contagious

439
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:09,745
which imperial doctor dares to come?

440
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:12,353
I already sent people to get the doctor three or four times

441
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,417
not even one dared to come and take a look

442
00:21:15,449 --> 00:21:17,190
Tell me, how can she get well?

443
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,861
Servant has already tried my best, I wanted to plead with the Emperor

444
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:24,004
but the Emperor is still discussing state affairs and won't see anyone

445
00:21:24,004 --> 00:21:26,430
Empress Dowager, Empress, and the several Niang Niang

446
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,910
are all in Precious Glory Temple, praying for blessings

447
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,778
there isn't anyone who can decide what to do!

448
00:21:35,189 --> 00:21:35,893
I'll go see

449
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,787
Lady you can't go, can't go

450
00:21:38,787 --> 00:21:41,632
Mei Mei, if you go into Perserved Chrysanthemum Hall you will be in danger

451
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:43,257
The plague is very contagious

452
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,659
No matter what condition, I must go see first

453
00:21:45,976 --> 00:21:46,947
Mei Mei, you can't

454
00:21:46,947 --> 00:21:49,106
Lady Lady Lady

455
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,430
Lady cares for Lady Mei Zhuang

456
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,324
but you must also take care of yourself

457
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:55,253
Yeah

458
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,763
I'll just take a peek through the door

459
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:58,763
I'll just take one look, just one look

460
00:21:58,863 --> 00:21:59,907
Lady you can't!

461
00:22:00,338 --> 00:22:01,693
Lady Mei Zhuang is already like this

462
00:22:01,693 --> 00:22:03,559
Lady must think of yourself

463
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,395
I'll just take one look

464
00:22:04,395 --> 00:22:07,186
or else Lady Mei Zhuang won't even have someone to talk to

465
00:22:07,684 --> 00:22:08,697
Lady

466
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:13,914
Lady, Lady!

467
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:19,222
Aunty, I'll have to trouble you with taking care of Mei Jie Jie

468
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:25,513
Su Gong Gong

469
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:26,843
Lady, don't take it to the heart

470
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,369
the plague is spreading among the commonfolks

471
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:31,445
Emperor is very anxious for this matter

472
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:33,247
and is currently discussing this with the courtiers and officials

473
00:22:33,247 --> 00:22:35,076
he really doesn't have time to see Lady

474
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:37,454
then how long will it be before Emperor can see me?

475
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:40,925
This matter is big. Servant doesn't dare to give an estimate

476
00:22:41,555 --> 00:22:42,758
If Lady has urgent matters

477
00:22:42,758 --> 00:22:44,359
then how about you go the Empress?

478
00:22:44,705 --> 00:22:45,824
That's the difficult part

479
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:47,790
if I plead with the Empress for this matter

480
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,738
Emperor must first give his approval

481
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:52,052
Lady is talking about Shen Daying?

482
00:22:53,437 --> 00:22:55,506
Forget it. Lady

483
00:22:55,506 --> 00:22:56,906
Servant advises Lady just one word

484
00:22:56,906 --> 00:23:00,739
Emperor is extremely worried because of the plague

485
00:23:00,739 --> 00:23:05,499
why must Lady mention Shen Daying's matter at this juncture to annoy the Emperor?

486
00:23:06,354 --> 00:23:07,744
Why not think about alternatives?

487
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:11,769
Many thanks Gong Gong. If Emperor is available

488
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:13,341
please trouble Gong Gong to report to me

489
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:14,773
Servant understands

490
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:33,885
Courtier Wen Shichu greets Lady Wan

491
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,067
Please get up, Wen Milord (lol not sure if this is exactly correct)

492
00:23:37,795 --> 00:23:38,695
Thanks Lady

493
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,158
Let's step aside and talk

494
00:23:46,704 --> 00:23:48,295
Is Wen Milord still busy with matters relating to the plague?

495
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:49,407
and has no time?

496
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:50,747
Yes

497
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,837
If I have a matter needing Milord's help

498
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:54,325
can Milord help me?

499
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:57,408
I can tell Milord

500
00:23:57,408 --> 00:23:59,398
there won't necessarily be a reward for this task

501
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:01,406
if discovered by others it might even be a felony

502
00:24:02,699 --> 00:24:03,678
but if I don't do it

503
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:05,619
my heart will probably never be at rest

504
00:24:07,036 --> 00:24:07,984
then may I ask Lady

505
00:24:07,984 --> 00:24:10,016
if courtier agrees to do it

506
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:11,911
will Lady be more assured?

507
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:16,036
If Milord is willing to help me, I would naturally be more assured

508
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:18,602
For Lady's peace

509
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:20,747
Courtier is willing to do my best

510
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,151
but all according to Lady's commands

511
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:29,397
Perserved Chrysanthemum Hall's Shen Daying is currently plagued

512
00:24:29,397 --> 00:24:30,290
and her life is endangered

513
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,310
I want to ask you to help her

514
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:37,812
But the only thing is...she's a grounded imperial concubine

515
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:42,022
No matter who she is, as long as Lady commands me

516
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,307
Courtier shall do my best

517
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,019
Will Lady be more at peace now?

518
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:48,919
Many thanks Wen Milord

519
00:24:51,192 --> 00:24:52,299
then Courtier shall go now

520
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,997
Wen Milord

521
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,680
you be careful also

522
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,124
Donkey-hide gelatin is very dollars

523
00:25:14,205 --> 00:25:15,689
Jing City's plague has caused madness

524
00:25:15,689 --> 00:25:17,313
Emperor won't even eat anything now

525
00:25:17,313 --> 00:25:19,711
You guys hurry up and find a cure

526
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:21,641
Yes, courtier understands

527
00:25:22,294 --> 00:25:23,272
Niang Niang don't be impatient

528
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,095
the cure has never been created before

529
00:25:25,095 --> 00:25:26,747
we're like blinds touching an elephant

530
00:25:26,747 --> 00:25:27,783
we must try one bit by one bit

531
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,128
what is this talk?

532
00:25:29,752 --> 00:25:31,132
I can't stand seeing the Emperor being worried

533
00:25:31,816 --> 00:25:32,852
Courtier shall do my best

534
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:36,523
"do my best, do my best" you guys already read through medical books for several days

535
00:25:36,523 --> 00:25:37,798
and still didn't find anything

536
00:25:38,425 --> 00:25:39,629
how about I do it myself?

537
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,275
Niang Niang, you've already pulled several all-nighters

538
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:43,520
If you become unwell

539
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,822
courtier can't take up the responsibility

540
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:51,374
Milord, you are still not gonna sleep?

541
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:57,657
It's about time. This cure is almost ready.

542
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,366
Milord, these fews days because of the plague

543
00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:04,568
you have been worried day and night. It really has troubled you

544
00:26:05,175 --> 00:26:06,850
Entrusted by others a righteous matter

545
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:08,904
No talks of tired or not tired

546
00:26:10,427 --> 00:26:11,288
Yeah

547
00:26:14,954 --> 00:26:17,535
Wen Milord has worked hard, why don't you go rest?

548
00:26:19,165 --> 00:26:19,984
Jiang Milord

549
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,373
These days Wen Milord

550
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,496
has to take care of the imperial concubines by days

551
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:28,092
and try to create a cure for this plague by night

552
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:30,055
you are certainly tired

553
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:32,477
any progress for the cure?

554
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:34,950
there still hasn't been a clue

555
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,095
but I'll do my best to create it

556
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:39,115
Ok then you do your thing

557
00:26:40,137 --> 00:26:41,403
Lady Meizhuang being plagued

558
00:26:41,403 --> 00:26:43,740
even the garrison guards are scared and avoid her

559
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,737
security is very loose

560
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:50,457
Servant has secretly ordered Imperial Doctor Wen to cure her

561
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,564
Are Cai Yue and Cai Xing still doing their best?

562
00:26:53,172 --> 00:26:56,303
They're very diligent, but

563
00:26:57,468 --> 00:26:59,157
Imperial Doctor Wen is curing her in secret

564
00:26:59,157 --> 00:27:01,635
medicine is lacking and food is not good

565
00:27:01,635 --> 00:27:06,314
so Lady Mei Zhuang's illness still hasn't gotten better

566
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:10,314
As for now, he must diligently treat her

567
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,644
Yes

568
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,794
Congratulations Lady, your wish has been fulfilled

569
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,746
Su Peisheng

570
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:21,944
Servant is here

571
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:23,456
Is the plague inside the palace raging?

572
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,534
Emperor, the palace laborers have died one by one

573
00:27:28,534 --> 00:27:30,441
Everywhere, people are panicking

574
00:27:31,811 --> 00:27:34,463
It's already like this inside the palace, needless to say outside the palace would be worse

575
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:37,751
Yeah. I heard that affluent individuals in the Jing City

576
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:39,217
all way to escape out of it

577
00:27:40,071 --> 00:27:41,487
But who would've thought that out of Jing City

578
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:43,815
all you see are plagued commonfolks

579
00:27:43,815 --> 00:27:45,525
so they were all scared back into the city

580
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:48,774
I heard that the Jing City is not even the worst

581
00:27:50,057 --> 00:27:51,660
The villages in Yongping are even worse

582
00:27:52,218 --> 00:27:53,978
Yeah. whenever the commonfolks there

583
00:27:53,978 --> 00:27:55,905
hear someone gets plagued

584
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:58,674
they would lock up and separate the person from the rest

585
00:27:58,674 --> 00:28:00,490
Those who were separated

586
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,842
have no other alternatives except to die

587
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:09,530
Emperor, Lady Wan outside wants to see you

588
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:11,692
How is she here when it's so late?

589
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:13,576
Could it be of some urgent matter?

590
00:28:13,903 --> 00:28:14,540
Let her in

591
00:28:14,717 --> 00:28:15,657
Yes

592
00:28:24,094 --> 00:28:25,180
Ten thousand peace to Lady

593
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:27,741
Ten thousand fortunes and golden peace to Emperor

594
00:28:29,949 --> 00:28:31,527
What happened that caused you to be come here so urgently?

595
00:28:34,585 --> 00:28:36,178
You guys can go out

596
00:28:36,787 --> 00:28:37,580
Yes

597
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,214
Say it

598
00:28:48,773 --> 00:28:49,660
Little Yunzi

599
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:57,614
Aren't you gonna lift up your head in front of the Emperor?

600
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:02,730
Courtier Liu Ben greets the Emperor

601
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:04,452
How is it you?

602
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,876
Courtier Concubine still doesn't believe

603
00:29:06,876 --> 00:29:08,861
that Shen Daying would fake her pregnancy to gain favor

604
00:29:08,861 --> 00:29:10,759
so I've secretly ordered people to investigate Liu Ben

605
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:12,416
Finally the hard work paid off

606
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,928
and we found him at the border of Yongzhou

607
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,015
Fu Lin has already been hit to deaeth

608
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:18,222
Liu Ben was responsible for anchoring the fetus many times

609
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:21,165
he knows the inside details better than anyone else

610
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,656
I won't torture you to make you confess

611
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:29,101
but if you utter any lies today

612
00:29:29,922 --> 00:29:33,001
I'll make you suffer greater things than death

613
00:29:34,897 --> 00:29:36,025
I heard that when he was discovered

614
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,987
he's already disguised himself as a beggar to prevent being killed

615
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:42,629
Imperial Doctor Liu, you can say nothing right now

616
00:29:42,629 --> 00:29:44,588
but if you don't say anything now

617
00:29:44,588 --> 00:29:46,304
I'll expel you from the palace

618
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,068
I think that before you get out of Jing City

619
00:29:49,068 --> 00:29:50,267
your body and head would be in different places

620
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:54,064
So embarrassing. If you don't tell the truth

621
00:29:54,064 --> 00:29:56,206
you would be digging your own grave

622
00:29:57,939 --> 00:30:00,558
Emperor, Lady Mei Zhuang really wasn't pregnant

623
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:02,395
I know

624
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:04,872
Actually Lady Mei Zhuang didn't know either

625
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:06,226
that she wasn't pregnant

626
00:30:06,226 --> 00:30:08,402
When courtier was taking care of Lady

627
00:30:08,402 --> 00:30:09,947
it was confirmed she hasn't had her period

628
00:30:09,947 --> 00:30:12,830
but those dizziness, vomiting symptoms

629
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,041
are side effects of medicine, not pregnancy

630
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:18,212
But before Courtier checked Lady Mei Zhuang's pulse

631
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:19,147
I was ordered

632
00:30:19,147 --> 00:30:22,032
to report that she is pregnant regardless of what her pulse was

633
00:30:22,568 --> 00:30:24,889
Ordered to? By whose order?

634
00:30:25,612 --> 00:30:26,478
That

635
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:30,000
She is gonna kill you and you are still covering up for her?

636
00:30:32,135 --> 00:30:33,869
Hua Fei. It's Hua Fei.

637
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:39,423
If you dare to utter a single false word

638
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,454
Courtier doesn't dare! Courtier doesn't dare!

639
00:30:41,454 --> 00:30:43,155
Courtier knows that my sin deserves a death sentence

640
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:46,001
That day, Hua Fei Niang Niang gave courtier some silver

641
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:48,209
and told Courtier to immediately leave Yuanmingyuan to avoid trouble

642
00:30:48,209 --> 00:30:49,625
and comforted me by saying

643
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,779
there would be people inside the city to take care of me

644
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:54,477
but how did I know that would I be chased after once I entered the city?

645
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:58,254
so Courtier was forced to be like a stray dog

646
00:31:00,219 --> 00:31:02,354
Little Yunzi, take him out and watch him carefully

647
00:31:02,354 --> 00:31:03,838
don't allow any accidents to happen

648
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:04,766
Yes

649
00:31:06,092 --> 00:31:07,878
Get up. Go

650
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:11,913
Emperor cease your anger

651
00:31:12,766 --> 00:31:17,055
Would there be any falseness to Liu Ben's testimony?

652
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:19,717
There are actually several suspicious points to Shen Daying's matter that day

653
00:31:19,717 --> 00:31:21,250
it's just that there are no evidence

654
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,110
Now that you think about it more intricately

655
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,613
If Shen Daying really got her period a few days before

656
00:31:25,613 --> 00:31:28,651
then why must those blood-stained clothes be thrown away

657
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:30,503
when the Emperor is there?

658
00:31:31,566 --> 00:31:33,517
And Shen Dayingn previous mentioned

659
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,773
that Imperial Doctor Jiang once gave her a medicine for helping her to become pregnant

660
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:37,762
It just happened that when she wanted it, it was gone

661
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:39,997
If that medicine never existed

662
00:31:39,997 --> 00:31:42,960
Shen Daying mentioning it out of nowhere is extremely foolish

663
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,142
Emperor probably doesn't believe me

664
00:31:45,142 --> 00:31:47,650
but Courtier Concubine has seen that medicine before

665
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,574
at the moment when I saw it, I didn't think anything of it

666
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:59,529
Hua Fei. Very good

667
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:05,051
That medicine that can prove Shen Daying's innocence

668
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:06,522
was probably stolen

669
00:32:07,066 --> 00:32:08,709
And that palace maid called Fu Lin

670
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:11,132
was probably the culprit

671
00:32:12,368 --> 00:32:15,361
I was too angry at the moment and ordered her to be killed

672
00:32:16,364 --> 00:32:18,138
If I had investigated more closely that day

673
00:32:19,686 --> 00:32:21,080
it would be different today

674
00:32:21,657 --> 00:32:22,776
Emperor can't be blamed for this

675
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:24,944
Fu Lin even dared to wrong Shen Daying

676
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,195
she wouldn't have changed her words

677
00:32:28,317 --> 00:32:31,992
But now what does Emperor plan to do?

678
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:36,428
I've wronged Mei Er. Release her

679
00:32:36,428 --> 00:32:38,339
and recover her position

680
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:39,912
I fear that she won't be out soon

681
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:40,983
Did she?

682
00:32:41,243 --> 00:32:43,618
No, she didn't commit suicide

683
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:47,704
but she was extremely depressed and unfortunately have contracted the plague

684
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,868
I've only ordered her to be grounded

685
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:51,791
she shouldn't have been so depressed

686
00:32:52,459 --> 00:32:53,948
Although Emperor's grounding Mei Jie Jie

687
00:32:53,948 --> 00:32:55,534
wasn't a very severe punishment

688
00:32:55,534 --> 00:32:57,489
People in the palace

689
00:32:57,489 --> 00:32:59,736
all do their tasks according to the Emperor's mood

690
00:32:59,736 --> 00:33:02,348
thus all the servants despised her

691
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:05,450
I shall immediately order the imperial doctor

692
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,444
to treat Lady Hui for her illness

693
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:11,351
I want her to live on well

694
00:33:14,835 --> 00:33:16,265
Please excuse Courtier Concubine's disrepectful crime

695
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:19,194
Courtier Concubines saw that Shen Daying was very sick

696
00:33:19,194 --> 00:33:22,630
so I've already privately asked an imperial doctor to diagnose and heal her

697
00:33:23,028 --> 00:33:23,917
Really?

698
00:33:23,944 --> 00:33:25,000
Emperor please forgive this sin

699
00:33:25,852 --> 00:33:28,495
If it weren't for you risking your life for this action

700
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,965
I fear I would really have wronged Lady Hui

701
00:33:33,672 --> 00:33:34,731
This has nothing to do with Emperor

702
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:38,194
It was the crafty work of an evil person who blurred Emperor's vision.

703
00:33:45,098 --> 00:33:49,685
Hua Fei has fooled me to this extent. I cannot accept it.

704
00:33:51,977 --> 00:33:52,740
Su Peisheng!

705
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:58,871
Servant is here.

706
00:33:59,357 --> 00:34:05,301
Go pass this edict to the Imperial Medicin House: Grant death to Jiang Cheng, Jiang Sheng

707
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:09,317
Consort Hua <br> Remove her titles and return her to the rank of Noble Lady.

708
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:18,407
Wait. Remove her titles and return her to the rank of Imperial Concubine.

709
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:22,856
Emperor. To remove her ranks is a great dishonor.

710
00:34:22,856 --> 00:34:24,683
It is much harsher than moving her down a rank.

711
00:34:25,652 --> 00:34:26,691
Emperor is this angry because...

712
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:28,052
First go to Xian Fu Palace.

713
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:35,240
What is important now is to heal her illness.

714
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:38,609
Yes. It's just, the removal of ranks for Lady Hua...

715
00:34:39,347 --> 00:34:40,411
It is already very late at night.

716
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,417
If we pass another edict through to the department of internal affairs,

717
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:45,377
I'm afraid it will startle all the other consorts.

718
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:47,332
Then pass the edict tomorrow.

719
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:52,803
Servant will obey.

720
00:34:52,803 --> 00:34:54,829
Servant will go righ away to Xian Fu Palace to pass the edict.

721
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,493
Huan Huan, the business with Liu Ben

722
00:35:05,493 --> 00:35:08,189
you didn't purposely plan it, right?

723
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:09,556
What?

724
00:35:10,028 --> 00:35:10,942
Nothing

725
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:16,833
Emperor thinks that Courtier Concubine instructed Liu Ben

726
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:17,780
to slander Hua Fei?

727
00:35:19,974 --> 00:35:21,661
Is Courtier Concubine this kind of person in Emperor's eyes?

728
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,208
Courtier Concubine doesn't dare to, nor will be lowered to this extent.

729
00:35:29,071 --> 00:35:30,488
If Courtier Concubine really wanted to manipulate Liu Ben

730
00:35:30,488 --> 00:35:32,114
to frame Hua Fei and save Lady Hui

731
00:35:32,114 --> 00:35:34,184
it would have been done a long time ago

732
00:35:34,184 --> 00:35:36,251
I wouldn't have waited until today

733
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:38,381
when Lady Hui's life is in danger

734
00:35:41,763 --> 00:35:43,179
If Emperor really doesn't believe Courtier Concubine

735
00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:45,897
I'm sure Su Gong Gong hasn't gone far yet

736
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,299
Emperor can take back the edict

737
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:56,010
I was too suspicious. If I didn't believe you

738
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:58,752
I wouldn't have punished Hua Fei

739
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:00,198
If Emperor really believes Courtier Concubine

740
00:36:00,198 --> 00:36:02,823
you wouldn't have questioned me earlier

741
00:36:02,823 --> 00:36:03,707
Huan Huan

742
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:09,922
Courtier Concubine spoke wrongly

743
00:36:10,992 --> 00:36:13,051
It's good that you know. You may rise.

744
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:15,741
Thanks Emperor

745
00:36:46,022 --> 00:36:51,500
Hua Fei has served me for a long time. She was considerate and caring.

746
00:36:53,685 --> 00:36:55,487
Though she's somewhat arrogant usually

747
00:36:57,854 --> 00:37:02,776
but the thing today, I was really disappointed

748
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:06,296
Courtier Concubine understands

749
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,896
Congratulations to Palace of Salty Blessings and Lady Hui

750
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:13,373
Emperor already ordered to remove Lady Hui from her grounding

751
00:37:14,406 --> 00:37:15,995
All rewards will just be like before

752
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:17,964
Thanks to the Emperor's great kindness

753
00:37:21,017 --> 00:37:21,945
Congratulations

754
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:24,691
Thanks Su Gong Gong

755
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:27,830
The great injustice has finally been brought to justice. This is a great happy event

756
00:37:28,299 --> 00:37:29,071
Yeah

757
00:37:30,223 --> 00:37:34,892
But...Lady Hui wouldn't be able to hear this herself

758
00:37:36,678 --> 00:37:38,522
Has she still not woken?

759
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:48,377
Milord Wen, Lady's fever has gone

760
00:37:48,377 --> 00:37:50,375
but she has vomited the medicine

761
00:37:51,254 --> 00:37:52,104
how much?

762
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,609
she would throw up one spoonful out of the three she drank

763
00:37:56,636 --> 00:37:58,493
I did prescribe according to the symptoms

764
00:37:58,493 --> 00:38:00,067
and boiled the medicine according to the formula

765
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:02,466
maybe the nature of the medicine was too strong

766
00:38:02,466 --> 00:38:05,815
maybe it'll work if I change it up

767
00:38:10,677 --> 00:38:14,766
Milord Wen, has Lady gotten any better?

768
00:38:15,617 --> 00:38:16,457
She has gotten a little better

769
00:38:17,342 --> 00:38:18,992
but her sickness was discovered late

770
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:21,658
and she was too sick so she hasn't woken yet

771
00:38:21,658 --> 00:38:23,386
please let me think of more ways

772
00:38:25,145 --> 00:38:26,713
Milord has a righteous heart

773
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:30,321
I heart that Milord has already been here for a whole day and night

774
00:38:32,053 --> 00:38:33,293
If I can't cure Lady

775
00:38:33,293 --> 00:38:35,626
I would feel guilty in my heart

776
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:39,612
Milord Wen's hard work

777
00:38:39,612 --> 00:38:42,977
servant will surely report to Emperor so that he can reward you

778
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,647
Lady, now that the plague is so severe

779
00:38:46,647 --> 00:38:48,973
why do we still have to go visit Lady Mei Zhuang?

780
00:38:50,012 --> 00:38:51,636
Emperor has ordered to recover Lady Hui's position

781
00:38:51,636 --> 00:38:53,919
so Lady Hui must've been very ill

782
00:38:54,926 --> 00:38:58,017
but don't worry, there are guards outside

783
00:38:58,017 --> 00:38:59,754
we won't be able to go in anyways

784
00:39:00,624 --> 00:39:02,102
we'll just greet her from the outside

785
00:39:02,477 --> 00:39:03,305
Yes

786
00:39:05,736 --> 00:39:06,754
Ten thousand peace to An Changzai

787
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:10,723
Hi Xia Gong Gong, I've come to see Lady Hui

788
00:39:10,998 --> 00:39:12,121
Imperial Doctor's busy inside

789
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:13,698
it won't be convenient for Lady to go in

790
00:39:13,698 --> 00:39:16,603
besides, it's not good to go near the plague

791
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:18,298
Lady should stay far away

792
00:39:18,602 --> 00:39:20,021
Gong Gong, please convey to Lady Hui

793
00:39:20,021 --> 00:39:21,300
that I've come and seen Lady Hui

794
00:39:21,781 --> 00:39:22,831
Servant will surely tell them

795
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:29,127
Oh and how did Emperor suddenly thought of recovering Lady Hui's position?

796
00:39:29,127 --> 00:39:30,906
Didn't Lady Wan tell Lady?

797
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:33,513
she's caught the Liu Ben who framed Lady Hui

798
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,770
Really?

799
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,713
It's fine if Lady doesn't believe servant

800
00:39:37,935 --> 00:39:39,128
You are one of the imperial servants

801
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:40,703
how can I not believe you?

802
00:39:40,703 --> 00:39:43,804
it's just that this message came too suddenly

803
00:39:43,804 --> 00:39:45,337
it certainly is happiness out of the blue

804
00:39:46,148 --> 00:39:47,729
It's good that Lady believes servant

805
00:39:47,729 --> 00:39:51,703
Now that Liu Ben is caught, someone will have to suffer great misfortune

806
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,184
Who is it?

807
00:39:56,305 --> 00:39:57,468
I can't tell you

808
00:39:57,468 --> 00:39:59,877
