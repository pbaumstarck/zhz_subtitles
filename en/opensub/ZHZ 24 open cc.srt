1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,926
<i> ~ Episode 24 ~</i>

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,041
Bao juan<br>who do you think is going to be in deep trouble now?

3
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:12,579
Whoever harmed Lady Hui of course

4
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:16,588
how sad that even Hua Fei doesn't even know herself

5
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:18,895
but one has many thoughts and dreams during the night

6
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:20,879
perhaps after tonight

7
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,531
Emperor wouldn't be angry anymore

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,474
How do you think she will react when she knows of this?

9
00:00:26,757 --> 00:00:28,015
According to Hua Fei's personality

10
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:29,654
she would either go to Chief General Nian

11
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,818
or she would immediately kill Lliu Ben

12
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,535
then she would go to the Emperor crying, begging for mercy

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,668
Yeah, when she throws her tantrum

14
00:00:37,668 --> 00:00:39,477
it would be hard for Emperor to not get angry at her

15
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:42,206
When we passed Palace of Wings earlier

16
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:44,620
it was quiet inside

17
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:45,963
it was pretty quiet

18
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,360
but before she was the mistress in the palace

19
00:00:48,946 --> 00:00:50,759
now the one who determines whether she's quiet or not

20
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:53,561
is Lady

21
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:55,310
then go quickly

22
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:56,802
to Palace of Wings

23
00:01:00,112 --> 00:01:01,005
Niang Niang

24
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:03,234
you're always in the Imperial Hospital searching for medicine books and looking up drugs

25
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:04,788
now that you're back, you're still looking at them

26
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,525
Now it's almost one o'clock

27
00:01:07,257 --> 00:01:09,025
Niang Niang, you should go rest now

28
00:01:09,345 --> 00:01:11,399
Look at you, your eyes are red

29
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:13,630
you are just rambling useless words here

30
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,346
go bring more candles here

31
00:01:16,548 --> 00:01:17,311
Yes

32
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,206
Niang Niang, bad news, Liu Ben has been brought back

33
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,083
What? Liu Ben has been found?

34
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:26,512
Who found him? Where?

35
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:27,924
Servant does not know the details

36
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:29,768
Servant only heard An Changzai's palace maid

37
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:31,408
talking with the servant girls of our palace

38
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:32,258
that's how I knew

39
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:36,978
An Changzai...then it must be done by Zhen Huan

40
00:01:38,746 --> 00:01:40,108
a band of useless things

41
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,755
even a weak imperial doctor they can't kill

42
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:47,239
Don't be anxious Niang Niang. Since Liu Ben's been brought back

43
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,019
he would undoubtedly tell about Lady Hui's matter

44
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:50,785
Rather than Niang Niang being angry

45
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:53,239
how about calming down and think of ways to counter him

46
00:01:55,812 --> 00:01:57,797
Hurry. Hurry and go tell older brother

47
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:01,731
Niang Niang, the palace doors are already locked at this time

48
00:02:02,712 --> 00:02:03,922
If Emperor is angry

49
00:02:03,922 --> 00:02:05,345
even if Chief General Nian comes

50
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:07,478
he would not be able to interfere with Emperor's household matters

51
00:02:09,812 --> 00:02:10,855
what shall we do then?

52
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,952
I can't sit here and wait for my death

53
00:02:14,914 --> 00:02:16,304
we're all in the same boat

54
00:02:17,432 --> 00:02:21,206
the two Jiang brothers also cannot be exempt from this

55
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:22,831
Zhou Ninghai

56
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:23,245
Yes

57
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:25,407
Tell these two brothers to keep their mouths shut for me

58
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:30,406
go report to the Emperor when it's morning that I am severely sick

59
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:33,294
If I am sick

60
00:02:33,294 --> 00:02:36,470
Emperor wouldn't give me harsh punishments

61
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,439
Servant understands. Servant shall immediately go do it

62
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:44,394
Niang Niang wanting to block those two's mouths

63
00:02:44,394 --> 00:02:45,449
is a good idea

64
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:48,185
but if you want to regain Emperor's affection

65
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:50,923
you can't just rely on Emperor's old sentiments

66
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:53,668
you have to give Emperor what he wants the most right now

67
00:02:55,146 --> 00:02:57,814
Emperor punishing Niang Niang

68
00:02:57,814 --> 00:03:01,220
is because Niang Niang has sinned and you must be punished for sins

69
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,466
you also must be rewarded for accomplishments

70
00:03:04,328 --> 00:03:06,207
If Niang Niang can accomplish something great right now

71
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:09,804
and atone for your sins with your accomplishment, it would be easier for Emperor to step down

72
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:12,198
and block those rumorous tongues for Niang Niang

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,301
Sins must be punished for and not just easily forgiven

74
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:25,068
Later go send out my edict to Palace of Wings

75
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:28,367
Ye<br>Servant shall go right now

76
00:03:29,682 --> 00:03:32,684
Everyday in court I am worried by the plague

77
00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:34,882
I don't know when this will come to an end

78
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,393
The Strong labor the body, the Wise labor the heart

79
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:40,982
Emperor labors both the heart and the body so you are extra tired of course

80
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:42,559
Your coaxing

81
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:45,630
will help me stay energized even when I'm the tiredest

82
00:03:47,278 --> 00:03:48,945
Yesterday I didn't state myself clearly

83
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:50,867
don't let it get to you

84
00:03:51,924 --> 00:03:52,612
Courtier Concubine doesn't dare

85
00:04:00,947 --> 00:04:01,922
Fortune to Hua Fei Niang Niang

86
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:02,679
You may rise

87
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:04,403
Where's the Emperor?

88
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,057
Emperor's changing right now to go to the morning imperial court session

89
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:08,691
Servant was just about to go to Palace of Wings

90
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:11,250
No need. I have a matter to ask of the Emperor

91
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:13,910
Niang Niang, right now Emperor is

92
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,633
too busy to see you

93
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,961
Whether he has time or not to see me is the Emperor's business

94
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:19,472
Whether to tell the Emperor or not is your business

95
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,893
Then Niang Niang please wait for a moment

96
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:35,602
Emperor, Hua Fei, I mean Nian Pin is here

97
00:04:35,602 --> 00:04:36,946
and wants to see you

98
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:38,231
What is it?

99
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,714
Nian Pin Niang Niang is here with Jiang Cheng and Jiang Shen

100
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,653
the two imperial doctors

101
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:43,390
and said they must the Emperor

102
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,034
it seems to be of urgent matter

103
00:04:46,056 --> 00:04:47,809
Did you tell of her of my edict?

104
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:49,432
Nian Pin Niang Niang arrived here hurriedly

105
00:04:49,432 --> 00:04:51,009
and did not allow Servant to reply

106
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:55,098
If you didn't tell her, then don't keep on calling her Nian Pin

107
00:04:56,634 --> 00:04:58,526
Take them to Warmth of the West Pavillion to wait

108
00:04:58,912 --> 00:04:59,548
Yes

109
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,479
Emperor arrives

110
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,127
Courtier Concubine/Courtiers greet the Emperor

111
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:18,407
Ten thousand fortunes and golden peace to Hua Fei Niang Niang

112
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:21,285
You may rise

113
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:22,244
Thanks Emperor

114
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:24,427
What is it that made you so urgent to see me?

115
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:26,828
Congratulations Emperor. Courtier Concubine hears that

116
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,543
the two imperial doctors Jiang Cheng and Jiang Sheng

117
00:05:28,543 --> 00:05:30,867
have crafted the medication for treating the plague

118
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:34,324
so I've especially taken the two imperial doctors here to report to Emperor

119
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:36,189
Really

120
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:38,998
That's right. Courtier Concubine doesn't possess much knowledge in the medical field

121
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,390
so I'll let the imperial doctors to report the specifics.

122
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:48,404
Wind<br>Winter<br>Summer<br>Humidity<br>Dryness<br>Fire

123
00:05:48,404 --> 00:05:49,841
Those six evil energies enter through the mouth and the nose

124
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:52,083
If too much is inhaled, it can produce the air for plagues

125
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,461
and invade the lungs

126
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:56,848
while creating conflicts between the vital organs to create the plague

127
00:05:56,848 --> 00:05:58,620
Stop with the technical stuff. Tell me all the important stuff first.

128
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:00,942
The plague is often caused by unsanitary food

129
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:02,812
which damages the spleen and the gastrointestinal areas

130
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:05,105
We courtiers have read through many ancient medical books

131
00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:06,398
and crafted a prescription for the plague

132
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:08,316
It has been named the "Plague Emergency Pill"

133
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:10,616
This medicine is warm in nature and cannot stand humidity

134
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:12,697
It will heal the liver and the kidney while recovering the original energy

135
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:15,210
Do the imperial doctors of the Imperial Hospital

136
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,091
think it is viable?

137
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:17,436
Yes

138
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:19,459
It's already been administered to a couple of little eunuchs

139
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:22,285
After two servings, they've shown signs of the fever decreasing

140
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:26,514
Good. Good

141
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:31,595
Niang Niang

142
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,899
Emperor forgive this crime. Courtier Concubine was unmannered

143
00:06:37,081 --> 00:06:39,168
Are you unwell? Hurry and sit down

144
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,800
Thanks Emperor

145
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,967
When Niang Niang heard us courtiers talk

146
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,115
about how the prescription might be inside ancient books

147
00:06:44,115 --> 00:06:46,101
she has stayed up just to look through all the volumes

148
00:06:46,746 --> 00:06:48,343
The last several days she has stayed up late also

149
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,106
Thus resulting in her body feeling weak

150
00:06:51,847 --> 00:06:55,153
Courtier Concubine is foolish and doesn't deserve to serve Emperor

151
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:56,930
only making the Emperor angry every single time

152
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,082
so I've tried to find ways

153
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:01,758
to help the Emperor with your worries

154
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:04,861
My beloved Fei has worked hard

155
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,303
Su Peisheng

156
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:09,458
Servant is here

157
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:11,683
Take a few people with you and go with Imperial Doctor Jiang

158
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:14,818
first take the medicine to Lady Hui's Preserved Chrysanthemum Hall

159
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:18,221
and then it to all the palace servants

160
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:19,221
Yes

161
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:30,032
Lady Hui

162
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:34,663
I've already recovered Shen's position

163
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:38,629
I had wronged her in all those previous matters

164
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,744
Then Family Shen's Mei Mei has truly been wronged

165
00:07:44,014 --> 00:07:45,787
Emperor really should compensate for her

166
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:49,503
Congratulations to Lady Wan

167
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,743
You and her, being sisters, can finally be at rest

168
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:57,041
Many thanks to Hua Fei Niang Niang

169
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:02,849
Courtier Concubine won't ask the Emperor to forgive my mistakes of the past

170
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,233
but only ask that Emperor's dragon body won't be damaged

171
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,480
because of being angry at Courtier Concubine

172
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:10,539
Courtier Concubine is just an unimportant person

173
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:14,100
but Emperor's body belongs to all the citizens

174
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:19,310
Ok. Today you really did achieve a great feat.

175
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,577
If this medication can really heal the plague

176
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:25,576
it would be the fortune of everyone

177
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:29,164
I am not one who commends and chastes wrongly

178
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,871
Emperor is divinely wise

179
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:50,397
Lady Lady

180
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,715
Is Emperor still going to punish the two imperial doctors?

181
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:55,812
and his edict concerning Glory Fei Niang Niang?

182
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:57,659
does Servant still need to send it?

183
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:01,784
Servant should be asking Emperor about this

184
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:03,259
but you see, there are people inside

185
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,499
So Lady, please pity Servant

186
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:12,317
Under the current circumstances, there's no need for you to go

187
00:09:13,611 --> 00:09:14,841
If you go

188
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:18,134
it would probably be an edict for adding the titles

189
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:34,212
Milord Wen, Imperial Doctor Jiang sent Servant here to give you

190
00:09:34,212 --> 00:09:35,794
medicine for curing Lady Hui's plague

191
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:38,117
What? Imperial Doctor Jiang has aso crafted

192
00:09:38,117 --> 00:09:39,421
medicine for curing the plague?

193
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:41,639
Place it here for me to see

194
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:02,961
Emperor arrives

195
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:09,740
Ten thousand fortunes and golden peace to Emperor

196
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,628
Hurry and rise. You are having breakfast?

197
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,409
Is it suiting your appetite?

198
00:10:15,696 --> 00:10:18,278
Even the best food will taste foul to me. People who eat bone marrow once will lust after it more.

199
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:20,469
They're all works of the Imperial Kitchen

200
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:21,958
Courtier Concubine doesn't dare to be picky

201
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:24,058
Sit

202
00:10:27,686 --> 00:10:28,821
The Imperial Kitchen's meals

203
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:30,516
must suit everyone's taste

204
00:10:30,516 --> 00:10:32,965
They won't exclude one person in making the meals

205
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,380
just like I have to care for the bigger situations

206
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:38,401
Yes, Courtier Concubine understands

207
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:40,208
Right now the epidemic is raging

208
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:44,190
The medicine created so painstakingly by Glory Fei and Imperial Doctor Jiang

209
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,255
can be counted as a repentance for their crime

210
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:49,438
As for Liu Ben, I've already given him the death sentence

211
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:52,560
that will take away some of Lady Hui's injustice

212
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,442
Liu Ben wasn't the main meditator for harming Jie Jie (older sister)

213
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:03,227
I know. Right now there are no other solutions

214
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:06,352
I haven't forgotten the matter about Lady Hui

215
00:11:06,352 --> 00:11:08,044
and I won't just easily let it go

216
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:12,541
The most important thing is Emperor's health

217
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,974
Courtier Concubine doesn't have any insecurities

218
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:18,155
That's good. But these days

219
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:20,291
I might have to ignore you a bit

220
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:25,219
Emperor is busy with governing the court. Courtier Concubine understands

221
00:11:26,198 --> 00:11:27,503
Then I shall go first

222
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:30,435
Emperor leaves

223
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:41,726
Emperor's eyes are black and blue underneath

224
00:11:41,726 --> 00:11:44,771
It seems that he really has been tired these few days

225
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:46,944
Emperor was tired last night

226
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,493
Tell Little Kitchen to make a bowl of ginseng soup

227
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:52,793
and take it to Palace of Resting Soul

228
00:11:53,882 --> 00:11:58,398
Lady, Emperor also has no choice in some matters

229
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:04,913
In the harem, a woman's future and the amount of love she receives

230
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:07,684
all rest on the Emperor's pillow

231
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:11,313
Emperor's situation is the same

232
00:12:13,137 --> 00:12:17,464
When two people are deeply in love, all conflicts will eventually dissolve like smoke

233
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:19,951
I guess it's mutual understanding

234
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,023
This kind of thing is common in the palace

235
00:12:23,023 --> 00:12:24,876
Lady doesn't need to mind it so much

236
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,747
I don't mind. I'm just disappointed.

237
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:33,162
I never thought that Emperor would suspect me

238
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,720
I know about Emperor's oversuspicions

239
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:41,134
Even when he wronged Mei Jie Jie that day

240
00:12:41,134 --> 00:12:42,289
and I thought about it

241
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:45,084
will Emperor distrust me one day?

242
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:51,592
but even now, I'm still very sad

243
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:55,751
The battles and conflicts between royal concubines

244
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,271
are the least important

245
00:12:57,271 --> 00:13:00,720
The most important is who Emperor chooses to trust

246
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:04,501
so Lady, instead of being sad here

247
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:09,344
why not think about how to lessen Emperor's suspicions

248
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:14,273
Why didn't you say "how to make Emperor not suspicious?"

249
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,593
If Lady thinks you can do it

250
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:19,324
I can also say it like that

251
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:26,566
What happened?

252
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:31,300
How did you go from being well to vomiting and chest tightness?

253
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,896
wasn't the fetus already stable?

254
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:39,118
Answer Emperor: no worries

255
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,858
Lady only ate too much and was bloated

256
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:43,916
that's why she feels chest tightness

257
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,361
she just needs to take a lighter dinner and she'll be well

258
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:49,538
How did you not differentiate between feeling bloated

259
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,714
and actually feeling unwell?

260
00:13:52,261 --> 00:13:54,394
Courtier Concubine was only afraid

261
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,007
Enough. You lie here and take a rest

262
00:13:58,007 --> 00:14:00,721
I still have matters to take care of. I'll see you tonight

263
00:14:00,913 --> 00:14:01,655
Emperor

264
00:14:01,768 --> 00:14:06,321
Ok ok. When I tell you I will come, I will come

265
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:10,367
Emperor leaves

266
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,229
Escorts Emperor out

267
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,183
Good. Good

268
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,868
Nian Fu didn't disappoint me

269
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:31,089
and stopped the revolt at Mountain Zhuo Zi

270
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:35,450
Without a tiger-like father, there wouldn't be such a fierce son

271
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:38,307
Emperor, it's almost time for lunch

272
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:41,250
Are you going to eat here at Palace of Resting Soul

273
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,307
or to one of the ladies' palaces to eat?

274
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:46,728
Didn't the Imperial Kitchen make

275
00:14:46,728 --> 00:14:48,976
pearl sea rice with simmered quail?

276
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:49,934
Yes

277
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:52,338
I remember that Fei of Glory liked it the most

278
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:54,171
so let's go to Palace of Wings

279
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:55,641
What a coincidence then!

280
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:58,368
People from Palace of Wings just came to invite Emperor over

281
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,835
it seems that I and Fei of Glory have connected heart and mind

282
00:15:04,922 --> 00:15:07,147
abalone braised pearls, fish stomach simmered with sausage

283
00:15:07,147 --> 00:15:11,154
Shark chicken stew, and mushroom with cabbage heart

284
00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:13,732
these are all Emperor's favorites

285
00:15:14,326 --> 00:15:16,250
these dishes all require the most effort to make

286
00:15:17,665 --> 00:15:20,267
you must have woken up at the latter half of the night

287
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,578
to keep an eye on the cooks

288
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:23,454
Emperor's food

289
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:25,337
Courtier Concubine must see for myself

290
00:15:26,152 --> 00:15:27,902
Just eating one meal causes you so much effort

291
00:15:27,902 --> 00:15:30,055
I really feel reluctant

292
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,761
To pour out my heart and soul for Emperor, Courtier Concubine would do anything

293
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:39,585
Emperor must be hungry after reading papers for the whole morning

294
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:41,724
drink a bowl of chicken soup to warm up your stomach

295
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,427
Emperor's appetite is good today

296
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:50,272
have there been any happy events?

297
00:15:50,812 --> 00:15:51,664
Guess

298
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:55,670
Is it because of that child Nian Fu who didn't disappoint the imperial grace

299
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,858
and pacified the revolt at Mount Zhuo Zi?

300
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:01,596
Your reporters are really fast

301
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:03,845
how did you know so quickly

302
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,902
the reports came in the early morning

303
00:16:05,902 --> 00:16:07,724
Courtier Concubine is happy for Nian Fu as well

304
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:11,663
Nian Fu is young but talented

305
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:14,850
he didn't fail Nian Geng Yao's teachings to him

306
00:16:15,722 --> 00:16:17,423
This child Nian Fu's first military expedition ended so quickly

307
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:19,148
Courtier Concubine was happy for a whole morning

308
00:16:19,148 --> 00:16:22,196
What does Emperor think should be his reward?

309
00:16:22,673 --> 00:16:23,673
Since you love him so much

310
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:26,975
reward some silver and the four treasures of study

311
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:29,748
A boy who's on the battlefield

312
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:31,106
doesn't care for these

313
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,305
then you say what he shold be reward with

314
00:16:34,351 --> 00:16:36,337
My older brother's oldest son Nian Bin has already been knighted

315
00:16:36,337 --> 00:16:39,014
Though Nian Fu is only the second child

316
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:41,223
but his courage and skills are not below his brother

317
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:45,023
Emperor why not reward him with a knighthood position?

318
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:46,842
that would allow them two brothers

319
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:49,174
to all the more help Emperor together

320
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:54,931
Nian Fu is very young, and he only just made an achievement on the battlefield

321
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,327
if I grant him a knighthood now

322
00:16:57,327 --> 00:17:01,500
it would be too early. Wait two years

323
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,483
Emperor now loves Courtier Concubine's older brother more than Courtier Concubine

324
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,597
If older brother were the one to suggest this

325
00:17:07,597 --> 00:17:09,456
Emperor would surely think older brother was

326
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:11,902
being understanding to the warriors and appeasing them

327
00:17:12,503 --> 00:17:13,566
If Courtier Concubine was the one to say it

328
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,748
Emperor would think Courtier Concubine was only thinking like a woman

329
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:20,140
Your brother also came to seek a reward for Nian Fu?

330
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:22,628
Older brother loves Nian Fu the most

331
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:25,532
that's what Courtier Concubine thinks

332
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,229
Eat first

333
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:51,423
Fine. Fine.

334
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:56,782
I will grant your older brother with the knighthood of First Male

335
00:17:57,893 --> 00:18:00,565
and Nian Fu will inherit his position. How's that?

336
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:07,075
Emperor~Emperor always makes Courtier Concubine impatient

337
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:10,401
to go my way. What if Courtier Concubine doesn't comply?

338
00:18:21,471 --> 00:18:22,463
Emperor

339
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,505
Lady, the medicine is ready

340
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:32,046
Lady, this medicine will help make your cough better

341
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,990
The air is always different, suddenly cold and suddenly warm

342
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:40,126
I will probably get well slower

343
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,294
Getting well is like pulling silk. How can you get well so fast?

344
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:45,677
As long as Lady treats herself right, you will get better

345
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,618
Report to Lady: at the eighth hour (around 1-3 pm) Emperor wants to

346
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:53,512
see Lady at the Western Warmth Pavilion

347
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:55,611
thanks to Gong Gong

348
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:56,563
Servant shall leave now

349
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,013
Gong Gong leave peacefully

350
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:06,093
This paper from Nian Geng Yao

351
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:07,422
when did it come in?

352
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:12,716
It was around lunch time

353
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,240
At lunch Fei of Glory pleaded me

354
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,558
to reward Nian Fu

355
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:22,098
This paper from Nian Geng Yao begs me

356
00:19:22,098 --> 00:19:26,243
to reward all the soldiers who ceased the revolt

357
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,202
these two siblings' thoughts

358
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,533
really are at one

359
00:19:32,646 --> 00:19:33,682
Su Peisheng

360
00:19:33,682 --> 00:19:34,517
Servant is here

361
00:19:35,063 --> 00:19:38,947
do you still want your head as the head eunuch?

362
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,704
Emperor, Servant deserves to die, Servant deserves to die

363
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,220
but Servant is foolish, Emperor please clarify

364
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:47,797
so that Servant can die knowing what I died for

365
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:49,416
your eyes are not sharp enough

366
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:53,581
there are people messaging back and forth in and out of the palace

367
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:55,233
and you did not even know

368
00:19:55,818 --> 00:19:58,311
You are just like me, a foolish person

369
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:01,443
Emperor forgive me. Emperor forgive me.

370
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,278
Emperor please let Servant go this time

371
00:20:04,278 --> 00:20:06,626
Servant will certainly strengthen the security from now on

372
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:09,659
If I don't let you live and pay for your error

373
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:13,507
Why would I be scolding you? Get up.

374
00:20:14,137 --> 00:20:15,068
Thank you, Emperor

375
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:25,758
Emperor, please have some tea and calm down

376
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,487
Call Wan Concubine

377
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:30,788
Of Course

378
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:49,863
Look at this.

379
00:20:51,406 --> 00:20:52,524
I dare not look at this

380
00:20:52,905 --> 00:20:54,635
This is a family matter. I'm allowing you to look

381
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:08,270
Emperor, Zhao Zhi Yuan is accusing my father

382
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:11,306
Zhao Zhi Yuan is accusing your father of being

383
00:21:11,306 --> 00:21:13,159
as a bad minister and disobeying my orders

384
00:21:13,757 --> 00:21:15,272
what does he mean by this?

385
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:17,162
All he's saying is

386
00:21:17,162 --> 00:21:19,398
is because my father didn't bow to the general like all other men

387
00:21:19,975 --> 00:21:22,350
Everyone think I favor and trust Nian Geng Yao (the general)

388
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:25,402
So they all fawn over him

389
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:27,364
because they think they are following in my steps

390
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,811
Emperor, your respect for the general

391
00:21:29,811 --> 00:21:31,815
is because the general has done great things for the nation

392
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:35,590
But no matter what good he's done, he as to obey the rules

393
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,750
He has to respect you and the other dukes

394
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:40,135
He should obey the ettique that has been set

395
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:43,574
You also think I've over favored Nian General?

396
00:21:43,847 --> 00:21:45,857
I dare not, I just think

397
00:21:45,857 --> 00:21:47,749
that even with the favor of the emperor

398
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:50,187
Nian General shouldn't be too egotistical

399
00:21:50,187 --> 00:21:51,570
and disrespect all other officials

400
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:55,064
Also, Zhao Zhi Yuan is a official of internal affairs

401
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,376
He's not actually reporting on internal affairs

402
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,374
and is complaining about manners and etiquette

403
00:21:59,374 --> 00:22:01,533
He's finding every excuse to help Nian General

404
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,740
This paper has deep implications, I need to look it over carefully

405
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:27,469
Little Mistress, be patient

406
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:30,466
The Emperor is talking to Wan concubine

407
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,797
Since the emperor has important things

408
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:34,402
then it's okay that I wait

409
00:22:36,977 --> 00:22:39,029
How about this, I will go in again

410
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:40,395
and announce your arrival

411
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:41,693
thank you for your troubles

412
00:22:47,563 --> 00:22:48,321
Emperor

413
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,236
What is it?

414
00:22:50,926 --> 00:22:53,739
An Cheng has been outside for a long time

415
00:22:53,778 --> 00:22:55,061
I am busy

416
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:57,786
Emperor, An sister has been sick

417
00:22:57,786 --> 00:23:00,002
The wind is fierce outside, it's not wise to let her stay outside too long

418
00:23:00,002 --> 00:23:02,478
Perhaps I should go?

419
00:23:02,992 --> 00:23:04,494
I still have things to say to you

420
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:06,365
Suo Fei shi

421
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:07,138
Your servant is here

422
00:23:07,364 --> 00:23:08,486
Tell An Cheng

423
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:10,694
I don't have the time to see her

424
00:23:10,694 --> 00:23:12,653
Tell her to go back and rest

425
00:23:13,328 --> 00:23:13,951
yes, emperor

426
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:22,010
Little Mistress, I'm very sorry

427
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,403
The Emperor wants you to go back

428
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,087
Right now, Wan concubine is in there

429
00:23:27,087 --> 00:23:29,645
The Emperor really has no time to see you

430
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:33,431
Since the emperor has elder sister to serve him. it's alright

431
00:23:34,553 --> 00:23:35,839
Then I shall go first

432
00:24:00,863 --> 00:24:01,999
Little miss has been at palace

433
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:03,233
for so long and in the cold

434
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,681
now your cough is worse, what to do?

435
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:10,922
It's my fault

436
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:13,625
I knew that Wan concubine was in there

437
00:24:14,624 --> 00:24:16,292
I still tried foolishly to try and see him

438
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,273
And was sent back

439
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,445
That wan concubine

440
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:24,351
She knows that your body's weak

441
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,181
Since the emperor has no time

442
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:28,137
then she should have reminded him earlier

443
00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:30,419
instead she made you wait in the cold wind

444
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:35,818
Little Mistress, your hands must be cold, hold this

445
00:24:44,268 --> 00:24:46,453
Royal Concubine, I've just heard

446
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:48,684
That at the Emperor's morning meeting, Wan Concubine's father

447
00:24:48,684 --> 00:24:50,713
Was demoted to a lesser position

448
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:53,479
yes

449
00:24:54,232 --> 00:24:56,468
In all of the concubines, she's been so show-off and standoffish

450
00:24:56,468 --> 00:24:59,546
because her family has been powerful

451
00:24:59,546 --> 00:25:01,374
now that her father's been demoted

452
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,526
I want to see how she'll lift her head now

453
00:25:03,772 --> 00:25:06,624
Zhao Zhi Yao seems like someone who knows how to do his job

454
00:25:06,624 --> 00:25:08,907
I having given my brother (nian general) a hint

455
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:10,640
Zhao Zhi Yao made that report

456
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:16,051
It seems that Wan Concubine doesn't have alot of the Emperor's heart

457
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:17,925
New people are like new novelties

458
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:20,721
but now she's not new anymore

459
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:26,050
of course, how can she compare to you, who has been in favor for many years

460
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,853
I've heard that these days

461
00:25:27,853 --> 00:25:31,279
the emperor only say wan concubine once

462
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:38,570
Her novelty's worn off

463
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,499
she's no longer the flavor of the month

464
00:25:42,304 --> 00:25:44,327
when the time comes to remove her

465
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:47,391
it's be up to you of course

466
00:25:58,654 --> 00:25:59,870
The food is cold

467
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,918
Little mistress, why haven't you eaten?

468
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:04,433
I feel annoyed, I don't want to eat

469
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:08,697
Are you mad about father's situation?

470
00:26:08,697 --> 00:26:10,662
You have to becareful of your body

471
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:14,445
Even if I was upset, what use would that be?

472
00:26:14,445 --> 00:26:16,232
it's all the emperor's will

473
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:18,844
Little Mistress's appetite has been bad

474
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,778
Should I call for the royal doctor?

475
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:21,986
no

476
00:26:21,986 --> 00:26:25,295
Wen doctor has to take care of Mei concubine's health

477
00:26:26,343 --> 00:26:28,148
I think it that a couple of days ago

478
00:26:28,148 --> 00:26:30,075
ate some oily foods

479
00:26:32,743 --> 00:26:34,342
I'm really tired

480
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,530
I'll go and sleep now

481
00:26:37,145 --> 00:26:39,884
You've been sleeping alot, like a cat

482
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:43,590
it's almost spring

483
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,870
but i still feel cold all over

484
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,917
go and get me a soup

485
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:56,703
Since the emperor has indicated that he's going to spend the night with you

486
00:26:56,703 --> 00:26:59,323
little mistress, you have to try and appear beautiful

487
00:27:00,807 --> 00:27:02,990
I went over to Concubine Wan's

488
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,465
I feel bad for her

489
00:27:05,465 --> 00:27:07,475
it's a wonder that she still can sleep

490
00:27:08,531 --> 00:27:10,546
Concubine Wan's father being demoted

491
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,734
Concubine Wan must feel terrible

492
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:17,530
There a great deal of people looking foward to see her embaressment

493
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,956
that's probably why she's making the excuse of sleeping, so she won't have to see anyone

494
00:27:21,576 --> 00:27:23,335
Since the time she's enter the palace and recieved favor

495
00:27:23,335 --> 00:27:27,684
she's been very self-satisfied. No one knew that she would face a day like this

496
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:30,529
Little mistress, you are so kind hearted

497
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:32,225
That day on the steps of the palace, she made you wait outside for so long

498
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:34,809
and yet you still pity her

499
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:38,963
Bao Juan, to be honest

500
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:41,097
Not only do I feel pity for her

501
00:27:41,097 --> 00:27:42,795
I am a bit jealous of her

502
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:44,205
jealous?

503
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:47,027
Concubine Wan is better at everything than I am

504
00:27:47,027 --> 00:27:50,882
She has more favor, the emperor likes her better

505
00:27:50,882 --> 00:27:53,284
her family is better than mine

506
00:27:53,284 --> 00:27:55,822
but now that her father's been demoted

507
00:27:55,822 --> 00:27:57,086
I feel that

508
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:59,873
I am a little less distant from her

509
00:27:59,873 --> 00:28:02,440
I don't feel that she's above be anymore

510
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,252
Little miss, it's been hard on you

511
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:07,241
I am the one pregnant with the dragon seed (emperor's child)

512
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:08,572
It's not Concubine An Cheng Zai

513
00:28:08,572 --> 00:28:10,890
Why does the Emperor go to Concubine An?

514
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,535
I think that someone is taking the opportunity since I am pregnant

515
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:13,996
And seduce the emperor

516
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,264
Don't pay attention little miss

517
00:28:15,264 --> 00:28:17,564
Fu Cha usually bullys the soft spoken

518
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:19,358
This kind of ugly talk

519
00:28:19,358 --> 00:28:21,240
Since I've lived at Yan Xi palace

520
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,862
I've heard of it a lot, I'm not going to pay attention to it

521
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,323
yes

522
00:28:25,874 --> 00:28:27,768
Since it's getting warmer

523
00:28:27,768 --> 00:28:29,418
are you getting better?

524
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:32,599
Thanks for your care, I am better

525
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:35,571
Now that Hua Concubine is taking care of the court

526
00:28:35,571 --> 00:28:37,196
I have alot of time on my hands

527
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:41,331
Before, it was because of your headaches

528
00:28:41,331 --> 00:28:44,515
So that's why I gave the management of the court to Hua concubine

529
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:46,529
I haven't even given any orders

530
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:49,127
All the people in the court

531
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,787
are only listening to Hua concubine

532
00:28:50,787 --> 00:28:55,576
She's young and efficient

533
00:28:56,261 --> 00:28:58,144
Hua concubine has the experience

534
00:28:58,144 --> 00:29:00,063
of course she is very skilled

535
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:02,851
Now that the inner court is siding with Hua concubine

536
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:05,273
I have no choice but to let her take care of the court

537
00:29:06,255 --> 00:29:10,807
The issue with Shi Yi, Hua concubine played an improtant part

538
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:14,656
now that she's more cautious and organized

539
00:29:14,656 --> 00:29:18,191
we can reinstate her old position of helping you to take care of the court

540
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:20,254
as long as you make the decision, i'll follow it

541
00:29:20,254 --> 00:29:21,913
but there is one thing

542
00:29:21,913 --> 00:29:25,437
I want to talk about on behalf of Concubine wan

543
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:27,262
I know what you want to say

544
00:29:27,262 --> 00:29:29,420
Wan Concubine's father has made a mistake

545
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,991
I have punished him

546
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:32,676
this is not Wan Concubine's fault

547
00:29:32,948 --> 00:29:34,849
Emperor you've always been able to separate your personal and work

548
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:37,719
but the people in the inner court do not think like this

549
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:39,738
Wan concubine has been a favorite

550
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:43,403
but now her father has made her a joke

551
00:29:43,403 --> 00:29:46,174
it the Emperor has the heart

552
00:29:46,174 --> 00:29:48,242
you should go see her tonight

553
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:51,167
Didn't you say

554
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:53,607
that An Concubine missed me?

555
00:29:54,787 --> 00:29:57,426
I've chose An concubined tonight

556
00:29:58,217 --> 00:30:00,854
Emperor, you've always been too busy

557
00:30:00,854 --> 00:30:04,035
Which concubine doesn't miss you?

558
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:09,367
But An concubine and wan concubine have always been good friend

559
00:30:09,367 --> 00:30:11,773
this matter about wan concubine

560
00:30:11,773 --> 00:30:13,531
I think An concubine will understand

561
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:16,980
this might be better

562
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,270
I don't want to see wan concubine

563
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,462
becuase of the troubles of her father

564
00:30:21,462 --> 00:30:22,539
face difficulties

565
00:30:23,814 --> 00:30:24,477
your servant is here

566
00:30:24,686 --> 00:30:29,603
Call wan concubine to Yang Xin palace

567
00:30:29,716 --> 00:30:30,872
Yes, emperor

568
00:30:43,952 --> 00:30:46,432
Little Miss, the emperor will come,

569
00:30:46,432 --> 00:30:48,212
just wait a moment

570
00:30:52,472 --> 00:30:54,026
The emperor rarely comes

571
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:56,038
you should go and better prepare yourself

572
00:30:56,038 --> 00:30:59,266
you don't know when the next time will be

573
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:00,783
Concubine don't worry

574
00:31:00,783 --> 00:31:02,784
when i see the emperor

575
00:31:02,784 --> 00:31:05,927
I will tell the emperor of your worries

576
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:07,735
Are you saying I won't be able to see the emperor?

577
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:08,990
How could i?

578
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,290
I just don't want to see you miss the emperor so badly

579
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,633
So I'll tell him in person

580
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:17,804
what a joke, I am pregnant with the emperor's child

581
00:31:17,804 --> 00:31:20,795
I can see him whenever I want

582
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:21,951
Of Course

583
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:25,120
But the next time you see the Emperor

584
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,496
You shouldn't say that there's no child

585
00:31:27,496 --> 00:31:29,804
when he hears this too much, he'll be annoyed

586
00:31:29,962 --> 00:31:32,120
How dare you...

587
00:31:34,907 --> 00:31:38,864
Fu Cha concubine, An Concubine, greetings

588
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:42,222
Su Gong Gong, why are you here?

589
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:44,025
the emperor has decreed

590
00:31:44,025 --> 00:31:46,843
Tonight you don't need to wait for him

591
00:31:47,304 --> 00:31:49,397
But he chose me tongiht

592
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,737
yes, he did choose you tonight

593
00:31:52,737 --> 00:31:56,122
but the emperor has ordered Wan concubined to go to him

594
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,708
She's been taken to him already

595
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:04,475
The emperor's change of heart, is a normal thing

596
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:08,439
The Emperor understands that your cough has not been healed

597
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:11,518
he wants you to rest a while

598
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:13,535
thank you

599
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:16,455
then i shall leave first

600
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,957
It seems i've overestimated you

601
00:32:24,957 --> 00:32:27,826
no chance this time, there's next time

602
00:32:29,384 --> 00:32:32,348
pity you look so pretty tonight

603
00:32:32,348 --> 00:32:34,748
the emperor doesn't even take a look

604
00:32:34,748 --> 00:32:36,909
even though he chose you, he reneges

605
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:41,474
but you guys are good sisters

606
00:32:41,474 --> 00:32:44,257
since you have no chance Wan concubine replaced you

607
00:32:44,257 --> 00:32:47,142
whoever serves the emperor is the same

608
00:32:48,006 --> 00:32:49,317
it must be difficult for her

609
00:32:49,317 --> 00:32:51,125
her father's been demoted

610
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:52,800
and yet the emperor still thinks of her

611
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,633
this kind of skill

612
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:58,719
you should learn from her

613
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:10,846
why? why did you take my chance?

614
00:33:10,846 --> 00:33:15,226
why did you have to steal mine?

615
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:19,241
you've gotten thinner

616
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:22,779
you're words are less too

617
00:33:24,724 --> 00:33:28,106
it's because of the spring, I''ve become lazy

618
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:31,483
no matter how lazy, you have to move

619
00:33:31,483 --> 00:33:33,965
you can get sick if you are not too careful

620
00:33:35,262 --> 00:33:36,353
Emperor

621
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:40,734
Fu Cha Concubine

622
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:42,147
wants to see you

623
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:44,838
She wants you to go over to her palace

624
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:48,396
You should go, I'll be fine

625
00:33:49,137 --> 00:33:51,689
Let the doctor go to her

626
00:33:53,113 --> 00:33:54,056
yes, emperor

627
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,901
Fu Cha concubine is pregnant the first time

628
00:33:57,901 --> 00:34:01,471
it wouldn't harm her if you went to see her more often

629
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:03,398
its good that you are so considerate

630
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:07,279
okay, sleep here tonight

631
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,981
and go back to your palace tomorrow

632
00:34:09,895 --> 00:34:12,689
that way you won't have to go back and forth all the time

633
00:34:13,423 --> 00:34:14,207
yes

634
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,880
greeting to the Emperor and Empress

635
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,996
rise

636
00:34:30,996 --> 00:34:32,071
thank you, emperor

637
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:38,220
you don't look good, sit

638
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:43,230
look at you, you have dark circles

639
00:34:44,222 --> 00:34:46,991
I heard that Fu Cha Concubine also asked for the Emperor

640
00:34:46,991 --> 00:34:49,088
saying that she didn't feel too good

641
00:34:49,424 --> 00:34:50,620
its no problem

642
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,416
Fu Cha was being bratty

643
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:56,812
She was blaming me for going to late

644
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:58,367
and gave me a headache

645
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,421
If there are any evil things in the palace

646
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:06,233
Hua concubine must be vigilant

647
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:08,885
So from today I;m giving Hua Concubine her power to assist in keeping the peace in the inner court

648
00:35:13,084 --> 00:35:14,436
Thank you, emperor

649
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:17,957
You must be accountable

650
00:35:17,957 --> 00:35:19,537
and help the emperess

651
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,222
congrats, sister

652
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:29,309
Jin Ping has been serving me for eight or nine years

653
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:33,486
Jin Ping is diligent and well mannered

654
00:35:33,486 --> 00:35:36,776
You are now Royal Concubine

655
00:35:40,177 --> 00:35:41,944
what? So happy that it made you dumb?

656
00:35:41,944 --> 00:35:43,405
Have you forgotten to thank me?

657
00:35:45,731 --> 00:35:47,113
Thank you, Emperor

658
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:50,552
The ceremony will be next month on the 19th

659
00:35:50,552 --> 00:35:53,844
Since you and Hua concubine entered the same year

660
00:35:53,844 --> 00:35:56,079
you are an old hand in this inner court

661
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,889
you must help assist Hua concubine

662
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:02,211
and help the empress with the burden of governing the inner court

663
00:36:02,675 --> 00:36:04,843
I will do my best

664
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:06,287
and share the burden with the empress

665
00:36:06,472 --> 00:36:07,535
rise

666
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:10,816
congratulations on your joyous news

667
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:18,512
I have to go to He Nan to see the problem

668
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:22,303
The inner court will be managed by the queen

669
00:36:22,303 --> 00:36:24,782
Hua and Jing Concubine will assist her

670
00:36:25,689 --> 00:36:30,064
I will do my best as Empress

671
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:41,006
Madame

672
00:36:42,187 --> 00:36:43,678
Greetings little mistress

673
00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:47,923
I heard that you are to help Mei concubine until she is no long sick

674
00:36:47,923 --> 00:36:48,972
it must be hard on your part

675
00:36:49,386 --> 00:36:52,048
thank you

676
00:36:52,889 --> 00:36:55,125
She is much better now

677
00:37:02,532 --> 00:37:04,843
Do you feel better, older sister?

678
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:06,633
I feel a little better

679
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:07,506
Why is it so noisy outside?

680
00:37:07,506 --> 00:37:08,773
What's going on?

681
00:37:12,526 --> 00:37:14,474
The emperor made Jing Concubine into a Royal concubine

682
00:37:14,474 --> 00:37:16,602
THey came to congratulate her

683
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:19,845
now that you are better, you are a Gui Ren (honored person)

684
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:22,368
What's the difference?

685
00:37:22,368 --> 00:37:24,508
it's just a tittle

686
00:37:25,186 --> 00:37:26,330
You've been so sick and depressed

687
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,834
You've suffered so much

688
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:31,729
it's no wonder you feel wronged

689
00:37:32,391 --> 00:37:35,042
Even if I say I am innocent

690
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:35,964
will you believe it?

691
00:37:37,531 --> 00:37:38,694
Since you are well now

692
00:37:38,694 --> 00:37:40,756
you should get up and walk around

693
00:37:41,531 --> 00:37:44,842
I don't want to go out, I get annoyed when I see people

694
00:37:44,842 --> 00:37:47,909
it's so peaceful in here

695
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:53,700
Doctor wan is here

696
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,560
I should thank you, you cured her

697
00:37:56,935 --> 00:37:58,191
I dare not accept

698
00:37:58,191 --> 00:38:01,032
it's the collective effort of the royal doctors' office

699
00:38:01,032 --> 00:38:02,900
I was able to cure her due to their medicines

700
00:38:04,202 --> 00:38:05,505
You are so humble

701
00:38:05,505 --> 00:38:07,227
Everyone knows

702
00:38:07,227 --> 00:38:08,999
that you are skilled, why deny it?

703
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:17,763
someone should have announced your arrival

704
00:38:17,763 --> 00:38:20,937
my mesy appearance is so embaressing

705
00:38:21,395 --> 00:38:23,621
Sisiter even though you are sick you are beautiful

706
00:38:23,621 --> 00:38:25,666
Xi Shi had a pain of the heart

707
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:28,179
But Dong Shi still wanted to copy her

708
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:31,787
No matter if a beauty is sick or not she will always be beautiful

709
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:33,281
Also

710
00:38:33,281 --> 00:38:35,419
Wen doctor has taken care of you for so long

711
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:36,731
he is familiar with you

712
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,493
let's not care too much about etiquette

713
00:38:39,094 --> 00:38:42,858
yes doctor wen has been very good takin care of me

714
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:49,742
If Little mistress eats these light foods

715
00:38:49,742 --> 00:38:50,943
even if it is very simple

716
00:38:50,943 --> 00:38:53,007
it has no good nutritonal value

717
00:38:53,007 --> 00:38:55,563
why do I prescribe some foods

718
00:38:55,563 --> 00:38:59,160
I see that Wan concubined doesn't look good as well

719
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,986
why don't I order some stewed lamb meat dishes

720
00:39:02,986 --> 00:39:04,267
it will help with the blood circulation

721
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:05,606
thank you for your troubles

722
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,733
you can always make people go the extra mile for yo

723
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:12,639
don't you think so? doctor wen?

724
00:39:13,532 --> 00:39:15,313
This should be part of my job

725
00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:18,788
then I will go and order these foods

726
00:39:24,189 --> 00:39:26,098
You've spoke alot

727
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:27,772
you must be tired, go and sleep

728
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:33,106
you don;t look good as well, what's wrong?

729
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:36,555
nothing, i didn't get enough sleep that's all

730
00:39:37,357 --> 00:39:38,860
even though I live in a well

731
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,321
but it's not like I don't know what it's like on the outside

732
00:39:43,587 --> 00:39:46,584
Now that hua concubine has so much power

733
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:50,935
Hua concubine has power over the inner court now

734
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:56,376
All our efforts have gone to waste

735
00:39:56,376 --> 00:40:01,219
All our efforts have gone to waste

736
00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:05,511
