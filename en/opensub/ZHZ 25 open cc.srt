1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,904
<i> ~ Episode 25 ~</i>

2
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:06,855
The Internal Affairs Dept. is pretty good at their work

3
00:00:07,643 --> 00:00:10,545
They made this nail shield so grandiose and glorious

4
00:00:11,573 --> 00:00:13,905
How can they not put their all into their work when they're working for Niang Niang?

5
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:17,808
know that working hard for me

6
00:00:17,808 --> 00:00:19,312
is being cautious of me

7
00:00:19,927 --> 00:00:21,633
Position and name are not important

8
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:24,048
what's important is where the emperor's heart is

9
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:26,746
What if Emperor ordained the Fei of Respect?

10
00:00:27,323 --> 00:00:30,018
he still doesn't favor her

11
00:00:30,018 --> 00:00:33,467
And don't even get me started on the Empress. She's old and ugly.

12
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:36,050
Emperor's only caring about Empress Dowager's wishes

13
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:37,305
That's right

14
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:38,700
Even during Emperor's duke days,

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,622
he has been cold to the Empress

16
00:00:40,622 --> 00:00:43,200
it's even more evident now

17
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,482
Report to Niang Niang:

18
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:50,232
Doctor Jiang is here for regular visit

19
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:50,989
Send him in

20
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:51,605
Yes

21
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:57,462
Ten thousand wishes to Fei of Hua

22
00:00:57,979 --> 00:00:58,843
Get up!

23
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:01,358
the Imperial Doctor has worked hard

24
00:01:19,723 --> 00:01:22,606
Niang Niang, your precious body is well and everything is all right

25
00:01:22,706 --> 00:01:24,888
If I'm well, when can I get pregnant?

26
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:30,231
Lady Fucha is already pregnant

27
00:01:30,468 --> 00:01:32,841
Niang Niang's body hasn't fully recovered from your miscarriage four years ago

28
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:35,324
After careful adjustments and care, you will slowly recover

29
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:37,918
As for news of pregnancy, it will be only a matter of days

30
00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:40,830
During this time Niang Niang still needs to care for her body

31
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:46,108
Borrowing your good words, I hope that Heaven will grant my wish

32
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,957
Is everything well at the Imperial Hospital?

33
00:01:49,187 --> 00:01:51,143
Because of Niang Niang's immense fortune, everything has been well

34
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:53,104
I am able to have everything I have

35
00:01:53,104 --> 00:01:54,908
because of you two brother

36
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:57,156
Naturally, I won't mistreat you guys

37
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:00,232
Where the plague cure was found

38
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,666
is a secret between us

39
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:05,108
Be more cautious of your work now

40
00:02:05,753 --> 00:02:06,578
I understand

41
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:08,507
I was trying to save my life that day

42
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:10,276
so I had to use this method

43
00:02:10,276 --> 00:02:12,148
I ask for Niang Niang's forgiveness

44
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:15,292
As long as the goal is reached

45
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:19,782
why fuss about what methods and ways were employed?

46
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,780
Milord don't need to be worried

47
00:02:22,823 --> 00:02:24,720
Wen Shichu wasn't suspicious of anything, right?

48
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,017
What if he gets suspicious?

49
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:27,962
Though his medical skills stand out from the rest

50
00:02:27,962 --> 00:02:29,785
but his experience in the Imperial Hospital is shallow

51
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:31,723
He has no evidence or proof

52
00:02:31,723 --> 00:02:33,563
so he can only keep his mouth shut about this

53
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:37,260
That's good. You can leave now

54
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:48,332
Why is it that your expression is always sour after you visit Fei of Glory Niang Niang?

55
00:02:48,663 --> 00:02:49,470
You don't understand

56
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:50,943
What don't I understand?

57
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:54,446
In the Imperial Hospital us brothers have obtained much prestige

58
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:56,698
and we have Fei of Glory Niang Niang to back us up

59
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,983
It's only a matter of days before we reach our peak

60
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:02,621
the peak of our success?

61
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:06,124
That's only for those who know how to be humans and who values life

62
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:08,850
Guard your mouth and do your tasks well

63
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,814
If it doesn't affect you, pretend you don't know it

64
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:13,544
This is the way of survival in the palace

65
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:19,645
Courtier Concubines greet Empress Niang Niang

66
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:21,994
Ten thousand blessings and golden peace to the Empress

67
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,033
You guys may rise. Grant seats.

68
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:26,575
Thanks to Empress Niang Niang

69
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:31,421
Why isn't An Changzai here?

70
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:33,004
An sister's throat infection hasn't healed yet

71
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,331
The imperial doctor has cautioned her

72
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:35,927
to stay indoors in case she catches a cold

73
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:38,542
Thus she can't come greet Empress Niang Niang

74
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,939
An Changzai is weak physically

75
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:42,965
Right now the plague hasn't been cleared so it's best for her to not move around

76
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:45,030
Thanks for understanding Empress Niang Niang

77
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,607
Oh right, did the palace distribute the silvers?

78
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:50,277
They've all been distributed accordingly

79
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:52,086
The silver the Internal Affairs Department distributed

80
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:53,388
I've already seen the record book

81
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:56,270
Is Fei of Glory familiar with some of the listed items?

82
00:03:56,873 --> 00:04:00,457
Each individual in each palace has received the amount of silver ordained to them by the ancients (previous emperors)

83
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:02,041
there are definitely no loopholes

84
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:03,545
Did Fei of Respect go over it?

85
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:04,856
There's no need

86
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:07,250
Any records I went over never have loopholes

87
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,766
Besides, Fei of Respect is not familiar with financial matters

88
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:11,460
It would be a waste anyways to have her go over it

89
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:13,981
and she would delay the silver distribution

90
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:15,570
causing everyone to complain

91
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:17,061
Empress Niang Niang

92
00:04:17,061 --> 00:04:19,956
I admiit I am somewhat slow at reading account books

93
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:22,066
But I will certainly improve

94
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:23,429
and not delay anyone

95
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:28,040
Study to improve, how long will that take you?

96
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,593
If you were given time to improve

97
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:32,028
how many matters would be delayed?

98
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:34,337
It's hard for the talentless to conquer great tasks

99
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:35,944
they would only be dragging everyone down

100
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:37,826
and embarrass themselves in front of servants

101
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:39,985
that their superiors are stupid and useless

102
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:46,701
Lady Fucha, are you experiencing the pregnant syndroms?

103
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,107
When I wake up in the morning, I want to vomit

104
00:04:49,107 --> 00:04:51,862
After eating the three meals I want to throw up even more

105
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:53,323
It really is hard

106
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:55,624
If it's so hard then you should eat less

107
00:04:56,325 --> 00:05:01,110
If you make the Imperial Kitchen deliver food to you like flowing water

108
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,296
then of course you will eat and throw up, throw up and eat

109
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:04,551
and vomit endlessly

110
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:07,797
For which pregnant women is it not hard?

111
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:09,793
Right now your body's worth gold

112
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:11,911
even if you have to eat abalone ginseng wing stomach everyday

113
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,250
it would be alright

114
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,192
It's not often that the palace has good news of pregnancy

115
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:18,100
Everyone's eyes and thoughts

116
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,889
are now resting on your belly

117
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,594
Thanks for Empress Niang Niang's care. I will certainly engrave this in my heart

118
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,549
and not blame Fei of Glory Niang Niang for saying that I eat too much

119
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:29,437
The bitterness of being pregnant

120
00:05:29,437 --> 00:05:31,239
is something Niang Niang cannot expeience

121
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:33,983
I have also carried the dragon's seed inside me

122
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:36,519
even if it's gone, I've seen many pregnancies

123
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,491
Pregnant concubines act like they've gotten the grand prize and show it off to everyone

124
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:43,497
They really are little girls who haven't seen the world

125
00:05:43,913 --> 00:05:46,116
Alright, all of you should less

126
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:47,918
Lady Fucha

127
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,225
it would be nice if you have a prince inside

128
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,139
The emperor doesn't have many heirs

129
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,739
If you can have a son

130
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:55,991
it will be a matter of days before you are promoted to a Pin or a Fei

131
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,332
For the prince and for your own body

132
00:05:59,332 --> 00:06:01,143
you must take care of yourself

133
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,570
Yes

134
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,489
This is the new blue the Internal Affairs Department created

135
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:11,710
Emperor specifically instructed them before he left

136
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,594
to make it intricately for my use

137
00:06:15,737 --> 00:06:16,699
Yeah

138
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:18,807
Emperor said that since Mistress Fucha is pregnant

139
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:20,183
and that An Changzai has throat infection

140
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:23,139
all the scent powder from Palace of Everlasting Blessings is to used with great caution

141
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:26,271
It's best to avoid using musk and to use more tranquilizing scent powders

142
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:29,818
So all these scent powders have been previously examined by the imperial doctors

143
00:06:29,818 --> 00:06:31,600
they definitely will not hurt Mistress's pregnancy

144
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:33,805
Look at how fortunate you are

145
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:35,701
Emperor is so caring toward you

146
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,300
I do have good fortune

147
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,268
but that An Changzai nextdoor got throat infection

148
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,329
what a misfortune for her!

149
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:43,893
she is an unlucky woman who will take away my fortune

150
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:51,198
Baojuan, what are you so happy about?

151
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:54,781
Mistress, didn't you go to visit Chun Changzai?

152
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,652
how are you back so quickly?

153
00:06:57,513 --> 00:06:58,453
What did you go do?

154
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:00,465
Servant really didn't do anything

155
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:04,387
Reach out your hand, reach it out!

156
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:10,135
Why is so gray and dusty?

157
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:12,152
Scent dust?

158
00:07:13,912 --> 00:07:15,257
Servant really cannot stand

159
00:07:15,257 --> 00:07:16,649
to see Lady Fucha mistreat Mistress

160
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:19,251
Servant heard that scent dust mixed with horse urine

161
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:22,421
would cause a person misfortune if spilled at the base of their wall

162
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,895
Servant did it only because I couldn't stand her ways

163
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,492
You are crazy!

164
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:29,298
How can you believe such baseless rumors?

165
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:31,742
It's all Servant's fault

166
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,562
If Mistress is angry, please punish Servant only

167
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:36,103
Servant willingly accepts the punishments

168
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:40,464
If Mistress take Servant to go see Lady Fucha

169
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:43,340
servant will not involve your, Mistress

170
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:47,716
Get up

171
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:50,819
You are my closest servant

172
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,784
From the outsider's point of view, what you do is no different from what I do

173
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,273
Everyday I see her being so arrogant

174
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:02,953
I also want to see her less aggresive

175
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:05,675
You are just one step before me

176
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:07,723
Did what I wanted to do

177
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,042
Mistress

178
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,178
If the servant has been long with the Mistress

179
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:17,687
Mistress wishes are just servants' wishes

180
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,265
So no matter what you do or say now

181
00:08:23,265 --> 00:08:25,653
You did it only after thinking about what I would do

182
00:08:26,826 --> 00:08:28,437
Jian Qiu to the Empress

183
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:32,110
Liu Zhu to Lady Wan is also the same

184
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:35,362
Then mistress, did I do wrong?

185
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:38,069
How come?

186
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,964
This is what a royal servant is like

187
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:00,671
Blessings to Lady Wan

188
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:02,295
Sister why did you get out of bed?

189
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:04,089
Do you feel better now？

190
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:05,221
I am better

191
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:14,310
Precious's health is getting much better

192
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,268
But...heavy disease hurt your body

193
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:18,248
you still need to rest well

194
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:20,969
thank you, Imperial doctor Wen

195
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:25,628
It is really because of you I can still live

196
00:09:26,556 --> 00:09:30,546
Lady, I have something on my mind

197
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:32,001
that I always question

198
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:33,699
Speak...

199
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,051
Lady, do you not think

200
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:37,433
you caught the plague too suddenly

201
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:40,324
I remember that the plague

202
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:42,187
was first discovered in the palace of Fei of Glory

203
00:09:42,187 --> 00:09:44,435
followed by you, Lady

204
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:46,554
however, Lady was grounded then

205
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:49,868
and did not encounter any servants in the palace of the Fei of Glory

206
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:51,679
How come suddenly catching the plague?

207
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:57,639
You are saying. Someone tried to use the plague to murder me

208
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:02,564
I am only doubtful

209
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:04,427
Sister, recall carefully

210
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,685
Was there anything unusual?

211
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:26,857
Internal Affairs specifically ordered me

212
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:28,630
to send you a new tea set

213
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,874
The tea is already ready. Please have a sip, Mistress

214
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:39,470
Cai yue

215
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,270
Mistress, what is it?

216
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:45,306
Have you changed my tea set?

217
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,132
Yes, Mistress has caught the plague

218
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:49,295
So items you used

219
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:50,717
especially tea sets and bowls

220
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,102
were all shattered and buried

221
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:54,178
You can leave

222
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:55,186
Yes

223
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:01,860
I remember that the first two days before my illness

224
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:04,512
Zhou Ning Hai, from Fei of Glory's palace

225
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:06,086
sent me a tea set

226
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:09,023
and said Internal Affairs ordered him to replace my old ones

227
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:10,766
I saw that tea set

228
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:13,144
wasn't to the standard of Concubines

229
00:11:13,144 --> 00:11:15,515
I thought because I was grounded

230
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:19,671
It is not good to quarrel with him

231
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:21,906
The plague transmits fast

232
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:23,343
to avoid the transmission

233
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:25,400
the first rule is to not contact the patient

234
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,370
the second rule is to not use any item the patient touched

235
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,911
especially the same tea cup

236
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:32,539
Then the tea set Zhou Ning Hai delivered

237
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:35,198
was used by a patient with plague

238
00:11:35,882 --> 00:11:36,796
I'm afraid so

239
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,585
No, it must be!

240
00:11:40,607 --> 00:11:42,345
Fei of Glory wants me dead

241
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:44,319
this wasn't the first time

242
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,906
It was her.

243
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:50,550
It must be her!

244
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:52,902
Sister, don't get angered first. We still need evidence

245
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,602
I'm confused about another thing

246
00:11:58,377 --> 00:11:59,585
Jiang Cheng is good at gynecology

247
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:03,352
How did he all of a sudden

248
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:05,357
know out of his own expertise, and was good at treating plagues

249
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,459
If I say that the plague-treating prescription

250
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,202
is from me

251
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:11,934
Do you believe me, Mistress?

252
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,862
I do. You are able to

253
00:12:14,826 --> 00:12:15,943
But the prescription

254
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,936
how did they get hold of it?

255
00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:20,207
I have already thought of the prescription

256
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:23,461
But I still needed more time to think over a few ingredients

257
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:25,035
So I didn't dare to use this prescription

258
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,047
and put it inside my drawer in the Imperial Hospital

259
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:29,742
I assume that when I was taking care of Lady Hui

260
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:30,803
they took advantage of it, and stole the prescription

261
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,570
They probably added a few more ingredients too

262
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:38,028
But because they were not experts on plagues

263
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:40,581
Prescription is a little too acute

264
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:42,738
But the medicine I gave to Lady Hui

265
00:12:42,738 --> 00:12:44,044
was mild and good for the body

266
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:47,193
Since the Emperor already said they made huge contributions

267
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:50,068
even if you mention it

268
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:51,649
nobody will believe you

269
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:56,099
and will say you are too aggressive and just wants to claim your reward

270
00:13:00,168 --> 00:13:03,111
Be assured. I will know how to deal with this issue

271
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,982
What is fun with arranging the silk lines?

272
00:13:10,982 --> 00:13:12,820
You cannot cut it, and arranging it will only make it messier (from ancient Chinese poetry)

273
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,709
Now the days are longer

274
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,945
Arranging this can kill time

275
00:13:18,602 --> 00:13:20,954
You are so young, and you say you want to kill time

276
00:13:21,824 --> 00:13:23,983
Why not take more time to be with the Emperor

277
00:13:25,477 --> 00:13:26,502
It feels lonely in the palace

278
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:29,066
Being with Niang Niang makes my mind at ease

279
00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:32,556
You come to Jing Ren Palace more and more often recently

280
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:36,223
But less to Yu Xuan Palace to be with Lady Wan

281
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:37,417
and Chun Chang Zai

282
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,952
Empress Niang Niang, do you not like me to serve at your side?

283
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:45,451
You are smart and elegant. Of course I like you

284
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:48,228
But who does not like crowds?

285
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:51,487
How can you truly like to come here, the always silent Jing Ren palace?

286
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,713
Because it is usually quiet

287
00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:57,819
it can teach me how to endure loneliness

288
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:01,472
Empress Niang Niang, you are so graceful like the clouds at the mountain tops

289
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:03,490
I admire you

290
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,495
And I have chronic illness with my throat

291
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:08,517
It is not suitable for me to go to crowded places

292
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,054
What you mean by graceful and reserved

293
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:14,974
is caused by the silence and loneliness

294
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:18,815
people become so after enduring long silences

295
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,075
Sorry for not minding my own words. I did not mean this

296
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:28,561
Get up

297
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,824
Of course I know you did not mean this

298
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,717
There is no need for more explanations between you and me

299
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:36,416
Thank you, Empress Niang Niang

300
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:39,782
Oh right, I made a fragrant bag

301
00:14:40,437 --> 00:14:41,715
and want to give this to Niang Niang

302
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,177
I wish Niang Niang does not mind that I do not have exquisite hands

303
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:52,027
This fragrant bag is so special

304
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:57,162
The smell is also mild and full of grace

305
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,081
The materials I used are peony and flower Lan

306
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:01,122
with Chen Shui fragrance and pine leaves

307
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:04,243
It smells mild at first

308
00:15:04,975 --> 00:15:05,976
If only smelled long

309
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:07,565
can the supreme elegance of Mu Dan (peony)

310
00:15:07,565 --> 00:15:10,580
slowly radiate

311
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:13,295
The embroidery patterns are also my favorite

312
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:15,994
Phoenix surrounded by Mu Dan

313
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:18,318
If Niang Niang likes it, it is my only pleasure

314
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,624
Although the fragrance bag is great, it is a pity that

315
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:24,447
I usually don't use fragrances

316
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:27,842
Sorry I have not observed well

317
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:30,224
Every time I greet Niang Niang at the palace

318
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:33,998
I only know that your place is full of the sweet smells of flowers and fresh fruits

319
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:37,307
but have not noticed that Niang Niang doesn't like using fragrances

320
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,977
I am too careless

321
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:41,914
It is not that I do not like fragrance

322
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:43,893
but to remind you

323
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:47,576
that some fragrances, if not used properly, only hurt your health

324
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:50,875
I thank Niang Niang for your teachings

325
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:53,677
You know how to make fragrances

326
00:15:53,677 --> 00:15:55,667
then you should know what terrible things can be involved

327
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:01,905
It is spring now. Even the cats are courting

328
00:16:02,904 --> 00:16:04,257
All the other cats do is to moew to court

329
00:16:04,257 --> 00:16:07,744
But my cat, Song Zi, likes to throw itself at things

330
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:11,825
Cats are not easy to tame in springs

331
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:15,782
But cats like smells

332
00:16:15,782 --> 00:16:18,247
Cats will be tamed after they smell certain smells long enough

333
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,663
An Chang Zai knows the most about fragrances

334
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:23,068
No wonder you know about this trick

335
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:28,876
After I go back, I will definitely make this fragrance with care

336
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:31,584
then bring it here so that Song Zi can smell it

337
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:34,084
A few days of taming will do

338
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:35,519
That is great

339
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,596
The flowers at Jing Ren palace have all blossomed

340
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,527
I want to invite all the Concubines in the palace

341
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:42,009
to enjoy the beautiful spring together

342
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:44,299
Sure

343
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:54,273
It smells so good

344
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:56,344
Mistress, there are many flowers over there

345
00:17:00,597 --> 00:17:02,896
It is the warmest in Empress's palace

346
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,147
Flowers bloom the earliest and most vibrantly

347
00:17:06,097 --> 00:17:07,731
Jing Ren Palace has the greatest "soil power" (the unsensible power from soils that nurture plants)

348
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:09,742
But you get the biggest blessings

349
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:11,469
It has been 4 months already, right?

350
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:12,470
Yes, that right

351
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,553
The Imperial Doctor say, pregnancy will be stable after 4 months

352
00:17:16,553 --> 00:17:18,412
When I was pregnant with No.3 A Ge (son of emperor)

353
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,352
I had lots of early pregnancy symptoms

354
00:17:20,352 --> 00:17:23,549
My feet are too swollen to fit in my shoes

355
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,990
I see that you don't have such problems, that's great

356
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,467
I heard that when Fei of Qi was pregnant

357
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:31,568
No. 3 A Ge was strong and liked to tumble

358
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:34,319
that is why he is a bit more rushy now

359
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,163
The emperor needs to take extra care of him

360
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:40,384
Right, what you said is quite reasonable

361
00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:42,064
The rushy temper

362
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:44,222
can only be tolerated by Fei of Qi

363
00:17:44,222 --> 00:17:47,064
Fei of Glory is too spoiled

364
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:50,129
to go through the hardships of giving birth to children

365
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:52,224
Wish you are pregnant with a son

366
00:17:52,224 --> 00:17:54,151
If it is a daughter

367
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:56,825
what a waste to your arrogance now!

368
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:01,386
Now you are pregnant, you shouldn't stand for so long

369
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:03,026
Jian Qiu

370
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:03,814
Send Lady FuCha to sit down in the sheltered hall

371
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:05,703
then bring her a swan feathered cushion. Don't let her catch cold

372
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:10,012
Sure, Niang Niang

373
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:12,128
Thank you, Empress Niang Niang

374
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,548
Blessings to Fu Cha Sister

375
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,947
The make up of Fu Cha Sister is sweet as the fresh dew

376
00:18:29,947 --> 00:18:32,096
seems not to be what we normally use

377
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:35,382
Lady Wan, you have a sensitive nose

378
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:38,182
the Emperor specifically asked Internal Affairs to make this for me

379
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:41,042
it doesn't hurt the baby, and nurtures the skin

380
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,227
This must be something really good

381
00:18:44,818 --> 00:18:46,202
The Emperor takes so much care of Sister

382
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:48,217
If Lady Wan really likes it, I will give some to you then

383
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:51,988
The emperor specifically made it for Sister

384
00:18:51,988 --> 00:18:53,269
how can I be so shameless to take it?

385
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,862
That is true too

386
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:57,433
This shows the Emperor's kindness to and care for me

387
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:59,391
Lady Wan, you are so modest

388
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:02,193
I won't bother you to take the gift reluctantly

389
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:04,942
Given it is a kindness from the Emperor

390
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:06,732
it is best Lady you keep it

391
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:09,180
better to wax it and put it on the shrine

392
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,594
Now you apply it on your skin, and expose it under the sun and wind

393
00:19:12,594 --> 00:19:15,269
if you melted the Emperor's "kindness"

394
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:18,420
Sister, let's go

395
00:19:19,504 --> 00:19:20,880
Who hasn't been pregnant

396
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,322
I can't stand her arrogance

397
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:38,611
Lose your anger, Sister

398
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,307
Now she rides the top of the tide

399
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:42,068
why bother to get angry with her?

400
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:45,934
Ten thousand blessings and Golden Peace to Empress Niang Niang

401
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,677
Xin Chang Zai, what are you talking about?

402
00:19:48,442 --> 00:19:50,450
Sister was saying that it is a good weather today

403
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:53,189
Since the weather is so nice today

404
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:55,854
Why don't we take Song Zi out, Empress?

405
00:19:56,427 --> 00:19:58,535
What Fei of Qi loves most is the cat, Song Zi

406
00:19:58,535 --> 00:20:00,265
Always wants to huddle the cat when you come to my place

407
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,057
Just that Lady Wan is afraid of the cat

408
00:20:02,057 --> 00:20:03,486
But it's a good idea too

409
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:05,901
Jian Qiu, bring Song Zi out

410
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:07,640
Servant doesn't dare to take it

411
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,017
That cat is really heavy now

412
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:10,447
and is annoyed in the spring

413
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:12,319
I don't know where it went at this time

414
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:04,037
We were just talking about Song Zi

415
00:21:04,037 --> 00:21:05,102
and here it comes

416
00:21:06,044 --> 00:21:08,155
Empress has cared for it well

417
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:09,479
it's gotten bigger

418
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:11,783
People usually have cats or dogs,

419
00:21:11,783 --> 00:21:14,410
but Princess of Respects is different

420
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,801
In her glass bowl,

421
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:18,236
she kept a huge turtle

422
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:23,435
I just didn't want to spend too much time

423
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:25,943
It's quiet and easy to raise

424
00:21:25,943 --> 00:21:27,679
you can feed it anything

425
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,912
I'm clusmy and can't raise anything else

426
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:33,380
If Princess of Respects say you're clumsy,

427
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,003
then I don't know what to call myself

428
00:21:36,635 --> 00:21:38,479
The Pin of Respects hasn't been formally bestowed the title of Princess yet

429
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:41,189
Precious Smile are calling her Princess of Respects already

430
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:43,026
you're too eager

431
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,178
You'll have plenty of time later, what's the hurry?

432
00:21:47,992 --> 00:21:50,089
Princess of Glory, you're too serious

433
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,755
it doesn't matter if it's formal or not

434
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:54,380
As long as the Emperor agree

435
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,749
she is the Princess of Respects

436
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:56,947
Don't you agree?

437
00:21:57,236 --> 00:21:58,999
If it is, then it is. If it's not, then it's not.

438
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:02,147
If you are blessed, you're not afarid to wait

439
00:22:02,147 --> 00:22:03,815
If you're not,

440
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:07,888
you won't make it even if it was just seconds way

441
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:10,847
Today's already the 3rd

442
00:22:10,847 --> 00:22:13,263
another ten more days, it'll be the ceremony

443
00:22:13,263 --> 00:22:15,756
Princess of Respects, you should be prepared

444
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:16,958
Yes

445
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:21,233
Princess of Respects and Princess of Glory started serving the Emperor on the same day

446
00:22:21,888 --> 00:22:23,189
Not only are you conferred a Princess,

447
00:22:23,189 --> 00:22:26,157
you will also help Princess of Glory with the management of the six palaces

448
00:22:26,157 --> 00:22:29,282
It's your blessing to have someone assist you

449
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,316
I am even more blessed to be able to live so leisurely

450
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:36,925
Your Majesty has great fortunes

451
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:39,127
This peony flower has blossomed nicely

452
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:43,279
but pink is still an inferior colour

453
00:22:43,888 --> 00:22:45,518
it's unqualified for refined places

454
00:22:46,103 --> 00:22:47,423
Unlike this garden peony

455
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:51,948
it's not the king of flowers, but it's red and captivating

456
00:22:54,035 --> 00:22:55,794
Now this is a grand colour

457
00:22:57,271 --> 00:22:59,671
Pinks are always for concubines

458
00:23:00,392 --> 00:23:03,050
Only bright red and red are for main wives

459
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,174
Truthfully, if you're young

460
00:23:06,183 --> 00:23:09,268
who cares what colour flower you use?

461
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:17,484
How can she invert the superior and the inferior

462
00:23:20,428 --> 00:23:22,441
I learned a poem when I was young

463
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:24,368
it suits the situation now

464
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:27,059
I shall recite for the Empress and all the sisters

465
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:28,659
Go ahead

466
00:23:30,837 --> 00:23:32,832
The garden peony in the courtyard is bewitching but lack style

467
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:36,161
The lotus in the pond is clean but lack emotion

468
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:38,438
Only the peony is the true national beauty

469
00:23:38,438 --> 00:23:41,388
When it blossoms, it moves the capital

470
00:23:43,136 --> 00:23:45,652
What a line, "only the peony is the true national beauty"!

471
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:49,053
The superior and inferior is in the heart

472
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,040
No matter how red the garden peony is, it still lacks style

473
00:23:54,314 --> 00:23:56,784
It cannot be compared to the national beauty of peony

474
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:02,871
Princess of Glory, we came here to enjoy the flowers

475
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:04,788
why do you look so unhappy?

476
00:24:04,788 --> 00:24:07,630
Why ruin your mood by worrying too much?

477
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:17,786
Precious has enjoyed the flowers for too long, your makeup is coming off

478
00:24:30,686 --> 00:24:32,340
It's indeed the powders bestowed by the Emperor

479
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,838
it smells so nice

480
00:25:08,826 --> 00:25:09,705
What happened?

481
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:10,750
Young Mistress!

482
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,765
Call the Imperial Physicians!

483
00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:13,269
Young Mistress, are you okay?

484
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:14,294
Are you okay?

485
00:25:14,294 --> 00:25:15,663
It hurts

486
00:25:20,765 --> 00:25:21,865
Niang Niang, it hurts

487
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:23,064
Call the Imperial Physicians now!

488
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:25,244
Help Precious Fucha into the palace

489
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:29,661
Jie Jie, if you're hurt, I...

490
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,620
Is Fucha Jie Jie okay?

491
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,762
Help her into the palace, hurry

492
00:25:37,898 --> 00:25:39,240
Jie Jie, don't scare me!

493
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:46,641
How are you feeling?

494
00:25:48,158 --> 00:25:51,837
Empress, it hurts

495
00:25:53,248 --> 00:25:55,355
The Imperial physician will be here soon, don't worry

496
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:00,163
Your Servant is late, please forgive me

497
00:26:01,747 --> 00:26:02,780
It's good you're here

498
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,563
Imperial physician Zhang, hurry and go see Precious Fucha

499
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,382
Yes

500
00:26:18,388 --> 00:26:21,073
Reply to Your Majesty, after Young Mistress fell

501
00:26:21,073 --> 00:26:23,129
her pulse became unstable, and it shook the fetus

502
00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:24,672
and she was shocked

503
00:26:25,588 --> 00:26:26,558
Your servant suggests

504
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:28,805
she be transported back to her palace to rest

505
00:26:28,805 --> 00:26:31,279
Then I wiill write some prescriptions

506
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,262
and see if it will restore the fetus's vitals

507
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:36,904
Then go write the prescriptions now

508
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:38,326
Yes

509
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,020
Greetings to the Empress dowager

510
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:08,311
Greetings to the Empress dowager

511
00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:09,919
All rise

512
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,037
Thank you Empress dowager

513
00:27:11,414 --> 00:27:13,341
I came as soon as I heard the news

514
00:27:14,077 --> 00:27:15,383
How is Precious Fucha?

515
00:27:16,196 --> 00:27:17,507
The Imperial physician has prescribed medicine to stablize the fetus

516
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:20,204
It hurts

517
00:27:21,695 --> 00:27:22,807
Empress, Empress dowager

518
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,055
Precious Fucha is bleeding

519
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:36,869
It's useless now

520
00:27:43,544 --> 00:27:44,668
What happened?

521
00:27:48,015 --> 00:27:49,499
Empress dowager

522
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:51,491
How pitiful for Precious Fucha

523
00:27:51,491 --> 00:27:53,676
The Empress's cat went crazy

524
00:27:53,676 --> 00:27:55,363
and jumped on Precious

525
00:27:55,363 --> 00:27:57,970
Precious was hit and shocked

526
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,745
that's how it happened

527
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:00,788
Where is the animal?

528
00:28:00,788 --> 00:28:02,716
I've ordered them to catch it

529
00:28:04,145 --> 00:28:05,453
Whose pet was it?

530
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,792
I am to blame,

531
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:10,035
that animal is called Song Zi

532
00:28:10,035 --> 00:28:11,958
Princess of Regularity gave it to me

533
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:14,415
I was keeping it for fun

534
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:16,841
Song Zi is usually very tamed

535
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:18,477
But it went crazy today

536
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:20,437
it is really my fault

537
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:23,957
All rise

538
00:28:24,084 --> 00:28:25,050
Yes

539
00:28:27,383 --> 00:28:29,802
Hurry and send Precious Fucha back in a soft sedan chair

540
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:33,082
It's inconvenient to stay in the Empress's palace

541
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:35,936
Tell the Imperial physician to do his best

542
00:28:35,936 --> 00:28:37,517
and see if he can keep the Imperial child

543
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:41,542
Everything else, leave it to heaven

544
00:28:42,563 --> 00:28:43,338
Yes

545
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,005
What happened to Precious Smile?

546
00:28:49,668 --> 00:28:50,986
Precious Smile tried saving Precious Fucha

547
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:52,132
and fell too

548
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:53,392
Maybe she's hurt somewhere

549
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:56,238
Imperial physician, take a look at Precious Smile

550
00:28:56,578 --> 00:28:57,384
Yes

551
00:29:05,163 --> 00:29:08,471
Reply to Empress dowager, the wound on Young mistress's neck is superficial

552
00:29:08,471 --> 00:29:10,312
It will heal with some ointment

553
00:29:10,312 --> 00:29:11,869
But this arm

554
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:14,878
will have to be treated with care

555
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:17,685
Please take her pulse too

556
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:19,308
this will ease our worries

557
00:29:19,773 --> 00:29:22,721
Yes, let me take the pulse

558
00:29:42,018 --> 00:29:43,072
Congratulations, Young mistress

559
00:29:43,396 --> 00:29:44,553
What are you talking about?

560
00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:46,483
Wan Jie Jie's arm is hurt, and you are congratulating her?

561
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,761
Congratulations, Young mistress

562
00:29:47,761 --> 00:29:50,777
You are nearly two months pregnant

563
00:29:56,678 --> 00:29:57,816
That's wonderful

564
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:03,168
Don't move, don't move

565
00:30:03,544 --> 00:30:05,186
Sit down, sit down sit down

566
00:30:07,102 --> 00:30:08,005
Imperial physician Zhang

567
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:10,737
it is true that Precious Smile is pregnant?

568
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,951
Your Servant has been practicing medicine for several decades

569
00:30:12,951 --> 00:30:15,112
I am confident

570
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:18,236
Reply to Niang Niang, Precious Smile's body is frail

571
00:30:18,236 --> 00:30:21,595
and she also fell, so the fetus's a little unstable

572
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:23,683
Let me write a prescription

573
00:30:23,683 --> 00:30:25,504
for the Young mistress to use

574
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:28,219
If she get some rest, it won't be a problem

575
00:30:28,815 --> 00:30:30,441
Then please take care of her, Imperial physician Zhang

576
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:33,713
I will put Precious Smile and her baby

577
00:30:33,713 --> 00:30:35,382
in your hands

578
00:30:35,382 --> 00:30:37,874
Your servant will try his best

579
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,015
Imperial physician Zhang is very skilled, don't worry

580
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:47,460
Please look after at Precious Fucha for now

581
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:48,986
Hui Chun

582
00:30:49,201 --> 00:30:50,337
Your servant is here

583
00:30:50,337 --> 00:30:52,502
Send more Imperial physicians to come assist Imperial physician Zhang

584
00:30:53,173 --> 00:30:54,424
Yes, Niang Niang

585
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,505
Thank you for your attention, Your Majesty

586
00:30:57,505 --> 00:30:58,692
I can't thank you enough

587
00:30:59,431 --> 00:31:01,412
What a good time for the baby to come

588
00:31:02,217 --> 00:31:04,224
Precious Fucha's baby will probably be gone

589
00:31:04,224 --> 00:31:05,732
And yours came right after

590
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:07,631
What a fortune

591
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:10,920
What happened today was surprising

592
00:31:12,277 --> 00:31:14,633
But you're too careless, Precious Smile

593
00:31:14,633 --> 00:31:16,860
how can you not know you're pregnant?

594
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,601
You even tried to save her

595
00:31:18,601 --> 00:31:20,491
Luckily you're not hurt

596
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:23,111
If something happened

597
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:26,857
it's a big incident that affects the Royal lineage

598
00:31:27,338 --> 00:31:28,572
It's my mistake

599
00:31:29,507 --> 00:31:31,326
Everyone around you were also too careless

600
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:33,652
How can they be absent minded about

601
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:34,744
something as big as a pregnancy

602
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:36,635
If something had happened today

603
00:31:36,635 --> 00:31:38,905
I will banish them all to the Bureau of Cautious Punishment

604
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,394
Please don't be mad, Your Majesty

605
00:31:40,394 --> 00:31:41,538
It's not their fault

606
00:31:41,538 --> 00:31:42,928
I was careless myself

607
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:45,690
I thought the fatigue was caused by the spring season

608
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,024
I have always been unbalanced

609
00:31:48,024 --> 00:31:50,406
it's normal for my periods to come late

610
00:31:50,406 --> 00:31:53,873
And I noticed when the sisters were pregnant

611
00:31:53,873 --> 00:31:55,275
they felt sick and nauseous

612
00:31:55,275 --> 00:31:57,145
But I did not

613
00:31:57,863 --> 00:31:59,100
The signs of pregnancy

614
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,658
depends on your physique

615
00:32:00,658 --> 00:32:02,746
When I had Princess Wen Yi

616
00:32:02,746 --> 00:32:05,243
I only started getting morning sickness when I was four or five months pregnant

617
00:32:07,076 --> 00:32:09,643
Empress dowager, the Emperor does not have many offsprings

618
00:32:09,643 --> 00:32:12,587
Now that Precious Smile is pregnant

619
00:32:12,587 --> 00:32:15,523
it's really heaven sending blessings to Qing

620
00:32:17,177 --> 00:32:20,482
You have to be careful in the first three months

621
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:22,936
You must rest quietly

622
00:32:22,936 --> 00:32:25,111
you're hurt too

623
00:32:25,387 --> 00:32:27,096
Yes, thank you Empress Dowager

624
00:32:32,424 --> 00:32:33,605
Enough, stop looking

625
00:32:33,605 --> 00:32:35,833
The Imperial physician said it's just a superficial wound

626
00:32:37,851 --> 00:32:39,625
I wonder if it'll leave a scar

627
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,092
Even if it did, it's okay

628
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:44,283
Put some powders on and you won't see it

629
00:32:44,283 --> 00:32:46,468
As long as you're okay

630
00:32:47,496 --> 00:32:50,084
You're right, as long as the baby's okay

631
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:52,817
Liu Zhu, bring some water

632
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:53,672
Yes

633
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:55,620
Huan Bi, bring two good pillows

634
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,483
and let your mistress rest more comfortably

635
00:32:57,483 --> 00:32:58,031
Yes

636
00:32:58,031 --> 00:33:00,146
Jin Xi, go close the doors, don't let the wind in

637
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:01,051
Yes

638
00:33:01,051 --> 00:33:03,010
Xiao Yun Zi, bring a softer cloud silk cover

639
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:03,961
Yes

640
00:33:04,741 --> 00:33:07,345
No, I'm not that fragile

641
00:33:07,345 --> 00:33:08,823
it's too much trouble

642
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:09,979
Fine, fine

643
00:33:09,979 --> 00:33:12,373
I forgot how picky you are

644
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:13,725
You may go now

645
00:33:17,757 --> 00:33:18,880
You sent them all away

646
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,227
who will serve me now?

647
00:33:20,964 --> 00:33:22,315
I will, okay?

648
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:29,995
You're just getting better

649
00:33:29,995 --> 00:33:31,937
why did you came here in such a hurry

650
00:33:33,232 --> 00:33:35,635
Huan Er, I am really happy for you

651
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:38,101
But Precious Fucha just had a miscarriage today

652
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:40,001
and the Emperor's not back yet

653
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,985
I am really worry for you too

654
00:33:43,715 --> 00:33:45,463
I won't let anything happen to my baby

655
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:48,220
Of course you won't,

656
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,798
but neither did Precious Fucha

657
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,510
Let me tell you,

658
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,073
there are too many miscarriages in this harem

659
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,267
I asked the Imperial physician

660
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:59,820
he said Lingering Xin had a miscarriage

661
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,781
because she slipped and fell

662
00:34:01,781 --> 00:34:04,149
This time, Precious Fucha had an accident too

663
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:06,455
Don't you think

664
00:34:06,455 --> 00:34:11,440
these accidents might not be accidents after all?

665
00:34:14,623 --> 00:34:15,783
How is Precious Fucha?

666
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:18,053
She went back to Palace of Lasting Fortune

667
00:34:18,053 --> 00:34:20,556
I took a look, she's still unconscious

668
00:34:20,556 --> 00:34:22,879
The Imperial physicians are all there waiting

669
00:34:38,468 --> 00:34:40,627
Young mistress, let's go in. This is scary

670
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:42,194
What's so scary?

671
00:34:42,194 --> 00:34:43,855
It's all a mess

672
00:34:43,855 --> 00:34:46,406
we won't get any sleep tonight

673
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,069
It's really the month of March, the fragrance of flowers and grass

674
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:54,587
Even late at night, it's not in the least inferior

675
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,727
Young mistress, I did what you told me

676
00:34:57,727 --> 00:34:58,783
and opened the corner door

677
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:02,580
But, will Princess of Modesty really be here?

678
00:35:03,615 --> 00:35:05,214
Princess of Modesty is someone who keeps her promises

679
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:08,330
Since she sent words, she probably won't break her promise

680
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,508
Young mistress tried to save Precious Fucha today

681
00:35:13,508 --> 00:35:14,683
It really gave me a fright

682
00:35:14,683 --> 00:35:16,147
It was too dangerous

683
00:35:17,872 --> 00:35:21,473
You're not that close with Precious Fucha anyways,

684
00:35:21,473 --> 00:35:23,024
why bother?

685
00:35:23,177 --> 00:35:24,872
If I say someone pushed me,

686
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,461
will you believe me?

687
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:29,995
I suspects that person wanted

688
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:32,305
me to hit Precious Fucha's stomach

689
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,691
Then if Precious Fucha has a miscarriage,

690
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:36,484
I'll be the main culprit

691
00:35:37,312 --> 00:35:38,222
Two birds with one stone

692
00:35:39,649 --> 00:35:41,013
In the harem,

693
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,944
if you're pregnant, you'll become the target

694
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:46,152
Today, it's Precious Fucha

695
00:35:46,152 --> 00:35:48,973
Tomorrow, it might be you, Young mistress

696
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:53,354
There will be many who can't sleep tonight

697
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:54,828
Yes

698
00:35:54,828 --> 00:35:58,292
Those who couldn't sleep because of Precious Fucha's baby

699
00:35:58,292 --> 00:36:00,065
can now get a good night's rest

700
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:02,357
But when they think you

701
00:36:03,056 --> 00:36:04,784
they probably can't fall asleep again

702
00:36:08,612 --> 00:36:09,942
I called the Empress here so late

703
00:36:09,942 --> 00:36:12,107
I can't sleep

704
00:36:13,745 --> 00:36:15,123
Neither can I

705
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:17,153
just in time to keep you company

706
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,377
I heard that when Precious Fucha woke up

707
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:22,248
and know the baby's gone

708
00:36:22,248 --> 00:36:24,488
she started crying heavily

709
00:36:25,276 --> 00:36:28,943
She is upset, it will pass

710
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,317
You still didn't catch that animal?

711
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:35,576
I tried my best

712
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:41,589
I see you still need help for something so trivial

713
00:36:44,029 --> 00:36:44,931
Zhu Xi

714
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:46,421
Your servant is here

715
00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:49,679
Is it ready?

716
00:36:50,781 --> 00:36:51,389
Yes

717
00:36:54,854 --> 00:36:55,915
Bring it in

718
00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:07,834
Empress, take a close look

719
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,637
Precious Smile, take a look at this

720
00:37:58,369 --> 00:37:59,977
There's no powder in this box

721
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:02,285
but I can still smell it

722
00:38:03,442 --> 00:38:05,228
This is Precious Fucha's powders

723
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:10,082
I've also seen Precious Fucha's maid with this box

724
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,605
Did Niang Niang find this in the Empress's courtyard?

725
00:38:14,638 --> 00:38:15,541
That's right

726
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,573
Everyone was busy looking at you and Precious Fucha

727
00:38:19,198 --> 00:38:21,522
and I picked this up

728
00:38:22,325 --> 00:38:23,466
What does Niang Niang suspect?

729
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:27,748
I heard that Precious Fucha had a miscarriage

730
00:38:27,748 --> 00:38:29,797
because of a cat called Song Zi

731
00:38:29,797 --> 00:38:31,237
suddenly jumped out

732
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:33,450
Don't you think that's weird?

733
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:38,137
Of course, cats get a little irritable in Spring

734
00:38:39,038 --> 00:38:41,119
but Song Zi was trained

735
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,704
Why would it suddenly hurt someone?

736
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:47,070
And only jumped at Precious Fucha?

737
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:50,780
Maybe it was a coincidence

738
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:55,004
Look, you said it so hesitantly

739
00:38:55,846 --> 00:38:57,942
you probably don't believe it either

740
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,817
What Niang Niang is trying to say

741
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:04,459
How much powder can Precious Fucha use by herself?

742
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:05,432
Empress Dowager

743
00:39:05,432 --> 00:39:07,276
And you blame it on an animal?

744
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:10,220
I have eye problems

745
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,301
and you all treat me as if I'm blind!

746
00:39:13,587 --> 00:39:15,748
Luckily I am clear in my heart

747
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:20,419
This animal killed my biological grandson

748
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,340
Please forgive, Empress Dowager

749
00:39:28,815 --> 00:39:30,636
I've never been an Empress in my life

750
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,993
only when the late Emperor died, I became the Empress Dowager

751
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,036
So when the Emperor ascended the throne

752
00:39:38,036 --> 00:39:40,398
I made you the Empress

753
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:43,242
just so the throne of the Empress

754
00:39:43,242 --> 00:39:45,828
will remain in the hands of our family

755
00:39:48,362 --> 00:39:49,369
Remember

756
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:53,564
there are some things I can turn the blind eye

757
00:39:54,887 --> 00:39:58,454
but there are some things, I can't

758
00:40:03,574 --> 00:40:07,832
