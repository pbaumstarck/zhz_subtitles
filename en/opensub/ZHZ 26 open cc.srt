1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
The Legend of Zhen Huan <br> -Episode 26-

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,500
Fucha Guiren has seen such misfortune all because of her baby.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,700
She has now lost her baby...

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,700
while you're pregnant on the other hand.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,600
Thank you for the advice, <i>niangniang</i>.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,400
Babies are innocent. Every baby carries the effort of every parent.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,800
I just can't bear to see bad things happen.

8
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:31,516
Just take it as accumulating good fortune for your baby.

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,700
I thank Your Highness for your pity and care for my baby.

10
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:43,084
What are you doing? Quickly get up.

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,200
Since I've said so much, I might as well say something more.

12
00:00:49,278 --> 00:00:52,813
Cao Qinmo is even tougher to tackle than Hua Fei.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,900
She is patient with her cunning schemes

14
00:00:55,954 --> 00:00:59,079
For many a time, I've almost fallen into her traps.

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,100
If Hua Fei were to be described as a tiger,

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,400
Cao Qinmo would be the claw of the tiger.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,300
But,

18
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:09,110
as long as you know who wants to harm you, you can be more cautious and avoid it.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,900
I'm just afraid that you'd be harmed

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,900
Not knowing who your opponent is...<br> that's the most...

21
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,000
scary part.

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
<i>Niangniang</i>, why is it that you never seem to recover?

23
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:28,822
Would Your Highness like to meet an Imperial Doctor that I know?

24
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,200
It's alright.

25
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,217
It's just an old illness.

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,400
I'm really tired,

27
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:37,152
I need to get back right now.

28
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:40,426
Then let me get someone to escort Your Highness back.

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,400
This can't be known by the public.

30
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,000
Does the Emperor know about this?

31
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:51,881
I've sent someone already. I told him to report it in a proper manner.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,300
To prevent the Emperor from feeling sad,

33
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,000
report it slowly and mention more about Wan Guiren's pregnancy.

34
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,500
I hope that the Emperor would feel better

35
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,300
upon news of Wǎn <i>guìrén</i>'s pregnancy.

36
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,900
I was thinking of that too.

37
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,800
No matter how sad the Emperor is,

38
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:11,018
there's still Wǎn <i>guìrén</i>'s baby.

39
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,800
If not, there are still so many concubines that could

40
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:17,167
bear children for the Emperor.

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,000
Never mind that we could not save Fùchá <i>guìrén</i>'s baby,

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,500
With Wǎn <i>guìrén</i>'s baby,

43
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,800
There can be no mistakes!

44
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,000
Understood.

45
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,100
Your Imperial Highness

46
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:34,701
there's something else I have yet to report.

47
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,700
What is that?

48
00:02:37,652 --> 00:02:41,946
Huá <i>fēi</i> wants to hire an outside doctor for herself.

49
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,200
What makes her bring up this matter?

50
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,000
Huá <i>fēi</i> thinks that her inability to get

51
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,765
pregnant is due to the incapable Imperial Doctors.

52
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,600
So, she wanted to hire a doctor to have a look.

53
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,700
This is what Huá <i>fēi</i> requested.

54
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,100
I heard that is was Nian Gengyao's idea as well.

55
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,500
What do you think, Empress?

56
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,600
If news of this matter is spread outside,

57
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:07,187
people would view Ministry of Imperial Doctor in a bad light.

58
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,300
It's bad for their reputation.

59
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,100
It's a loss of honor for sure

60
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,900
But if we reject her request,

61
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,700
with her temperament,

62
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,800
she will ask again and again.

63
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,400
Forget it,

64
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:24,625
let her go ahead with it.

65
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,700
If he is really a good physician,

66
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,600
after examining Huá <i>fēi</i>,

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
let him take a look at Zhu-Xi.

68
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:34,633
By my side, she has grown old.

69
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,906
Of course there are times when the old feel unwell.

70
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,300
Yes.

71
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,700
If Sun <i>gugu</i> is not feeling well,

72
00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:43,589
it's convenient for him to examine her as well.

73
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,900
Huá <i>fēi</i> was right,

74
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:52,384
With these mediocre Imperial Physicians,

75
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,100
illness takes a longer time to recover

76
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,800
I'm exhausted

77
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:13,515
I need to rest

78
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,900
Madam is weak originally

79
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,700
How could your body take it

80
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:23,195
after working for such a long time?

81
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:28,441
If it wasn't due to unsettled matters

82
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,678
I would've thrown this body of mine a long time ago

83
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:38,213
You still didn't have to meet Wǎn <i>guìrén</i> in the middle of the night and exhaust yourself by speaking for so long.

84
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,900
Babies are innocent.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,200
The mothers are innocent too.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,100
The mothers are innocent too.

87
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:47,931
Naturally, I can't

88
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,700
let her be in danger without helping her.

89
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
It's just a pity that

90
00:04:55,924 --> 00:04:57,174
I will never be able

91
00:04:57,995 --> 00:05:00,826
to have my own baby in this life.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,800
Your Highness!!

93
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,800
Please, you have to stop. These sour cucumber are bad for stomach.

94
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,500
Madam,

95
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,500
please don't torture yourself

96
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,700
I've just vomitted

97
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,000
Song-Zhi, I've just vomited.

98
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:58,432
Aren't you happy for me?

99
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,800
Quickly bring the Imperial Doctor!

100
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,900
Your Highness

101
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,200
Fùchá <i>guìrén</i> was pregnant,

102
00:06:10,794 --> 00:06:12,739
so is Wǎn <i>guìrén</i> now.

103
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,500
Seems like everyone could get pregnant

104
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:20,504
But why can't I get pregnant?

105
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,900
Madam,

106
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:25,626
you are still young,

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,400
it's just a matter of time.

108
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,000
I was pregnant.

109
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,590
It was a baby boy.

110
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,300
It's all because of her.

111
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,900
The medicines are bitter. This barley soup helps in soothing the throat.

112
00:06:56,102 --> 00:06:57,686
You can get to sleep after taking this.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,300
Arrival of Huá <i>fēi</i>!

114
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,100
Huá <i>fēi</i>...

115
00:07:11,962 --> 00:07:12,596
Your Highness, Huá <i>fēi</i>...

116
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,000
Duān <i>fēi</i> is asleep. Please come tomorrow if you'd like to visit.

117
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Move aside!

118
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:21,757
Yes.

119
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,300
Hold her!

120
00:07:24,707 --> 00:07:25,270
Understood.

121
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:26,901
Your Highness! Your Highness!

122
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,300
Your Highness!

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,600
It's been so many years.

124
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:50,076
You stormed in with the same posture

125
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
every time when you were mad.

126
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,600
It's been many years.

127
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,000
Whenever I think of my unborn baby!

128
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,800
I just can't wait to tear you apart!

129
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,600
Tear me apart?

130
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,300
You've been doing it all these years, haven't you?

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,900
I wanted

132
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,600
I hate that I am unable to kill you with my own hands!

133
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,600
Sickness have clung on to me for so long

134
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:27,317
death seems to be a better choice to me.

135
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,500
Doesn't this make you happier than killing me?

136
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,400
Your misery could never make up for the pain

137
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:36,751
that I suffered for losing my son.

138
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:39,509
When the Emperor took the throne,

139
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:44,227
he granted you rank of consort and kept you alive.

140
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,100
How could I not hate you?

141
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,400
A cruel woman like you should've been

142
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:52,483
tortured to death.

143
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,100
If I am really such a great sinner,

144
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,600
the Emperor wouldn't have

145
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,600
let me lived til now.

146
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,900
The Emperor protects you because he trusts you.

147
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,400
But I will never believe you even if I die.

148
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,400
It was you who gave me the medicine.

149
00:09:12,102 --> 00:09:17,424
I believed in you then because you were such a peaceful person.

150
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,386
I didn't stop to think that you could be so cruel.

151
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:24,017
You killed my baby with that medicine!

152
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,300
My poor baby..

153
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:34,807
It was a formed baby that you killed so cold-heartedly!

154
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,200
Back then you jumped the gun and blamed everything on me.

155
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,100
Forcing me to drink the Saffron in the middle of the night.

156
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,000
You've lost a son. But I've lost the ability to get pregnant!

157
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,800
So what?

158
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:59,675
How I wish you'd have no descendants forever!

159
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,500
If you have any solid evidence,

160
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,800
you would have had me killed,

161
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,500
why would you still be here?

162
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,500
As long as you are still in this Imperial Palace,

163
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,400
I will never let you go.

164
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,900
Whether you forgive me or not,

165
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,700
I do not care.

166
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,200
I've resigned to my fate.

167
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,800
I've lost myself in your hand.

168
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,000
It's late already.

169
00:10:39,586 --> 00:10:41,029
There is nothing beneficial

170
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:43,082
in disturbing the Empress Dowager now.

171
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,500
Do you think I'll be afraid of it?

172
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,400
Of course you will.

173
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,300
If the Empress Dowager knew about it,

174
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:55,149
the Emperor would know about it too once he is back.

175
00:10:56,621 --> 00:11:00,019
You've been favored all these years.

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,600
You must be afraid to lose the trust of the Emperor.

177
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,200
You're making a fuss because

178
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,500
of Fùchá <i>guìrén</i> and Wǎn <i>guìrén</i> getting pregnant successively.

179
00:11:13,862 --> 00:11:16,708
You're jealous.

180
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,900
Now that you're making a ruckus,

181
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:22,945
Aren't you afraid that Emperor would

182
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,600
suspect you for Fùchá <i>guìrén</i>'s miscarriage

183
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,300
and Wǎn <i>guìrén</i>'s injury?

184
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,700
You could

185
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,632
take a good look by then

186
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
If Emperor cares more about you

187
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,300
or the future generation of the Royal Family.

188
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,100
Today's incident has nothing to do with me.

189
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:45,192
It doesn't matter at all.

190
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,000
The only opinion that matters is the Emperor's

191
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:53,429
Just like how you insisted that I killed your unborn baby

192
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,600
and wouldn't forgive me.

193
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,200
It's the same theory.

194
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,700
There's still a lot to come

195
00:12:04,116 --> 00:12:06,342
Just wait and see what's going to happen to you.

196
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,200
I'm going to watch you suffer through your life.

197
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:35,356
Transfer all allowance of Yanqing Hall to Ministry of Imperial Medicine from now onwards.Count it costs for her medicine

198
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:40,020
Tell the Laundry Department not to wash anything from her palace

199
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,900
No fresh foods are allowed in her palace. Everything is not allowed!

200
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,100
Please calm down. It's been this way all these years.

201
00:12:53,154 --> 00:12:56,808
Those Imperial Doctors are useless. Send a message to my brother tomorrow

202
00:12:56,823 --> 00:12:59,357
Empress Dowager has agreed on hiring an outside doctor

203
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:10,951
Heard that you are one of the best doctors within the region of Qinghai.

204
00:13:10,975 --> 00:13:16,218
It is rare for a servant to get to meet Madam. It is an honor for me too. For being able to serve you.

205
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:22,019
Eunuch is being modest. Qinghai is a stretch of barren land. I am just trying to earn a living.

206
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:26,087
How can I be compared to the Imperial Doctor?

207
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:28,687
I'm nothing compared to them

208
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:32,286
I know nothing about medicine. But Empress Dowager is kind and says that

209
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:36,817
It is tough for Doctor Chen to enter the capital. Of course you would want to exchange ideas with the Imperial Doctors.

210
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,483
So that you could help the others when you leave

211
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:43,618
-How kind of the Empress Dowager, it's an honor to the nation..

212
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:04,031
Heard that you are treating Huá <i>fēi</i>. These are the previous medical records of Huá <i>fēi</i>.

213
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,819
ever since she entered the palace. Take it, I hope it helps you.

214
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:12,023
Thank you Chief Doctor.

215
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:17,618
Huá <i>fēi</i> has a prestigious status. She was favored by Emperor the most

216
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:21,354
That is why we put in the extra effort for her.

217
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:26,020
There has been more than 20 experienced doctors, treating her in the past. <br> Exactly

218
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,351
General Nian reminded me to treat Huá <i>fēi</i> with my utmost care

219
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:33,552
before he left.

220
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,549
I'm feeling very uneasy. <br> Exactly

221
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:41,620
Good that I get to discuss with Imperial Doctor, or I would stumble my way through <br> That's right

222
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:49,416
You've been working under my brother back in Qinghai?

223
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,560
Yes.

224
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:59,286
How long has it been? <br> Ever since the day the General came to Qinghai

225
00:15:00,844 --> 00:15:05,685
Qinghai is a barren stretch of land. You have been working hard for my brother's health.

226
00:15:05,762 --> 00:15:08,350
Song-Zhi

227
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:13,021
Thank you.

228
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:17,826
These 100 taels seems little, but it's more than enough

229
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,430
to kill a person.

230
00:15:20,493 --> 00:15:24,819
I'd give you 10000 taels if you could take care of my health

231
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,953
I would give you 10000 taels too, if you don't.

232
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:33,352
That's for the expenses of your funeral

233
00:15:33,352 --> 00:15:37,218
Your servant will do my best, please spare me.

234
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,854
I'm just saying it to let you know

235
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:45,907
If you sincerely give your best effort,

236
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,752
I will, naturally, not treat you badly.

237
00:15:51,814 --> 00:15:55,685
How's my health? Any possibility for pregnancy?

238
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:57,367
Your Highness is fine.

239
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:03,025
Then why can't I get pregnant all this while?

240
00:16:05,617 --> 00:16:07,898
Could it be affected by a previous miscarriage?

241
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:10,902
It's been years since the miscarriage.

242
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:16,486
It shouldn't affect that much or else other Imperial Doctors

243
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,618
would've diagnosed it earlier on.

244
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:23,087
Pregnancy needs good timing

245
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:30,621
and opportunity. Pardon me for my words. Was Your Hihness eager for kids all this while?

246
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,218
Of course. <br> Exactly.

247
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:37,487
Things like this can't be rushed

248
00:16:37,492 --> 00:16:43,016
Urging it will only cause delay. Your Highness needs to lighten up. <i>(be patient)</i>

249
00:16:43,031 --> 00:16:45,416
Perhaps there'd be chances in it.

250
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:47,551
You mean

251
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:50,296
Sense of urge in mood will make it tough

252
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:56,175
You mean there's still a chance for me to get pregnant?

253
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:59,487
It's just the matter of timing.

254
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:10,220
Timing is crucial, same goes to you

255
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,108
Bring me some good medicine for pregnancy

256
00:17:14,108 --> 00:17:15,683
Yes

257
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:21,550
Keep the money. I'll send another 2000 taels of silver to your estate later on

258
00:17:23,965 --> 00:17:25,819
Thank you

259
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:30,620
Excused <br> Thank you

260
00:17:34,643 --> 00:17:41,422
What's the matter with you?The weather is good.Why'd you sweat this much after coming from Palace of Supporting Earth?

261
00:17:41,456 --> 00:17:46,148
I'm ashamed. I was intimidated

262
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:49,420
by the environment of the Imperial Palace.

263
00:17:49,492 --> 00:17:53,480
Please take a look at Empress Dowager's servant if you are not in a hurry.

264
00:17:53,512 --> 00:17:56,085
Of course, please lead the way

265
00:18:05,455 --> 00:18:09,111
How is my illness?

266
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:14,759
You are fine, there is nothing wrong

267
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:22,216
The Imperial Doctor said that my illness takes a long effort to recover.

268
00:18:25,124 --> 00:18:29,223
When everyone around said that the person is ill

269
00:18:29,283 --> 00:18:33,048
While you go against it alone

270
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:35,283
What do you think will happen?

271
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:39,359
In contrast, a person is ill

272
00:18:39,427 --> 00:18:44,819
But not one dares to say it out loud. However, you notice and tell everything.

273
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:46,616
What do you think will happen?

274
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,020
Then people will think that I am a crazy man.

275
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:55,827
Yes, a reputable doctor would be thought of as a maniac then.

276
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,600
But there are other Imperial Doctors besides me. What if it was said by others?

277
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,500
That is impossible...

278
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:13,100
..ever. Everyone in the Ministry of Imperial Doctor shares the same thought.

279
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:19,647
I have the exact thought as them then.

280
00:19:34,283 --> 00:19:38,016
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

281
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,800
You're awake.

282
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,800
When did Your Majesty come back?

283
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,900
I had no idea at all

284
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,900
I was at Hénán when I heard of the incident of you and Fùchá <i>guìrén</i>.

285
00:19:51,952 --> 00:19:54,554
It bothers me a lot.

286
00:19:54,641 --> 00:19:57,086
So I came back once I got things settled.

287
00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:00,132
Your Majesty must be tired, you should've

288
00:20:00,219 --> 00:20:02,657
gone back to the Hall of Mental Cultivation to get some rest.

289
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,000
I wanted to take a look at you.

290
00:20:06,391 --> 00:20:09,976
Fùchá <i>guìrén</i>'s baby is gone

291
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:15,085
I've lost yet another baby. Why?

292
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,331
Why can't my children survive?

293
00:20:18,353 --> 00:20:21,630
Your Majesty you must be tired

294
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:24,355
Please take some rest here.

295
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:31,094
You must give birth to the baby.

296
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:35,953
I will love and care for him

297
00:20:40,353 --> 00:20:45,571
Your Majesty, please don't look at me. I'm injured and look awful.

298
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:54,473
It's alright, Imperial Doctor will cure you for sure.

299
00:20:57,417 --> 00:21:00,753
How is your arm? <br> It's fine.

300
00:21:00,804 --> 00:21:03,737
How foolish.

301
00:21:03,752 --> 00:21:08,149
Even if you weren't pregnant, trying to save Fùchá <i>guìrén</i>...

302
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:11,618
What if you injured yourself?

303
00:21:11,695 --> 00:21:16,322
It wasn't to save her, it was to save Your Majesty's baby.

304
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:19,716
She can never be compared to you

305
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:24,094
even if she's pregnant.

306
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:34,560
I know that both you and your father suffered due to Huá <i>fēi</i>'s incident.

307
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:39,520
Don't worry, I won't make you sad anymore.

308
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:48,607
Emotions can't be controlled, It's enough for Your Majesty to have such thoughts

309
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:57,416
Now that your father holds the position of a supervisor, it's more convenient to handle certain affairs.

310
00:21:59,737 --> 00:22:05,889
I've informed the Empress about granting you the rank of Concubine on the same day as Consort Jing.

311
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:10,559
I will never let you suffer anymore.

312
00:22:10,623 --> 00:22:13,152
I'm not suffering at all

313
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:19,958
When everything is settled, our baby will be born by then.

314
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:26,418
I'll grant you the rank of Consort and get you another place to stay by then.

315
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:31,632
The House of Broken Jade is good enough already. I care nothing about rankings.

316
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:38,378
I just want to live a normal life with Your Majesty and our baby.

317
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:44,760
Hui-Chun <br> Eunuch Su is here.

318
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,045
Did you come here to pass the royal order?

319
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,083
It's not even evening yet

320
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:51,268
Is the Empress inside?

321
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,819
Yes, I will pass on your words. <br> Please

322
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:02,755
Your Highness, Eunuch Su is here

323
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:07,723
We were talking about how Emperor went to other's palace once coming back.

324
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,442
Now that Emperor wants to accompany Your Highness, Emperor still cares for Your Highness the most.

325
00:23:11,485 --> 00:23:17,433
It is the 15th of the month,the Emperor must've missed Your Highness a lot.That's why he let Eunuch Wu to pass the order

326
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:20,438
Enough of words, quickly bring him in.

327
00:23:20,438 --> 00:23:21,487
Yes

328
00:23:23,344 --> 00:23:24,894
This way, Eunuch Su

329
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:29,748
Greetings to your Highness

330
00:23:29,762 --> 00:23:34,558
Excused. What brings you here?

331
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:39,226
Your servant is here to pass the royal order. Emperor is not coming to the Palace of Great Benevolence tonight.

332
00:23:42,178 --> 00:23:45,830
The Emperor would come to Empress' palace on every 15th of the month.

333
00:23:45,895 --> 00:23:48,629
What's the matter now?

334
00:23:48,723 --> 00:23:54,265
Did Huá <i>fēi</i> invite the Emperor for dinner or is the Emperor not feeling well?

335
00:23:54,369 --> 00:24:01,226
Emperor said that Wǎn <i>guìrén</i> is pregnant. So he went to visit her once the official matters were settled.

336
00:24:01,294 --> 00:24:04,465
Your Highness, please get some rest.

337
00:24:04,494 --> 00:24:10,503
That's normal. Wǎn <i>guìrén</i> is soft and detailed.

338
00:24:10,557 --> 00:24:13,764
Of course His Majestey would love to accompany her.

339
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:19,634
– Huichun, <br> – Yes

340
00:24:19,755 --> 00:24:25,229
– Pick up two Nephrite Jade Ruyi from the store room and send them to Wǎn <i>guìrén</i> later on. <br> – Understood

341
00:24:27,222 --> 00:24:30,154
Your servant takes his leave now then.

342
00:24:30,154 --> 00:24:32,484
Go ahead

343
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:47,262
It's still early. Your Majesty,

344
00:24:47,262 --> 00:24:49,485
please proceed to the Empress's Palace.

345
00:24:49,552 --> 00:24:51,640
It's alright

346
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:58,106
Your Majesty shouldn't neglect Empress just because of me.

347
00:24:59,753 --> 00:25:03,302
I want to be with the one I love no matter what.

348
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:06,570
Empress treats me really well.

349
00:25:06,617 --> 00:25:09,827
I can't bear to let down Empress.

350
00:25:11,754 --> 00:25:16,912
I'll accompany Empress for meals tomorrow then.

351
00:25:58,728 --> 00:26:02,293
Your Majesty

352
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,687
It's sour

353
00:26:09,774 --> 00:26:13,303
I had no idea that it is sour. I'll keep it aside.

354
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,149
It's really sour, don't throw it away. Send it to Wǎn <i>guìrén</i>.

355
00:26:18,187 --> 00:26:21,435
Now that she likes to eat sour stuff

356
00:26:21,486 --> 00:26:26,064
It's an auspicious sign.

357
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:32,754
Now that Fùchá <i>guìrén</i> had a miscarriage and Wǎn <i>guìrén</i> got pregnant, Empress must take good care of them.

358
00:26:32,822 --> 00:26:37,550
Of course, precautions must be taken since it's Wǎn <i>guìrén</i>'s first pregnancy

359
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:42,093
Be careful so that Chun-Yuan's incident won't reoccur.

360
00:26:45,092 --> 00:26:48,488
That was a tragedy, I will never let such an incident to reoccur.

361
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,812
In my opinion, precaution is necessary

362
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:58,043
beside that, Lady Fuca's incident

363
00:26:58,087 --> 00:26:59,851
It's my oversight on it.

364
00:26:59,887 --> 00:27:03,634
Be more careful and take precautions

365
00:27:03,737 --> 00:27:07,727
Take note that cats are no longer allowed in the palace. <br> -Understood

366
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:13,154
Besides, regarding the granting of Wǎn <i>guìrén</i>, please manage it with care.

367
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:15,363
I will take care of it

368
00:27:19,418 --> 00:27:23,511
The day of granting ceremony is near. How are things going?

369
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:28,888
Wǎn <i>guìrén</i> ranks with Hierarchy of Concubines. It's a must to perform a ritual during the ceremony.

370
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:34,236
Perhaps it's a little bit of a rush, since the time given was limited.

371
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:40,897
I'll follow the orders given by Empress Dowager and Empress

372
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:45,564
Be seated. I know that you're being mature

373
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:51,486
Although it's a bit of a rush. But we can't lack on ritual etiquettes

374
00:27:51,486 --> 00:27:54,620
I've got everything settled, Your Highness

375
00:27:54,747 --> 00:27:58,791
It's just that Wǎn <i>guìrén</i>'s formal attire cannot be cone in time,

376
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,900
So I asked the Ministry of Ritual to alter the previous attire of Jìng <i>fēi</i>

377
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,500
It's proper and expedient

378
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:12,222
You did a good job on this

379
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:18,754
– Chunmao <br> – Yes

380
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,100
This hairpin looks familiar

381
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,802
It looks like the one from when Huì <i>guìrén</i> was pregnant,

382
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,200
Your Imperial Highness bestowed it upon her

383
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:38,619
You have good sights. Back then Emperor smashed it with rage.

384
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,000
Caused the break on this hairpin.

385
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,900
Now that the gemstone has been reattached,

386
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I shall grant this Ruyi <br> Hairpin of Pure Gold

387
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,400
to you

388
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,600
Come here

389
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,800
It looks really good

390
00:29:00,325 --> 00:29:03,060
Huì <i>guìrén</i> didn't get the chance to put this on

391
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,600
You must keep this virtue of yours and contribute to future generations of the Royal Family.

392
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,300
contribute to the future generation of the Royal Family

393
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,200
Thank you.

394
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:19,484
What are these?

395
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,400
These are all granted by Emperor

396
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,418
This is Agar Cream

397
00:29:26,418 --> 00:29:28,300
I heard it's good for healing scars

398
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,900
This is Jade Powder that helps

399
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,400
in removing blood condensation

400
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,300
Emperor granted a lot <br> of medicines like this

401
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,900
The scratches aren't that bad

402
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,000
But it's startling just by looking at it

403
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,570
Miss has to be more careful

404
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,800
from now onwards

405
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,400
Your servant will take care of <br> of miss' daily meals

406
00:30:00,414 --> 00:30:02,820
Emperor has transferred a royal cook <br> from the Royal Kitchen

407
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:06,221
to specially take care of miss' meals. Others have no rights to interrupt.

408
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,300
Doctor Zhang will take care of Miss's medicine from today onwards

409
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,400
Doctor Zhang is reliable <br> There shouldn't be any error

410
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,000
Noble Consort, Lady An is here <br> Quickly bring her in

411
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,700
Yes

412
00:30:30,694 --> 00:30:32,507
Sister

413
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,100
Pardon me. With such condition

414
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,900
With such a condition <br> I really shouldn't have come out

415
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,400
What's wrong with your throat?

416
00:30:43,157 --> 00:30:44,685
Have a seat

417
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:46,492
The coughing is not getting any better

418
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It affects the throat I guess

419
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,400
Why didn't the imperial Doctor <br> give you proper treatment?

420
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,700
Doctor dares not use strong prescription since I'm weak

421
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:01,977
I forced myself to accompany Empress back then.

422
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:04,308
I got a shock because of Fùchá <i>guìrén</i>'s incident

423
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,760
It affected the illness in the end

424
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,300
That's way I haven't visited you these days <br> to congratulate you

425
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:14,175
These are small matters <br> Your health is the only thing that matters

426
00:31:14,235 --> 00:31:16,161
Does the Emperor know about this?

427
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,918
Emperor summoned me to <br> Hall of Mental Cultivation when he's back

428
00:31:22,024 --> 00:31:24,558
But I can't sing at all

429
00:31:24,651 --> 00:31:28,561
Emperor told me to get some rest

430
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:30,226
and never summoned me since then

431
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:35,299
When did this happen? I had no idea at all..

432
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,428
It's not something worth mentioning <br> Of course others wouldn't know

433
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,178
I've been complaining too much that I <br> almost forgot the purpose of coming here

434
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,200
How's your wound?

435
00:31:50,293 --> 00:31:51,775
It's getting better

436
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,766
Doctor was here for an examination

437
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,100
Emperor even granted me medicine

438
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:57,651
it's should be fine after some rest

439
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,000
It's good that Emperor <br> granted you medicine

440
00:32:01,192 --> 00:32:03,447
But you can't simply use any medicine

441
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,500
since your pregnant

442
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:09,633
Besides these medicines you were granted are all imported

443
00:32:09,703 --> 00:32:12,965
It might not suit us well <br> Don't you think so?

444
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,100
Your right

445
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:22,800
This healing cream is <br> a tradition of my family

446
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,698
Back in those years,

447
00:32:24,698 --> 00:32:28,985
When wife of Sun He, Lady Deng's face was hurt by a Jade Ruyi <br> The wound recovers just by using this

448
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,300
This cream contains Plum Blossom and Pearl Powder that helps in improving complexion

449
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:38,062
Gelatine and honey that nourishes the skin

450
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,000
Jade grits and Amber resin that helps in <br> healing wounds

451
00:32:42,151 --> 00:32:45,459
The marrow of white otter <br> that helps in removing

452
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:47,794
scar is the most precious ingredients

453
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,300
The other ingredients sound good

454
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,200
But marrow of white otter is really rare

455
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,100
Perhaps it could hardly <br> be seen even in the palace

456
00:32:54,229 --> 00:32:55,129
That's right

457
00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:58,504
White otter only exist within Fuchun River

458
00:32:58,504 --> 00:33:01,225
The marrow can only be <br>

459
00:33:01,225 --> 00:33:03,167
or dead otter in caves

460
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,583
Freshness of the marrow is the crucial point

461
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:11,600
The effect of stale marrow is nothing <br> compared to fresh marrow

462
00:33:11,764 --> 00:33:13,402
It smells good

463
00:33:13,402 --> 00:33:15,233
I wanted to use perfume originally

464
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:18,439
But <i>jiejie</i>, due to your pregnancy, you should avoid using perfume.

465
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,489
So I used flowers to adjust the fragrance

466
00:33:21,489 --> 00:33:24,300
so that <i>jiějie</i> wouldn't feel uncomfortable with it

467
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,900
It's good but it's too precious

468
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,100
I can't accept this

469
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,000
It's alright

470
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,800
I'd feel better once your wound recovers

471
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,586
Besides, <i>jiějie</i>, you have injuries on your neck

472
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,200
Now that there's dust <br> and pollen everywhere

473
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,200
It's bad if you accidentally got infected

474
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,500
Besides, this healing cream can't be exposed

475
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,744
Please remember to cover up your wound

476
00:33:54,744 --> 00:33:56,378
when your heading outside

477
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,800
Your so detailed. I have no idea how to my appreciation.

478
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:06,508
Have a try

479
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:13,512
I heard that sister's mother is allowed to enter the

480
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,300
Palace when it's about time to give birth

481
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,300
Really?

482
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,000
Yes, there'd be orders from Emperor

483
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,500
by the 8th month of pregnancy

484
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,154
You seem carefree all the time.

485
00:34:28,154 --> 00:34:30,100
What's the matter?

486
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,200
It's been a while since I seen my mother

487
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,500
But <i>jiějie</i> could get to meet your mother soon.

488
00:34:38,194 --> 00:34:39,023
How nice!

489
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,200
You're the youngest daughter in the family.

490
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,200
You must miss your family a lot since

491
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,022
you've not meet them since your entering the palace.

492
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,400
It's alright your mother would be happy once

493
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,500
knowing that Miss is living a good life here.

494
00:34:56,569 --> 00:34:59,647
Besides, outside food can't be

495
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:01,261
compared to those in the palace isn't it?

496
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,800
These are freshly baked corn cakes with milk it tastes best when it's hot

497
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,100
It tastes good!

498
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:21,371
How admirable, you could get rid of all the problems in the world once there's food.

499
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:27,231
Your mindset is like a pond of pure water.

500
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,500
I care nothing about pure water. I'll be happy once there's food!

501
00:35:31,634 --> 00:35:36,348
Yu-Er said that you liked corn cakes. So I told the kitchen to per pare some for you.

502
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,372
I even added in some milk, so that it's more crispy.

503
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:41,893
This taste so much better than these at my place.

504
00:35:41,948 --> 00:35:44,707
I'll get the kitchen to make it for you everyday. If you like?

505
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:47,298
But only one, nothing more than that

506
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:55,311
Wang Jie Jie, do you really have a kid in your stomach?

507
00:35:55,478 --> 00:35:56,795
Yes.

508
00:35:56,795 --> 00:35:59,311
But the kid is still very small.

509
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:01,596
He doesn't even have hands or legs yet.

510
00:36:01,631 --> 00:36:03,615
Wow! That is small!

511
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,700
I'll make him your nephew, if you like?

512
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,600
I could be his auntie for real?

513
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,000
Alright, this is my present.

514
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,000
Not that I can run away after taking your present.

515
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,500
Look how nice your Aunt is. Giving a present before you're born.

516
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,703
Little baby, quickly grow up.

517
00:36:37,703 --> 00:36:41,900
When you've grown up I'll feed you the most delicious foods in the world

518
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:47,697
Plum Blossom Cake, Glutinous Rice Cake, Bea Paste Roll, and Lychee Dessert.

519
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:50,032
I will give you everything!

520
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,800
You'll be a chubby baby for sure

521
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,700
Besides, your Aunt will give birth to a lot of babies to accompany you

522
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,614
Are you happy?

523
00:36:58,614 --> 00:37:00,900
Jie Jie is teasing me again

524
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,800
Lady Chun runs really fast. Now you see her, now you don't.

525
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:16,100
Jie Jie, what about me giving birth to eight kids to accompany your baby?

526
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,700
Enough, it's not like we could take care of it

527
00:37:33,638 --> 00:37:38,874
Niang Niang, both Doctor Jiang's came to examine you earlier on

528
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:43,605
Knowing that it's not proper timing since Emperor is coming

529
00:37:43,737 --> 00:37:46,683
they'd come again in the evening

530
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,400
Right!

531
00:37:50,189 --> 00:37:54,100
That woman is pregnant and can't serve at night. Yet the Emperor still went over to see her.

532
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,800
I'll tell Doctor Jiang to remind Emperor of it

533
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,697
Although Precious Wan is pregnant

534
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,700
But Lady Chun, is taking all the advantages now.

535
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,900
Such a cheap act, her playing innocent to seduce Emperor

536
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,500
Niang Niang, need not get angry she's just a young brat.

537
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:21,889
She's usually blunt with her words. You could use that as an excuse to get rid of her in the future

538
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:25,163
You could use that as an excuse to get rid of her in the future.

539
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,595
Aunt has been serving in the palace for years

540
00:38:31,595 --> 00:38:34,700
It's a blessings to me that maiden is willing to bun my hair for the ceremony.

541
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,300
Your forelock is really high

542
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,300
I've been serving in the palace for years. Your forelock is the highest among all that I've served.

543
00:38:47,755 --> 00:38:50,975
Now that your pregnant

544
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,200
It's a bliss that can't be compared to others

545
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,300
Everyone in the palace knows that high forelock carries sign of good fortune

546
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,000
You look like one that has good fortune

547
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,300
Oh, it's heavy!

548
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,800
Now that you are Wǎn <i>pín</i>, you find this new headpiece heavy,

549
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,000
What will you say when you become a <i>guìfēi</i>?

550
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,100
Don't spread nonsense!

551
00:39:12,345 --> 00:39:14,002
Liuzhu has a point.

552
00:39:14,094 --> 00:39:17,232
If you were to give birth to a baby prince

553
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:20,994
It would be outrageous if you did not become a <i>guìfēi</i>!

554
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,218
Jing Fei née Feng and Wan Pin née Zhen...

555
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,600
May Heaven guide you in your new positions.

556
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,693
Henceforth, you shall keep the virtue of harmony.

557
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,100
With diligence, may you bear many heirs.

558
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,800
We consorts shall follow Your Highness' guidance with gratitude.
