00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,375
The Legend of Zhen Huan
Episode 27

2
00:00:06,217 --> 00:00:09,687
She is now pregnant and has not recovered from her injuries yet.

3
00:00:09,712 --> 00:00:11,622
She is sleeping on the bed.

4
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:13,560
Didn't you hear what the doctor said?

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,840
Our head master is pregnant.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,287
That will be against the rules.

7
00:00:17,287 --> 00:00:20,505
Its really kind of the emperor to visit her everyday.

8
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:23,921
Indeed so, our young mistress is highly regarded by his majesty.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,320
I'll worry about this.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,200
I'm afraid that the baby would be a princess

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,488
then his majesty will be delighted.

12
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:30,560
Don't spout rubbish.

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,683
If your young mistress were to give birth, it would be a prince. There's no use in a princess.

14
00:00:34,683 --> 00:00:35,960
Are you trying to curse her?

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,300
Prince prince prince!

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,880
Of course it will be a prince!

17
00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:41,040
Concubine,

18
00:00:41,146 --> 00:00:43,113
His Majesty is here, His Majesty is here!

19
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:44,756
Understood.

20
00:00:44,824 --> 00:00:47,016
Mistress, its best you that you greet him.

21
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:51,882
His majesty has arrived.

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,000
Greetings

23
00:00:58,149 --> 00:00:59,553
your majesty.<br> Rise.

24
00:01:02,747 --> 00:01:04,686
Have you taken your medicine? <br> Are you feeling better?

25
00:01:04,747 --> 00:01:05,689
In...

26
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,760
Much thanks for your concern, your majesty. <br> I just feel slightly tired,

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,479
the doctor advices to stay in bed.

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's sit and talk.

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,440
From what I see,

30
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,800
you look more alert.

31
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:32,399
Much thanks for your concern.

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,000
Its all thanks to Doctor Wen.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,600
Mei Er,

34
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:48,999
Its my fault

35
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:51,082
for the things in the past.

36
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:55,414
Your majesty is the Son of Heaven; how can the Son of Heaven be wrong?

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,900
When you've full recovered,

38
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,599
I will get the board of internal affairs to hang up your green name plate.

39
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,800
I will be leaving now.

40
00:02:14,414 --> 00:02:15,496
Yes.

41
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:22,621
Safe journeys your majesty.

42
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:25,683
Departure of the carriage.

43
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,000
His majesty has arrived.

44
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,000
Greetings his majesty.

45
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
I long knew that you were pretending to sleep.

46
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,480
Its not convincing at all.

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,280
I can see the strands of your hair moving.

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
Si Lang sure likes to tease others.

49
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:07,840
That scar,

50
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,558
the color has lightened.

51
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:15,286
Peasant has become ugly. Please don't look Si Lang.

52
00:03:15,286 --> 00:03:17,748
Have you used the medication that I have sent you?

53
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,680
I used it.

54
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:24,011
It will be returned to its formal self in a few days time.

55
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:28,160
Such magnificent beauty.

56
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:29,880
Who can be compared to

57
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,543
you in this world?

58
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:34,440
I have a younger sister

59
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,310
name Yu Lao,

60
00:03:37,353 --> 00:03:40,651
her looks is definitely on par to mine.

61
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:43,290
To be able to be on par with you

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,480
I must have a look.

63
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:48,319
That won't do.

64
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,199
When Si Lang catch sight of my sister,

65
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,554
you can't wait to take her in as your wife.

66
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:56,815
Then I will have no place in your heart.

67
00:03:56,881 --> 00:03:58,359
It will make you jealous.

68
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:01,219
It might be someone superior.

69
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:05,814
It seems that I must get a new wife,

70
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:07,855
What do position do you want your sister to have?

71
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:09,945
precious? Maid servant?

72
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:13,360
or to be assigned as consort immediately?

73
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:17,599
Its a pity that

74
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:21,815
she is barely 10, and would have you to pardon her.

75
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
What are you thinking of?

76
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:33,600
I was thinking, since the times are good,

77
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,478
something like that.

78
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:37,957
Huan Huan...

79
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:41,198
You bear my child.

80
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,747
Do you know how happy that makes me?

81
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:45,598
I am happy too.

82
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,300
The white radiating from the flower

83
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,078
is comparable to your beauty.

84
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,718
The flower loses its color as it falls

85
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:09,400
it seems that Huan Huan's complexion is just as radiant.

86
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:16,817
While trying out the plum blossom make up, also known as plum make up

87
00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:20,545
Its hard to bring out the white in the pear blossom.

88
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:22,749
Such a pity...

89
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:25,948
Actually, its not hard.

90
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,082
Really?

91
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,900
What do Huan Huan think of this?

92
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,000
There is elegance in the petals of the flower.

93
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:54,063
The white of the pear blososm

94
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:56,753
it does not look real when applied with the fingers.

95
00:05:58,346 --> 00:06:01,014
Beautiful is enough, there is no need to seek realism.

96
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:05,866
This look, I will call it pear look.

97
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:11,022
Si Lang shall name what ever he creates.

98
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:15,307
I'm worried that others might think that you are bias to me.

99
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,600
I have made it clear that I will only be bias towards you.

100
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,900
Aren't you glad?

101
00:06:20,351 --> 00:06:23,871
Sister Mei just recovered, you should visit her too.

102
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,200
I have visited her just now. <br> It seems that she has gotten cold towards me.

103
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:34,718
Its because she has been sick for so long, its natural that she is bored.

104
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,878
Please pardon her for any in formalities.

105
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:42,278
Speaking of epidemic,

106
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:44,478
I just thought of something worrying.

107
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:47,038
Would it be alright if I hear about it?

108
00:06:48,078 --> 00:06:50,438
I have heard from Concubine Qin

109
00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:54,957
that there seems to be progress in the fight against the epidemic over at Jiang Sheng and Jiang Zhen.

110
00:06:55,717 --> 00:06:58,877
But they took money

111
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,437
from the maids and Eunuchs.

112
00:07:01,517 --> 00:07:03,877
Treating people base on power,

113
00:07:03,877 --> 00:07:07,997
they neglected those with less power

114
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:09,677
to take care of themselves.

115
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:11,557
Its the doctor's duty to help everyone.

116
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,837
Even though they can provide effective treatments, but they are going against their ethics.

117
00:07:15,277 --> 00:07:16,397
I feel

118
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:20,837
that this was also the reason

119
00:07:20,837 --> 00:07:22,157
why the plaque could not be stopped in time

120
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,800
I feel that way too. <br> Does your Majesty still recall

121
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:27,877
how Consort Hui was framed?<br>

122
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:30,796
I have not forgotten<br> It's just that

123
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:32,397
the plaque had not been contained , thus they cannot be killed just yet.

124
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:34,757
I will like to recommend someone to your Majesty

125
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,479
I will like to recommend someone to your Majesty

126
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:38,840
He can cure the plaque

127
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,080
Who is this person?

128
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,914
Imperial Physician, Wen Shi Chu

129
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:44,360
Why is that?

130
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,300
When Imperial Physician was treating Consort Hui, there was marked improvement

131
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,400
And i have heard that the Jiang brothers' cure originated from Wen's formula

132
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:56,360
If your Majesty don't believe me, you may investigate this in greater detail

133
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,880
Anyone who was treated by Imperial Physician Wen would heal that much faster

134
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,400
and with none of the side effects observed in those treated using Jiang's formula

135
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,640
Only because while the Jiangs' used Wen's formula as base

136
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,070
the medicinal dosage is more agressive

137
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:10,880
I will like to meet this Imperial Physician Wen

138
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,900
If what you said were true, the Jiang brothers cannot be allowed to remain any longer

139
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:18,320
Your Majesty spoke truly

140
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,622
however, with the plaque situation improving

141
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:29,622
the Jiang brothers are currently being credited hence it is not appropriate to eliminate them just yet

142
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,039
<br>

143
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,284
Yes. They are, after all Consort Hua's men.

144
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,159
However, if i had really wanted to punish them

145
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:43,880
there are lots of means to do so.

146
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,120
Alright, enough of this talk.

147
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:50,760
Alright.

148
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,700
Your birthday falls on April 17, and you are bearing my child.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,900
I wish to get the Internal Affairs Department organise a celebration for you

150
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:02,133
I will leave it to your Majesty

151
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:02,960
Good! I will help you decide

152
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,040
Sure.

153
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,600
As long as both you and the child are happy

154
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:11,560
Your majesty loves the child so much

155
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,080
and you've always stayed at consort Hua's place.

156
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,000
Why is consort Hua not pregnant?

157
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,000
I heard that

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,560
she has a miscarriage.

159
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,680
Is she injured because of the miscarriage?

160
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,719
I still have matters to attend to.

161
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,500
Xia Yi,

162
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,839
help me to exterminate 2 people.

163
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,598
Do it cleanly,

164
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:01,478
do not rouse any suspicion.

165
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,400
Yes I will take on your command. <br> You and your team

166
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,560
did well before.

167
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,118
Help me keep an eye on the former officers

168
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:13,799
and rebels.

169
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,201
The emperor has arrived!

170
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,400
Greetings your majesty

171
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,238
The 2 doctors were murdered on their way home. <br> Even their heads were missing.

172
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,839
The murderer dared to kill

173
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,439
in your majesty's presence.

174
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,200
That is simply breaking the rules!

175
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:14,359
Milady, I was

176
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:16,479
startled when I heard of the news.

177
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:18,559
I have already sent men to investigate.

178
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,679
Jiang gave treatment

179
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,239
to the victims. He will be

180
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,700
given credit for that. <br> Money will also be given

181
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,159
for his funeral.

182
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:34,117
Don't worry.

183
00:11:34,238 --> 00:11:35,877
What will happen now that 2 doctors have died?

184
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:39,198
You don't have to worry about that.

185
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,078
I have commanded Doctor Chu

186
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:44,918
to take over.

187
00:11:45,478 --> 00:11:50,398
Congratulations.

188
00:11:50,398 --> 00:11:54,638
Thank you. <br> Do look out for us in the future.

189
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:57,678
<br>

190
00:11:57,878 --> 00:12:00,038
How is the painting?

191
00:12:00,758 --> 00:12:02,318
<br>

192
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:05,358
The lady looks mild and kind,

193
00:12:06,438 --> 00:12:07,438
the artist did well.

194
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:11,198
A beauty

195
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:14,598
must have brains too.

196
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,800
Else, there will be no meaning in a beauty with no brains. She would just be a piece of wood.

197
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,800
So that is why

198
00:12:21,797 --> 00:12:23,997
your majesty

199
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,600
This coming 17th is her birthday., I've come here to arrange a party for her.

200
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:34,958
To make it a joyous occasion for her. Its just that the situation in Henan

201
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:37,518
just stablised.

202
00:12:38,126 --> 00:12:42,602
I have many things on my hands now, would like to get someone to help me arrange it.

203
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,429
Does your majesty want me to do it?

204
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:51,238
All I want for Lady Wan is some jewelry

205
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:56,109
But if I really can't present the surprise to her

206
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,419
I'm afraid she would not be sincerely happy.

207
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:04,500
You have to come up with some good ideas for me.

208
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:08,113
Such a free man as I am, I am best at this kind of duties.

209
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:09,588
Don't you worry about it.

210
00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,839
This peony stage has an excellent view of the river. <br> The late King Kang Xi

211
00:14:01,195 --> 00:14:03,390
have always come here to admire the peonies.

212
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:08,102
His majesty is celebrating her birthday here

213
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:10,156
isn't that over flattering her?

214
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,400
Where is Prince Guo? <br> Indeed, everyone is present all except for Prince Guo.

215
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:29,526
I'll get someone to look for him.

216
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:33,102
He's always behaving like this.

217
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:45,478
We're not aware of the latest make-up these days.

218
00:14:45,478 --> 00:14:49,758
Why did she draw a blossom

219
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:51,478
on her forehead?

220
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:55,358
His majesty drew it for her.

221
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:56,838
Its called the Pearl Flower Make-up,

222
00:14:57,511 --> 00:14:58,802
Its quite famous in town.

223
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:02,093
Its just like normal make-up.

224
00:15:02,997 --> 00:15:05,557
Nothing special about it.

225
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:10,483
His majesty drew it on for her, can't you tell how deep his love is?

226
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:27,036
Your majesty.

227
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:29,162
I would like to visit Sister Mei.

228
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:30,589
Okay, go along then.

229
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,706
His majesty loves Lady Wan more.

230
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:44,872
Not biased to her but his heart has been tied to her.

231
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:50,559
Other than Lady Wan, who else can serve his majesty in the Imperial study room?

232
00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:56,023
This is the first party that you have attended since your recovery. <br> Is your body doing okay?

233
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:58,983
I am doing fine, don't you worry.

234
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:07,548
Even if you've recovered, you're not as healthy as before.

235
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:10,127
I am really worried about you.

236
00:16:10,598 --> 00:16:12,465
Doctor Wan's skills are superb

237
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:15,531
but no matter how good he is ,

238
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,531
he can't cure my heart.

239
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:19,198
You have to take good

240
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:22,131
of yourself and your baby.

241
00:16:22,738 --> 00:16:24,378
You need the love from his majesty

242
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:26,282
in order to survive in this palace.

243
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:32,329
The love from his majesty only last for a span of 30-60 years.

244
00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:34,618
Everything is changing

245
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:36,659
nothing is for sure.

246
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,825
Seeing so, there is not point in worrying about it.

247
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:49,279
What happened?

248
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:52,644
Fu Jin is sick

249
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,804
I'll go over and take a look.

250
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,000
Are you not feeling well? <br> My heart is in pain

251
00:17:14,278 --> 00:17:16,598
its an old problem of mine.

252
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:18,691
Do take a seat.

253
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:23,724
Sorry for making you worry and dampening your mood in this party.

254
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:27,655
Please don't be. <br> Its normal for people to fall sick.

255
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:29,318
All will be well after taking some medicine.

256
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:34,317
Are you still taking the pill?

257
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,888
Yes, I have it with me all the time.

258
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:41,417
Sorry to be disturbing you.

259
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,826
We're sisters in the place and also relatives in our family.

260
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:47,262
You don't need to be so formal with me.

261
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:51,746
Prince is busy with work, you have to take good care of yourself.

262
00:17:52,177 --> 00:17:53,457
Thank you for your concern.

263
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,584
Is this the famous make-up?

264
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,274
Yes indeed.

265
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:07,091
Not only can we look as pretty as you, it also promotes the love between lovers.

266
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:10,249
This is a great love story that has spread throughout the town.

267
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,596
The people have always said that his majesty loves you the most.

268
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:17,429
You're so friendly and nice, no wonder his majesty showers you with so much love.

269
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:20,263
You've flattered me.

270
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:25,599
Prince Guo has already prepared your present at the lake side.

271
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,800
He has asked you and his majesty to make your way there<br> Understood.

272
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:30,524
I will make my way there now.

273
00:18:53,984 --> 00:18:58,955
Prince Guo has a lot of surprises, who knows what he's come up with.

274
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:00,504
Lets go and take a look.

275
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:03,182
Look!

276
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:52,811
Today is your birthday. Please make a wish on this kite.

277
00:20:02,312 --> 00:20:03,456
Look!

278
00:20:32,652 --> 00:20:33,305
Look!

279
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:40,327
Its unbelievable to see so many lotus flowers in April.

280
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,553
Listen!

281
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,720
Such a nice melody.

282
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:07,132
Such a beautiful melody,

283
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:08,896
well played on the flute.

284
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:13,600
It is every women's dream to in love with their husbands forever.

285
00:21:14,393 --> 00:21:16,751
Has your dream come true?

286
00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:31,687
Greetings miss,

287
00:21:32,306 --> 00:21:34,771
in a lake filled with lotus.

288
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:38,066
Thank you for the hard work, I like it very much.

289
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:42,151
I asked you to come with special ideas for me. <br> Who knew you did so well.

290
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,300
Your majesty has tasked me with the planning of her birthday celebrations,

291
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:47,523
I will most definitely try my best.

292
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:52,272
May I know how you managed to make the lotus flowers bloom at this time of the year?

293
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,311
The lotus seeds have been planted a long time ago.

294
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,390
Using the water from the spa

295
00:21:57,953 --> 00:21:59,447
the lotus was able to bloom.

296
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:01,728
Thank you, your majesty.

297
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:08,158
You're milady now, naturally, your family members will be given a title too.

298
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:13,647
I've already given your mother the title of Madam of Gao Ming.

299
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:16,708
Thank you, your majesty.

300
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:34,671
My mother is the real Madam of Gao Ming.

301
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:38,658
Now her mother has also been given that title.

302
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:43,124
Maybe his majesty made the decision rashly.

303
00:22:43,386 --> 00:22:44,951
No.

304
00:22:45,707 --> 00:22:50,024
His majesty promised to name my mother Class 2 Madam of Gao Ming.

305
00:22:51,158 --> 00:22:54,928
But the empress objected because I am only a consort.

306
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,922
My mother can't be given the title of Madam.

307
00:22:57,467 --> 00:23:00,381
My mother did not get the title in the end.

308
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:02,568
Zhen Huan is just a concubine.

309
00:23:03,051 --> 00:23:05,379
But his majesty is flatter her like this.

310
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:08,367
If she gives birth to a prince,

311
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:11,069
she will bully me.

312
00:23:11,354 --> 00:23:13,121
That won't happen. <br>Why won't it?

313
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:16,743
Other gave birth to a baby, you gave birth to a baby too.

314
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:19,447
But you end up being just a honored lady.

315
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,585
She becomes a Concubine even before she got pregnant.

316
00:23:22,353 --> 00:23:25,322
In the end, you're just useless.

317
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:27,578
Don't be angry.

318
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:30,404
Don't suffer because of that anger.

319
00:23:30,746 --> 00:23:32,201
Not be angry?

320
00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:36,420
My anger will only be subdued if I kill her.

321
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:42,389
Miss...

322
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,822
I know what you want to say.

323
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,449
We must continue living our lives no matter how hard it is.

324
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:50,054
I'm worried about you.

325
00:23:57,225 --> 00:24:01,281
There is no need to worry about me. I'm used to it already.

326
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:05,001
She dared to shout at you like that even though you are the mother of the princess.

327
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,447
My only wish is for my princess to grow up peacefully.

328
00:24:11,044 --> 00:24:13,599
Other things don't matter at all.

329
00:24:14,317 --> 00:24:17,518
But Consort Hua and Lady Wan don't get along too well at all.

330
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:19,929
Its risky to stand between them.

331
00:24:20,196 --> 00:24:21,925
She is only interested in me getting rid of Lady Wan.

332
00:24:22,931 --> 00:24:25,529
But she does not know how hard it is.

333
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,125
She is powerful now,

334
00:24:28,694 --> 00:24:32,802
she will become even more powerful than Consort Hua the moment she gives birth to a prince.

335
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,708
You have to decide for yourself.

336
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:41,562
Decide? What else can I decide for myself?

337
00:24:47,032 --> 00:24:51,884
Life in the palace has always been the same, nothing special at all.

338
00:24:52,276 --> 00:24:54,609
Summer palace is much more fun than this.

339
00:24:56,905 --> 00:25:00,760
The weather is great today. <br>Why don't you accompany to fly a kite?

340
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:06,303
I kept 2 kites for you during your birthday.

341
00:25:07,024 --> 00:25:09,499
You're really playful.

342
00:25:10,874 --> 00:25:15,583
I heard that you broke a vase that was given by his majesty while playing last night.

343
00:25:15,606 --> 00:25:17,312
His majesty won't be angry at me.

344
00:25:17,968 --> 00:25:22,754
Stop reading Sister. <br><br> Let's take a walk outside.

345
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:26,152
You're always staying in this room.

346
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,725
Who knows, your baby prince might grow up to become a lazy prince.

347
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:35,222
Sure, why not. I'm feeling a little bored too.

348
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,782
Miss, do stay indoors.

349
00:25:38,248 --> 00:25:41,252
Hasn't Lady Fucha's incident have you worried?

350
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:43,056
We call for more servants to escort us.

351
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,158
Let's go out, shall we?<br> Okay.

352
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,660
How's my kite flying? <br> Very well.

353
00:26:00,652 --> 00:26:03,430
I loved to fly kites when I was back in my house.

354
00:26:03,992 --> 00:26:08,937
Because you're good at kite flying, his majesty said that

355
00:26:08,987 --> 00:26:10,726
he will give the title of honored lady after mid autumn.

356
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:16,697
His majesty likes me and you right? <br> Yes, we all do.

357
00:26:17,272 --> 00:26:19,451
Do you like seeing me fly kite? <br> I do.

358
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,319
I used to ask Sister Mei to fly kites with me back when I was trying to sew.

359
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:28,205
I will bring your baby to fly kites in the future too!

360
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:33,091
I wish my princess will be as active as you.

361
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:38,063
Oh no! The thread broke!<br> I'll go retrieve the kite.

362
00:26:39,134 --> 00:26:41,741
Follow her and help her get the kit back.

363
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:45,453
No one is to follow me<br> They'll only get in the way if they do.

364
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,464
Follow her from a distance.<br> Yes.

365
00:27:01,136 --> 00:27:03,448
Don't follow me and wait for me here<br> Yes.

366
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:20,382
At ease. I have a message here for your general.

367
00:27:22,415 --> 00:27:23,419
Yes I know.

368
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:31,050
The people up there are all looking to be officers. Go see if the general have any use of them.

369
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:36,844
Yes, just as general had said, if there is anything unsatisfactory, I will pass on the message.

370
00:27:37,081 --> 00:27:40,518
The general will settle it for you<br> Good.

371
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:45,790
Tell him that we must have our own men in the palace.

372
00:27:46,004 --> 00:27:51,912
Try to destroy all those who are against us, Lady Wan's father for example.

373
00:27:53,562 --> 00:27:54,795
Yes.

374
00:27:55,261 --> 00:28:00,924
General did not kill her father the last time, fearing that it might arouse his majesty's attention.

375
00:28:02,193 --> 00:28:05,691
I am not concerned with how he did it, when he did it.

376
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,676
Don't make a noise.

377
00:28:08,964 --> 00:28:10,672
It'll be worse if we shout.

378
00:28:10,895 --> 00:28:14,715
Don't come to my palace without my permission. I don't wish to arouse any suspicion.

379
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,152
I will call for you when I want to.

380
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:27,122
Yes/

381
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,616
Be quiet!

382
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:26,330
Greeting Lady Cao

383
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,649
Greetings Lady Wan

384
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:33,331
At ease.

385
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,718
Its okay.

386
00:29:37,854 --> 00:29:40,729
Such a coincidence to be meeting you here.

387
00:29:51,474 --> 00:29:52,948
Take a seat.

388
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:58,291
Its been a long time since we talked.

389
00:29:58,766 --> 00:30:00,059
You can call me sis.

390
00:30:01,764 --> 00:30:02,506
Sis,

391
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:06,111
You should be more careful since you're pregnant.

392
00:30:06,662 --> 00:30:10,689
You now dare to send people off.

393
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:14,220
Stop joking around. <br> I am with you now.

394
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:17,780
If anything bad were to happen to me, it will naturally be blamed on you.

395
00:30:18,621 --> 00:30:21,457
I will surely take good care of sister.

396
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:25,952
No one will be here to push me anyway.

397
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,146
Aren't you humorous.

398
00:30:34,048 --> 00:30:39,365
Who would dare to push you? <br> I doubt they would even dare touch your finger.

399
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:46,785
How is Princess Wen-Yi doing?

400
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:49,126
Don't you worry.

401
00:30:49,636 --> 00:30:52,666
Its only a small cough, nothing serious.

402
00:30:52,812 --> 00:30:57,139
True, as long as there's no mix up between potato powder,

403
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,831
I'm sure she'll be most fine.

404
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:06,131
Didn't his majesty already punished Xiao Tang who mixed it up?

405
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:09,903
I'm sure this incident will not happen again.

406
00:31:10,231 --> 00:31:12,472
I hope so too.

407
00:31:13,073 --> 00:31:15,855
I'll be a mother too soon.

408
00:31:16,202 --> 00:31:19,512
I can fully understand how a mother feels.

409
00:31:20,122 --> 00:31:22,863
Its not easy for you to take care of princess.

410
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:27,613
I heard that you have a difficult time giving birth.

411
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:28,956
Yes.

412
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,305
Becoming a mother is not an easy task.

413
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:35,027
Having to worry about her all the time.

414
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:38,510
My heart aches whenever she's sick or in pain.

415
00:31:38,623 --> 00:31:41,024
I rather be the one in pain.

416
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:46,366
You are a smart person. I'm sure you know how to take care of princess.

417
00:31:47,195 --> 00:31:49,890
But I would to remind you of one thing.

418
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:54,452
Its good to have the protection of others, but its also important to note the person protecting you.

419
00:31:55,471 --> 00:31:59,307
Or else you will be suffering other the actions of others and be able to express your sorrows.

420
00:32:04,377 --> 00:32:09,562
Your little sister is a little silly, pardon me.

421
00:32:10,187 --> 00:32:13,224
If sister doesn't understand, how would I?

422
00:32:13,636 --> 00:32:20,157
But I do know of one thing. The reason why Consort Hua is not doing anything

423
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,030
is because someone is helping her.

424
00:32:23,517 --> 00:32:27,936
I feel thankful to her even though she's not doing it to help me.

425
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,262
I also understand that...

426
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:35,900
those who aid the hands of evil will come to no good.

427
00:32:37,152 --> 00:32:41,611
The best way to protect yourself is to leave the evil doings and join the good.

428
00:33:01,209 --> 00:33:05,035
Lady Wan, let's go to the rocky areas.

429
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:13,313
Men!

430
00:33:15,084 --> 00:33:17,915
Why hasn't Lady Chun returned? <br><br> Didn't the eunuchs follow her?

431
00:33:17,987 --> 00:33:20,653
Get men to look for her! <br> Hurry!

432
00:33:49,378 --> 00:33:50,826
Have you found her?

433
00:33:52,588 --> 00:33:54,323
Found her<br> -Good.

434
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:58,877
Its late, I'm sure she's hungry. Are the desserts ready? <br><br> - Ready

435
00:33:59,006 --> 00:34:00,341
Bring it here then.

436
00:34:03,473 --> 00:34:05,118
What happened?

437
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,918
Is she being punished?

438
00:34:10,229 --> 00:34:11,750
Miss...

439
00:34:11,835 --> 00:34:13,288
Lady Chun...

440
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,020
She died in the lotus lake.

441
00:34:18,177 --> 00:34:20,041
By the time we found her,

442
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,947
her hand was still holding on to the the thread of her kite.

443
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,658
Miss!!

444
00:34:33,424 --> 00:34:35,879
She was still flying her kite in the afternoon,

445
00:34:37,506 --> 00:34:40,778
how could she have died in the lotus lake?

446
00:34:42,312 --> 00:34:44,344
She's only 17.

447
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:45,478
Miss.

448
00:35:00,937 --> 00:35:03,290
We were chatting happily in the afternoon

449
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:07,620
I even told her that

450
00:35:08,392 --> 00:35:11,328
his majesty will rank her as honored lady after mid autumn.

451
00:35:12,429 --> 00:35:15,571
She was even eating the food that I prepared for her.

452
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:19,042
She said,

453
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,820
that she wants to be my child's god mother.

454
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:32,397
The bangle is still there.

455
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:42,075
Don't be too sad miss.

456
00:35:45,308 --> 00:35:46,329
Madam

457
00:35:46,863 --> 00:35:50,116
Lady Chun's body is now placed in the Rain Chamber.

458
00:35:56,022 --> 00:35:57,436
Miss!

459
00:35:57,685 --> 00:36:01,194
Look after Miss, she must not run! <br> Be careful Miss.

460
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:03,528
Miss!

461
00:36:04,946 --> 00:36:07,306
You must not go.

462
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:12,430
His majesty does not allow you to go because of your pregnancy. <br> Please don't go there.

463
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:17,568
You can't go there! <br> Please think of your baby and yourself!

464
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:22,154
Miss!

465
00:36:22,506 --> 00:36:25,136
His majesty has arrived.

466
00:36:27,879 --> 00:36:30,165
Your majesty!

467
00:36:30,513 --> 00:36:33,356
Don't be sad.

468
00:36:33,697 --> 00:36:38,532
Its all my fault, I shouldn't have gone kite flying with her.

469
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:42,765
I should not have allowed her to pick that kite by herself. <br> Your majesty.

470
00:36:42,892 --> 00:36:46,164
Boil some sedative soup.<br> Yes.

471
00:36:46,188 --> 00:36:49,042
I feel sad about her death too.

472
00:36:49,371 --> 00:36:55,399
I promise you. Her funeral will be held based on an honored lady.

473
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:02,355
Please your majesty. I beg you to let me look at Lady Chun for the last time.<br> Please your majesty.

474
00:37:08,324 --> 00:37:11,837
You did a nice and clean job this time.

475
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:16,341
I will give you credit for that.

476
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:21,880
I dare not accept credit from your highness.

477
00:37:22,376 --> 00:37:30,173
God is helping me this time. If we did not know about her presence, it might ruin my wealth.

478
00:37:30,193 --> 00:37:32,710
and destroy my plan.

479
00:37:33,013 --> 00:37:37,482
Madam is merciless, no one will dare get in your way.

480
00:37:38,271 --> 00:37:40,974
That kid is wicked.

481
00:37:41,763 --> 00:37:45,746
I'm sure Zhen Huan is deeply saddened because of her death.

482
00:37:46,442 --> 00:37:51,298
It brings me joy to see her tears.

483
00:37:52,357 --> 00:38:00,944
Madam is elegant, Zhen Huan can't be compared to you.

484
00:38:06,147 --> 00:38:08,981
Don't think too much, Miss.

485
00:38:09,346 --> 00:38:11,384
No one would have wanted this to happen.

486
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:17,046
That...

487
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:22,249
Is that Yu-Er?

488
00:38:25,491 --> 00:38:28,432
You must avenge Lady Chun.

489
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:32,403
What happened? Tell me.

490
00:38:32,474 --> 00:38:33,799
Lady Chun...

491
00:38:34,534 --> 00:38:36,569
died under the hands of a murder.

492
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:39,311
That's not something to be taken lightly of.

493
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:45,130
Lady Chun lived near the river since young. She's a good swimmer, its not possible for her to drown.

494
00:38:45,141 --> 00:38:47,985
There is more to her death.

495
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:53,058
Jin-Xi, what did the people who followed Chun say?

496
00:38:53,382 --> 00:38:57,105
They said that Chun ran really fast. She was near the rockery in no time.

497
00:38:57,328 --> 00:38:59,095
They could not catch up with her.

498
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:01,458
They lost her after that.

499
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:04,484
She was last found near the lotus lake.

500
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:07,379
Everyone thought that she fell into the lake.

501
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,256
I think there is something more to it.

502
00:39:11,214 --> 00:39:13,037
Lady Cao

503
00:39:13,656 --> 00:39:15,991
asked me to take a look over at the rockery.

504
00:39:16,895 --> 00:39:19,013
Does she know anything?

505
00:39:19,054 --> 00:39:21,524
or did she purposely...

506
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:25,317
came to stop me from finding out about this sooner?

507
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:27,886
I have got to ask her<br> -Miss.

508
00:39:28,154 --> 00:39:32,288
There's nothing you can get out of her now.

509
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:49,997
We've not no evidence now.

510
00:39:50,492 --> 00:39:55,758
If Chun really was murdered, I will avenge her.

511
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,457
I won't let her die in vain.
