00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
The Legend of Zhen Huan
Episode 28

1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,200
Isn't it fun?

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,466
Seems like Miss is in a good mood today

3
00:00:09,903 --> 00:00:12,300
Being able to gain advantage from both sides

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,670
Actually

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,000
Miss need not to alert Consort Hua <br>to find out about Lay Chun

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,000
We could've covered it at first

7
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:23,264
other people would have suspected me.

8
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:29,423
I'd rather be left alone.<br> She deserves it for treading on forbidden ground.

9
00:00:29,423 --> 00:00:32,888
Its understandable for Consort Hua to protect Lady Chen.

10
00:00:32,888 --> 00:00:35,120
Why did you inform Consort Wan?

11
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:40,696
Consort Hua is having the time of her life, while Consort Wan is slowly catching up.

12
00:00:40,753 --> 00:00:46,696
Even though I am on Consort Wan's side, I'm going with the flow.

13
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:51,494
Even though she knows that its too late to save Lady Chen,

14
00:00:51,494 --> 00:00:57,495
but perhaps when Consort Wan dominates the palace one day,

15
00:00:57,554 --> 00:00:59,620
she would not put me in a difficult spot just because of what i told her today.

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,628
Didn't Consort Wan suspect that it was Niang niang who pushed her?

17
00:01:06,294 --> 00:01:09,760
Everyone can suspect who they want. But she does not have any evidence.

18
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:13,285
If she does, did you think I can still sit here peacefully?

19
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:19,503
Isn't that right? Its the fight of the century.

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,700
Instead of getting into trouble, its best that one finds an escape route.

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,100
Is it right?

22
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,500
Greetings your Majesty.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I needed to finish looking through the proposals before coming over.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,400
Am I too late?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Its never too late as long as your heart is here. <br> I'll wait for you.

26
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:41,615
So I will come no matter how late it is.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,700
Your majesty must be tired from working all day.

28
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,700
How did you not know that i will be coming?

29
00:01:58,732 --> 00:02:00,224
Why did you prepare this?

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
I am constantly wishing Emperor you will come here.

31
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,700
So I always prepare it.

32
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:11,667
With this kind thoughts from you,

33
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,600
I would have missed you if I did not come.

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,000
It looks to me that you're in a good mood today.

35
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:22,278
Could there be any good news?

36
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,142
The war in the South east

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,300
your bother and nephew has accomplished a great achievement.

38
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,300
I have decided to grand your brother the title of First Class Duke.

39
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:37,822
Your father's title will be ascended

40
00:02:37,822 --> 00:02:41,235
to Grand Mentor.

41
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:45,156
While your brother's previous title of First Class Baron

42
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:47,959
will be given to his second son, Nian Fu.

43
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:52,794
I will then grand your mother the title of Madam of Gao Ming.

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,100
What do you think?

45
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:55,833
Thank you your majesty.

46
00:02:56,952 --> 00:03:02,830
I was thinking about Consort Wan's sadness over the death of Lady Chen.

47
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:04,877
To console her,

48
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:08,349
I will ascend her father's position.

49
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:12,618
Didn't you think that Consort Wan's father was disrespectful to you?

50
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:15,779
I have given him his punishment.

51
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,879
If you're against it, I will leave in the Conserate,

52
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:24,948
and only raised his title as officer. What do you think? <br>

53
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:28,558
I dare not justify against your majesty's decision.

54
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,142
As long as Consort wan is happy.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Its great that you're so mature.

56
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,600
You've been holding on to the title of Consort for quite some time.

57
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:45,735
I'm planning to ascend your title after mid autumn.

58
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:52,474
All I wish is to accompany your majesty.

59
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,910
I care nothing about titles.

60
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,100
Greetings to your highness.

61
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,300
Raise.

62
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:03,043
Thank you, your highness.

63
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,356
Greetings to Consort Hua.

64
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,600
Raise.

65
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:10,476
Thank you Consort Hua.

66
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:14,232
What is with all of you today?

67
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:20,352
As close sisters,it is only natural for us to congratulate you after hearing his majesty's decision to ascend your title

68
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,831
Your highness has always lived in bliss.

69
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,188
Who knew that my days would come too.

70
00:04:30,231 --> 00:04:34,269
Consort Hua, what do you mean by that?

71
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:42,866
We've congratulated you when you were granted the title of Fujin.

72
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:47,079
You are always in control, how smart of you.

73
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:51,587
No matter how smart I am, it can't be compared to your highness's intelligence.

74
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,868
Your highness knows his majesty best.

75
00:04:54,868 --> 00:05:00,578
May I know what title will I be granted by his majesty?

76
00:05:00,578 --> 00:05:05,433
Title above Consort is Imperial Consort, while Imperial Honored Consort is even higher.

77
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:07,947
It should be one of them.

78
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:09,467
Niang Niang, you are wrong.

79
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,000
There's the title of Empress above Imperial Hornored Consort.

80
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,500
Are you saying that you're

81
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:20,092
interested in my title of Empress?

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,600
Niang Niang, you are overthinking.

83
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,167
I happen to know that the title of Imperial Hornored Consort is equivalent to Empress.

84
00:05:27,217 --> 00:05:30,655
Back when Imperial hornored Consort Dong-E was alive

85
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:35,176
Empress Bo Er Ji Jin did not even have the right to speak.

86
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:37,256
How knowledgable of you.

87
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,900
No matter how pretigious the title of Imperial Honored Consort is, it is equivalent to Empress.

88
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:44,890
Empress will always be empress.

89
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:49,773
Even with the Imperial Honored Consort, there can only be one mother of the nation.

90
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:55,664
Consort Dong-E was still not recognized even after being crowned Imperial Honored Consort.

91
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:58,958
It was never formal nor official.

92
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:05,500
With your intelligence, surely you understand where your place lies.

93
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:09,820
All I know is that, there will always be an outcry against justice.

94
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:15,239
My opinions stirred up such a fuss from your higness.

95
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:19,854
Others might have thought that your highness is frightened just

96
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,133
like Imperial Honored Consort Bo Er Ji Jin.

97
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:28,000
Its my duty as the empress to set the rules in the back palace.

98
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:34,400
You should learn form you so that you could perhaps use it in the future.

99
00:06:34,438 --> 00:06:36,519
I will your highness's words in mind.

100
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:42,692
I will surely fulfill my duty once I get ascended.

101
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:46,649
So that empress could rest.

102
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:58,186
You've been in low spirits

103
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:01,176
ever since the passing of lady Chen.

104
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,200
I'm relived that you're finally

105
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,000
willing go out.

106
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:10,106
Sister Mei could have accompanied me, but she has not recovered yet.

107
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:13,548
Lady An is not feeling well either.

108
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:19,010
But Consort Jing would come over and talk to me.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
Consort Jin is indeed a warm hearted person.

110
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:30,200
I gave you a white parrot, fearing that you might be bored. Do you like it?

111
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,400
Its really interesting, I really like it a lot.

112
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,400
Reporting to your majesty.

113
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,700
Officer Long Ko Do is here.

114
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,700
I will be taking my leave now.

115
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,300
Send him in.

116
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,600
Yes.

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,500
greetings your majesty.

118
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,100
Uncle Long Ko Do

119
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,600
rise.

120
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,500
Thank you, your majesty.

121
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:06,270
Have a seat.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,400
Is there anything urgent

123
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,200
that you wish to see about?

124
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,900
I have found out that the Nian Gengyao mansion in capital city

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,100
is under a huge renovation.

126
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,600
The houses of others around it were also demolished for the sake of a garden.

127
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:31,342
His mansion as big as Prince's estate.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,200
I've just rewarded him. Its normal that he renovates his home extravagantly.

129
00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:43,832
Because Nian Gengyao's action, the people around him has lost their homes.

130
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,900
Many of them are left homeless.

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,300
Now that he is in capital city, back in Qing Hai

132
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,900
who knows, General Nian's house might get even bigger than prince's estate.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,700
Your taking this too seriously.

134
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,000
Although Nain Geng Yao is arrogant,

135
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
he is a man who knows his place.

136
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,400
Your majesty,

137
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,500
Uncle and Nian Geng Yao have never gotten along.

138
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,959
Niang Geng Yao was born as a servant.

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,100
Even though you're my uncle,

140
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,000
there are a lot of things that I need to learn from you.

141
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Perhaps its because of your presence,

142
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:23,351
that Nian Geng Yao would not dare to be overboard.

143
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
I will never forget,

144
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,400
your majesty's kindness.

145
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,900
I heard that Empress Dowager is not feeling well.

146
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:34,957
Has she gotten any better?

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,800
I would like to greet her highness.

148
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:39,996
You must be tired from travelling,

149
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:42,949
now that mother is sick

150
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,900
if not she could have a conversation with uncle.

151
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,900
Imperial doctors said that she needs to rest.

152
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:52,224
Perhaps now is not a suitable time to meet her.

153
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,500
How about paying her a visit when she gets better?

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,300
Your servant will take his leave now.

155
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,100
Look.

156
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,700
Your sewing is getting better.

157
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:19,192
These flowers that you sew are looking very realistic.

158
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,300
You're teasing me again.

159
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,300
I was never good at sewing in the past. I only started getting better at it when I entered the palace.

160
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,200
This belly band is full of a mother's love.

161
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:31,223
It is naturally the best.

162
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,900
Miss, Consort Jing,

163
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,600
Servants from the palace reported that the empress is having a severe headache and is feeling very comfortable.

164
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,600
Please proceed to the palace if you're free.

165
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,200
Who is serving her at the moment?

166
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,900
Consort Hua is with the emperor.

167
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,600
Lady Fucha just had a miscarriage, Lady Hui and Lady an are still ill.

168
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,400
Consort Qi and Lady Xin are serving her now.

169
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,000
Alright, I'm going now.

170
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,900
I shall go along with you.

171
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:02,956
Stay here if you're not feeling well.

172
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,400
Empress seldom feels uncomfortable, I will feel bad for not serving her.

173
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,900
I shall go with you.

174
00:11:08,952 --> 00:11:10,080
alright then.

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,300
Your highness.

176
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,300
Please stay strong.

177
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,400
Please hang in there your higness.

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,900
Jian qiu

179
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Is the imperial doctor here yet?

180
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,600
Not yet.

181
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,900
Why didn't you cal for the imperial doctor earlier?

182
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,300
Its not that I didn't, but the imperial doctors on duty are not around.

183
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:51,964
Why?

184
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,798
I've asked them earlier, besides the doctors taking care of

185
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,300
Empress Dowager, that can't be disturbed.

186
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,400
The rest were all taken by General Nian.

187
00:12:02,402 --> 00:12:04,671
How did things turn out like this?

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,600
Heard that General Nian's is down with a serious illness,

189
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,900
he took all the imperial doctors with him this afternoon

190
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:13,620
to take care of his wife.

191
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,500
How could he act this way?

192
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,800
This is way too ridiculous.

193
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,700
How can the empress of the nation not have an imperial doctor?

194
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,400
How can they all be at the minister's mansion.

195
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,000
Your highness.

196
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,100
Send someone

197
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,100
to bring back those imperial doctors.

198
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,800
I did.

199
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,400
But General Nian says that his wife is in need of them.

200
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,700
He even said that the imperial doctors are not to return until his wife has recovered.

201
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,900
Did you inform the Emperor about this?

202
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:47,210
Her highness ordered to not alert his majesty.

203
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,200
Besides...no one would dare disturb him while he is at Consort Hua's place.

204
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,900
Why didn't you inform the emperor

205
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:55,175
when she is not feeling well?

206
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,000
I...

207
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,500
What are waiting for?

208
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,500
Go!

209
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,000
Don't go, its late. The emperor needs his rest.

210
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:09,953
Or else he'll be too tired tomorrow to handle his work.

211
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,200
But the imperial doctors must at least be called over.

212
00:13:12,242 --> 00:13:15,712
Its normal for the imperial doctors to be Nian's mansion.

213
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,200
The gates are all closed now, I don't wish to create anymore problems.

214
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,000
The imperial doctors will be back by tomorrow morning.

215
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,800
Your highness.

216
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,100
Enough, that's it.

217
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,700
Madam,

218
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,300
empress was sick again last night.

219
00:13:55,316 --> 00:13:57,645
She suffered through the night because of her headache.

220
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:00,068
So it is true.

221
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,500
I'll go over later

222
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,400
to greet her highness.

223
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,700
Brother is too much this time. How could he have taken all the imperial doctors?

224
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,000
What if there's a sudden order by the emperor?

225
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,600
Send my words out.

226
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,500
Tell them to send the imperial doctors who are done with their work back.

227
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes.

228
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,800
Wait...

229
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:18,537
Wait.

230
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Come and take a look at the emperor's breakfast with me.

231
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The emperor likes pickles, put it in front.

232
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,900
Yes.

233
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,000
Wait.

234
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:39,600
Emperor only had a few bites of these buns yesterday, he must be bored of them. Put it further away.

235
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,100
Reporting to Madam

236
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,700
The eunuch from the Imperial Household is here.

237
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,900
What brings him here so early in the morning?

238
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,000
Bring them in.

239
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:51,872
Yes.

240
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,400
Greetings to Consort Hua.

241
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,100
Isn't this the attire of an Imperial Honored Consort?

242
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,200
Who ordered you to send them here?

243
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,300
Your servants are just carrying out orders from our superior.

244
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,300
Could it be from the Emperor?

245
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,900
Your servant does not know.

246
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,000
Who would dare to send out such an order other than the emperor?

247
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,400
Both of you have worked hard.

248
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,900
Please follow Eunuch Zhou to redeem your rewards.

249
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:32,134
Thank you Madam.

250
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,100
Yes.

251
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,400
This way please.

252
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,900
Congratulations Imperial Honored Consort.

253
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,400
Your majesty, I have issues to report to you.

254
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,600
Go ahead.

255
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,400
I heard that there was no imperial doctor attending to empress's headache last night.

256
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,300
She could not get any treatment last night due to the absence of Imperial doctors.

257
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,400
The empress is the mother of the nation, its the imperial doctor's fault,

258
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,800
for not treating Empress when she was ill.

259
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,100
Because of someone's selfish needs, there was no imperial doctor around.

260
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:26,755
This person should be punished for causing empress pain from not being treated on time.

261
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Reporting to your majesty.

262
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,900
My wife was sick yesterday afternoon.

263
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:49,275
I was anxious and bought over the imperial doctors who were on duty.

264
00:16:49,314 --> 00:16:53,238
I didn't expect that the empress would get a headache.

265
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:57,146
It is all my fault, but I was anxious back then.

266
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,000
Please spare me your majesty.

267
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Rise.

268
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,800
Thank you your majesty.

269
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,444
I've always sent imperial doctors to treat

270
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,000
your injured hand too.

271
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,200
Now that your wife is sick,

272
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,900
its natural that you're anxious.

273
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:49,095
As his husband, you had to help her.

274
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,900
Is your wife's condition any better?

275
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,100
Thank you for your majesty's concern. She is feeling much better this morning.

276
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,200
I've sent all the imperial doctors back to palace.

277
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,900
You will have to be more rational in the future,

278
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,800
even if you are feeling anxious.

279
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,800
Yes.

280
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,400
It is necessary to have an imperial doctor on duty in the palace, in case anything sudden were to happen.

281
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,900
I was wrong.

282
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,300
I would dare not allow this to repeat again.

283
00:18:31,423 --> 00:18:33,770
As an officer in court,

284
00:18:34,397 --> 00:18:36,068
as a husband at home,

285
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:40,263
official matters are important,

286
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:44,970
so does family.

287
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:50,037
Just like General Nian,

288
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:53,676
as a wise officer in court,

289
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:59,177
as a dutiful husband at home.

290
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:00,956
Yes.

291
00:19:08,661 --> 00:19:10,380
You were here in the morning before.

292
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:13,224
You're here again. Be careful not to tire yourself out.

293
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,301
Don't worry your highness.

294
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:16,760
I am fine.

295
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:18,557
I just want to accompany you.

296
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:21,053
I'm feeling better.

297
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,393
The imperial doctor has already checked on me.

298
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,790
Such a thing happened,

299
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,498
even the ministers are complaining about it.

300
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:28,920
It was said that not only was the emperor not angry

301
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:31,107
he even praised General Nian.

302
00:19:32,397 --> 00:19:35,313
It is just an old ailment, nothing serious.

303
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:37,902
Has the emperor visited your highness?

304
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:41,737
He came over earlier in the morning and even left after I've taken my medication.

305
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:44,538
The emperor is so busy,

306
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:47,305
I don't wish to cause him any inconvenience.

307
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:50,158
Its obvious that the emperor is on Nian's side.

308
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:55,880
They have send the imperial honored consort clothes over.

309
00:20:00,684 --> 00:20:01,436
Imperial Doctor Wen.

310
00:20:04,374 --> 00:20:05,859
Greetings to Consort Wan

311
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:10,309
You must be really busy being the head imperial doctor in charge.

312
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:14,303
Thanks to his majesty's regards, I will definitely do my best.

313
00:20:14,668 --> 00:20:16,869
I have something to ask you.

314
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,313
All the imperial doctors on duty were all called to General Nian's mansion.

315
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:22,232
Causing the palace to be void of imperial doctors.

316
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:25,832
How many of them are on duty usually?

317
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:29,446
The incident last night has empress's health involved.

318
00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:31,946
We feel really guilty and awful about it.

319
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:34,602
I've asked the rest of my colleagues.

320
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,387
Last night, General Nian took Imperial Doctor Li and Zhang.

321
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:41,149
Imperial Doctor Chen and Zhao were still in the palace on duty.

322
00:20:41,422 --> 00:20:43,624
Eunuch Jiang Fu-Hai came later.

323
00:20:43,732 --> 00:20:45,557
Seeing them not around and thought that

324
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,647
Since Precious Fuca just had a miscarriage and While Imperial concubine Wan is pregnant.

325
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:52,400
It's a must that we have experienced doctors around.

326
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:56,312
So he told both doctors on duty to switch with Imperial Doctor Li and Imperial Doctor Zhang.

327
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:59,035
Nian Gengyao is in need of people.

328
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,700
Since both of them are experienced, of course he wouldn't let them both switch.

329
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,786
What about those not on duty?

330
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:08,900
Could they enter the palace once summoned?

331
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,700
Although the gates are closed at night, but it can be arranged.

332
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,200
It should be fine if there's an order from the Empress

333
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,400
Just that it involves a lot of work. It might bother others.

334
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,500
Understood

335
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,100
Thank you Doctor Wen.

336
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:28,949
Niang Niang is pregnant right now, I can't serve by your side.

337
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:31,394
How is everything?

338
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,300
Imperial Doctor Zhang is a reliable person.

339
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,600
Everything's fine.

340
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,300
I'm relieved to hear that..

341
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,800
i'll pay you a visit next time.

342
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:51,942
Madam asked about Ministry of Imperial Doctor.

343
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,500
Perhaps there's doubt in your mind?

344
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm just guessing.

345
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:04,300
Empress is a through person

346
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,225
Could it be...

347
00:22:06,253 --> 00:22:10,160
She's afraid to disturb the others due to her own illness.

348
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,740
That's why she's keeping it low profile?

349
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:13,740
If she wants to keep it low profiled

350
00:22:14,108 --> 00:22:16,444
She wouldn't ask for Concubine's serving

351
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:21,875
Doesn't matter if she's a through person or if there's a hidden agenda.

352
00:22:22,665 --> 00:22:25,478
Since we're taking the Empress's side.

353
00:22:25,872 --> 00:22:28,247
We shall just go with the flow.

354
00:22:35,698 --> 00:22:37,065
What book are you reading?

355
00:22:39,254 --> 00:22:42,089
I saw this book of Zou Zhaun on the table.

356
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,100
It's really interesting

357
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:47,220
Which passage you're reading? Tell me about it.

358
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,227
Journey of Zheng Bo killing Duan

359
00:22:50,794 --> 00:22:53,824
It's an old story. Why'd you like this passage?

360
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,827
Although it's an old story, but there's something that people could learn from it.

361
00:22:59,707 --> 00:23:01,753
Madam Jiang's love for her youngest son makes her

362
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,200
intended to replace Lord Zhuang with Duke Duan. Lord Zhuang tolerance caused a outrage

363
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,500
That leads to the death Duke Duan

364
00:23:08,742 --> 00:23:10,211
That's the best strategies as an Emperor.

365
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:12,835
I think Lord Zhuang's moves seems proper.

366
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:18,103
I've been receiving complaints about Nian Gengyao.

367
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:20,392
Saying that he's arrogant.

368
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,600
I know nothing about official matters

369
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:27,215
Just hat this passage seems fine

370
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:32,255
Now that you said it. I think the words are sharp

371
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,400
and worthy to read

372
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
There's a sentence that is very vivid

373
00:23:35,985 --> 00:23:36,779
Which one?

374
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:43,216
Have a guess. Let's see if we have a heart connection.

375
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:07,072
You're always the favorite of mine

376
00:24:09,358 --> 00:24:10,972
Arrival of the Royal Order.

377
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,300
Consort Hua takes the order.

378
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,900
Receiving order of Emperor

379
00:24:22,024 --> 00:24:25,634
With god's wiliness, Emperor commands that

380
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:30,949
Consort Hua of Family Nian as the family pride with proper virtue

381
00:24:30,949 --> 00:24:35,230
Granting the title of Imperial Consort

382
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:37,395
End

383
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,428
Did Enuch make a mistake?

384
00:24:40,786 --> 00:24:43,419
Emperor granting me the title of Noble Consort?

385
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,700
Niang Niang, this Royal Order as handwritten by Emperor. There wouldn't be any mistakes for sure.

386
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,700
Congratulations to Noble Consort Hua.

387
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:04,397
But...but Imperial Household sent me an attire

388
00:25:04,427 --> 00:25:06,231
of Imperial Noble Consort before this

389
00:25:06,591 --> 00:25:11,867
That attire of Imperial Noble Consort belongs to Imperial Noble Consort Que-Hui of former Emperor.

390
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,500
Emperor is keeping it since there hasn't been any Imperial Noble Consort.

391
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,700
Now that Emperor wanted to make one for future use

392
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:25,387
But it was mistakenly sent here. Niang Niang please send it back to us.

393
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,100
Song-Zhi

394
00:25:28,215 --> 00:25:29,161
Yes

395
00:25:29,498 --> 00:25:30,933
Give it back to them.

396
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,400
Understood.

397
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,600
Niang Niang

398
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:38,893
You're the first and only Noble Consort in this Dynasty.

399
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,700
How prestigious! You need not worry about rankings

400
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,700
With the military influence of your family

401
00:25:46,802 --> 00:25:49,465
and love of the Emperor

402
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,823
Everything seems in fine condition.

403
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,130
With the authority of the back palace in your hand.

404
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,889
Isn't it more formal and official

405
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,625
When you have a prince in the future?

406
00:25:58,062 --> 00:25:59,476
Thanks for your words

407
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,915
Your servant takes his leave.

408
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:20,749
Congratulations to Imperial Consort.

409
00:26:21,272 --> 00:26:22,520
All of you may take your leave.

410
00:26:23,246 --> 00:26:24,825
There will be chances to congratulate me

411
00:26:25,073 --> 00:26:26,476
once the ceremony is over.

412
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,951
Yes.

413
00:26:36,014 --> 00:26:37,268
Madam.

414
00:26:37,882 --> 00:26:41,030
The emperor needs to take care of the empress's needs.

415
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:44,561
And the dowager's reputation.

416
00:26:45,953 --> 00:26:49,197
Its just a delusional dream of mine.

417
00:27:03,804 --> 00:27:04,676
<br>

418
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:09,814
Sister.

419
00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:11,351
I have some Boluchun tea, great for cooling your body down.

420
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,516
Have a cup then.

421
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,711
Consort Hua,

422
00:27:20,227 --> 00:27:21,784
<br>

423
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,224
<br>

424
00:27:26,116 --> 00:27:28,793
Great,

425
00:27:29,151 --> 00:27:31,469
What a waste that I do not have a good father,

426
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:33,830
and brother to fight in the battle field.

427
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:36,101
Now that is slut is gaining all the advantages.

428
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:39,295
Sister need not be angry.

429
00:27:39,728 --> 00:27:43,270
Now that Imperial Consort Hua is in power now,

430
00:27:44,468 --> 00:27:46,312
I feel that she looks like the former Imperial Consort Wen-Xi.

431
00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:49,581
Imperial Consort Wen-Xi?

432
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:51,142
She was the mother of Prince Dun.

433
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:53,285
Daughter of E-bilong.

434
00:27:54,463 --> 00:27:57,153
Biological sister of Zhao Hao-Ren.

435
00:27:57,585 --> 00:28:00,423
E-bilong is only powerful because of his master Oboi.

436
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:04,308
Even Emperor Kangxi could not tolerate him, not to mention Nian Gengyao.

437
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:09,295
<br>

438
00:28:09,786 --> 00:28:13,463
I have heard of it too, Nian Geng Yao's domineering act.

439
00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:21,233
But the emeperor is taking this too lightly.

440
00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:24,983
He even praised General Nian.

441
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,632
It takes a lot of effort to remove the root of the problem.

442
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:31,312
The longer it takes, the cleaner it will be.

443
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:34,535
Peace is just around the corner.

444
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,596
But Sister seems to be

445
00:28:39,422 --> 00:28:41,711
giving his majesty the cold shoulder lately.

446
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,310
How could I ingratiate the emperor?

447
00:28:43,544 --> 00:28:46,591
Emperor just sees me as somone unimportant.

448
00:28:46,946 --> 00:28:49,973
<br>

449
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,193
You will be looked down upon if you're disfavored.

450
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:55,672
You've been through it before.

451
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,044
<br>

452
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:22,140
Its obvious that Consort Hua is soley favored by the emperor.

453
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:24,777
All of us combined is nothing compared to yours.

454
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:27,375
You're emperor's favorite for sure.

455
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:30,976
Your highness must be teasing me.

456
00:29:31,285 --> 00:29:33,062
Since emperor favors me,

457
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:35,735
I must do my best to serve his Majesty.

458
00:29:35,783 --> 00:29:38,305
I'm glad to have you taking care of the emperor.

459
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:42,634
Since you are so love by the emperor, its time

460
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:44,234
you give him a little prince.

461
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:48,235
That's right.

462
00:29:48,271 --> 00:29:50,161
But it will be really awful

463
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:52,836
if its just a princess.

464
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:55,552
Consort Qi's words sure are blunt.

465
00:29:55,611 --> 00:29:57,437
If its a prince of high intelligence,

466
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:01,792
a celebration will most definitely be arranged. But if its a dumb headed prince,

467
00:30:02,312 --> 00:30:03,848
it would not be in favor at all.

468
00:30:04,195 --> 00:30:04,583
<br>

469
00:30:04,668 --> 00:30:05,356
It might even disgust the emperor.

470
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:08,951
You..<br> Enough.

471
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:10,757
It doesn't matter if he's intelligent or dumb.

472
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:15,253
It all depends on how you educate the child. The most important thing right now

473
00:30:16,156 --> 00:30:19,536
is to give birth to a healthy boy. <br> You should learn from Consort Hua,

474
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:23,860
look how blissful she is. <br> It doesn't matter if its a prince or princess

475
00:30:23,896 --> 00:30:27,489
I liked both.

476
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:34,308
How nice would it be if it turned out to be like Princess Wen-Yi.<br>Consort Qi, look, even Consort Wan

477
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,184
knows that its better than 3rd prince. <br> Consort Qi,

478
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:43,490
that's not what I meant. <br> What do you mean then?

479
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:48,820
Lady Fucha lost her baby the moment you're pregnant.

480
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,246
Are you trying to show off? Are you trying to

481
00:30:53,288 --> 00:30:57,131
put 3rd prince in bad light after causing the death of Lady Fucha's baby?

482
00:30:57,163 --> 00:31:00,690
Enough.

483
00:31:08,023 --> 00:31:11,844
Since you're holding on to such a prestigious status,

484
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:15,823
and the mother of 3rd prince, why did you make a fuss with the rest?

485
00:31:15,852 --> 00:31:18,642
How embarassing. <br> I have no intention

486
00:31:18,642 --> 00:31:21,773
to argue with Consort Wan. I am the

487
00:31:21,826 --> 00:31:24,896
mother of 3rd prince. How can I not take

488
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:29,291
his side? <br> You're his biological mother, I've watched him grow up too.

489
00:31:33,498 --> 00:31:36,424
I know that

490
00:31:36,424 --> 00:31:41,966
I am no longer attractive, and his majesty no longer favors me.

491
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:45,690
Its alright if I'm disfavored.

492
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:50,420
But 3rd prince is still his majesty's eldest son. <br>You've been serving him all these years,

493
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:55,022
why would he dislike you? 3rd prince is his majesty's

494
00:31:55,102 --> 00:31:59,027
only grown son after all.

495
00:31:59,058 --> 00:32:04,094
can never catch up with it. But come to think of it,

496
00:32:04,163 --> 00:32:07,621
now that Consort Wan is being favored and sharing the same

497
00:32:07,689 --> 00:32:13,155
background as yours. Her child might be the same level as

498
00:32:13,155 --> 00:32:19,421
3rd prince in the future.<br>Didn't empress Shunz Zhi insist that

499
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:24,829
4th prince to be crowned prince back then? But don't worry, I will persuade emperor

500
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:27,955
for sure if he insist on grating the newborn.

501
00:32:28,022 --> 00:32:31,045
Didn't empress Shun Zhi's prince died when he was till an infant?

502
00:32:31,097 --> 00:32:36,758
Poor thing.

503
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:38,890
Perhaps not being born was a better option than death.

504
00:32:41,222 --> 00:32:45,154
Oh bless me, how could I have spoke of such sinful words.

505
00:33:05,689 --> 00:33:09,021
Greetings Consort Qi.

506
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,254
Madam,

507
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:16,287
<br>

508
00:33:16,352 --> 00:33:21,421
What's the matter? <br> Pardon my words,

509
00:33:21,455 --> 00:33:25,229
please don't stand under the Oleander tree.

510
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:29,694
The pollen and fluid of the Oleander tree are poisonous.

511
00:33:29,694 --> 00:33:38,021
It'll be bad if madam accidentally consumes it.<br> Really?<br> Yes, thank goodness

512
00:33:38,097 --> 00:33:44,268
that there are no Oleander tress in the area where Sister Wan is living. Or else it will be bad for

513
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,688
her since she is pregnant now.

514
00:33:46,688 --> 00:33:50,154
How bad is it? <br> Oleander

515
00:33:50,222 --> 00:33:54,231
is bad for pregnancy. Back in my home town, pregnant women stay away from it.

516
00:33:57,813 --> 00:34:00,561
Miss,

517
00:34:00,648 --> 00:34:03,630
its almost time to greet the empress.

518
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:06,684
Let's hurry along. <br> I will be taking my leave now.

519
00:34:21,647 --> 00:34:25,322
Look how thick my waist is.

520
00:34:25,353 --> 00:34:27,885
I've gained a lot of weight too.

521
00:34:27,888 --> 00:34:32,624
Take a seat quickly. What's with all the weight?

522
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:36,156
Your baby is not even 4 months old.

523
00:34:36,156 --> 00:34:39,591
Others may not see it, but I do know that this baby in my belly

524
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:44,430
is growing day by day. <br> Indeed, its summer already.

525
00:34:47,488 --> 00:34:50,023
I remember Chun-Er,

526
00:34:50,023 --> 00:34:54,228
liked Phoenxi flowers a lot.

527
00:34:54,228 --> 00:34:57,555
I went to Bao Hua temple earlier on,

528
00:34:57,598 --> 00:35:01,494
to pray for Lady Chun.

529
00:35:01,522 --> 00:35:03,921
Its too bad that I'm pregnant,

530
00:35:04,689 --> 00:35:07,091
or else I would have personally give her my blessings.

531
00:35:07,091 --> 00:35:11,971
So that I could take revenge on her behalf.<br> Now that you're pregnant, how can you say such words?

532
00:35:13,022 --> 00:35:15,242
It will be bad if the baby hears it.

533
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:19,334
Your throat has not recovered.

534
00:35:19,352 --> 00:35:22,251
It will be bad if you catch a cold on the way.

535
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:26,167
I'm alright.

536
00:35:26,244 --> 00:35:31,556
I'm feeling better after talking to you. <br> Speaking of which,

537
00:35:31,556 --> 00:35:35,097
I've been feeling unwell lately.<br> Didn't Imperial doctor Zhang

538
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:40,554
prescribe you some Ramulus soup? Ramulus can help in smoothing your throat.

539
00:35:40,627 --> 00:35:43,922
Its the best for calming down.<br> I've been drinking it everyday.

540
00:35:47,843 --> 00:35:50,622
Miss,

541
00:35:50,669 --> 00:35:53,495
Consort Qi has send someone over.

542
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:56,552
Exactly.

543
00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:06,634
Greetings to Consort Wan

544
00:36:06,687 --> 00:36:08,844
and Lady An.<br> Rise.

545
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:14,103
Yes madam. Consort Qi made some chestnut cake and had me send them over.

546
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:16,644
Please have a try Consort Wan.<br> Thank madam on my behalf.

547
00:36:27,095 --> 00:36:29,231
Your servant will be taking her leave now.

548
00:36:34,687 --> 00:36:38,196
This came just in time.

549
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:44,493
Ling-Rong, have a try. The best snacks from the Qi Feng palace, I wonder how

550
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,259
would Consort Qi's snacks taste.

551
00:36:47,325 --> 00:36:51,022
Wait. Don't eat this.

552
00:36:51,124 --> 00:36:56,135
Why?

553
00:36:56,155 --> 00:37:00,687
Chestnut Cake should taste sweet. <br> Why do I smell a tinge of bitterness?

554
00:37:12,556 --> 00:37:14,558
Put it down.

555
00:37:14,673 --> 00:37:18,687
This snack has Oleander

556
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:24,623
fluid in it. <br> This... <br> Oleander is poisonous.

557
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:28,686
It helps in removing stasis. But everyone know that your chest has been feeling stuffy lately.

558
00:37:31,912 --> 00:37:35,905
Matching Oleander and Ramulus,

559
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:39,038
brings great effect for removing stasis. Its bad for your pregnancy.

560
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,087
The palace maid said that this was made by Consort Qi just now?

561
00:37:46,108 --> 00:37:51,823
Yes. Consort Qi must have been jealous of you being favored and pregnant.

562
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:56,286
That's why she did this.<br> I must let the emperor know about this.

563
00:37:56,323 --> 00:37:59,568
Please be seated.

564
00:38:00,754 --> 00:38:07,728
If the emperor knows about this, he will be mad at Consort Qi.

565
00:38:07,762 --> 00:38:12,361
As the eldest son of the empress, her highness would protect 3rd prince.

566
00:38:12,438 --> 00:38:18,562
Even though she cares nothing for Consort Qi. 3rd prince is also the eldest, once he takes the throne,

567
00:38:18,623 --> 00:38:22,956
he'll definitely give you a hard time. How are you going to survive then?

568
00:38:25,224 --> 00:38:27,756
I can't let go of this easily.

569
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:36,902
Bring these to Imperial Doctor Zhang.

570
00:38:36,987 --> 00:38:39,754
I'll make my decision later.<br> Take it away Liu-Zhu.

571
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:54,453
Have you send the snacks Consort Wan?

572
00:38:54,555 --> 00:39:00,083
Yes, I could stay long enough

573
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:05,419
to see Consort Wan finish it. <br> Strange... the effect should have taken place by now.

574
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:08,298
Could I have added

575
00:39:08,298 --> 00:39:11,021
too little of it? <br> Don't be anxious Madam, lets wait a little longer.

576
00:39:15,184 --> 00:39:17,181
Greetings

577
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:23,219
Consort Qi<br> Excused. <br> Madam, empress has summoned you

578
00:39:23,263 --> 00:39:29,761
to the palace of great benevolence. <br> The empress should be taking her afternoon nap now.

579
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:35,100
What's the matter? <br> There must be something urgent for sure.

580
00:39:47,336 --> 00:39:49,692
Greetings your highness.

581
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:54,155
Why is your highness not taking a nap? Even the palace maids are not around.

582
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:58,230
Kneel down.
