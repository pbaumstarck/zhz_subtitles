1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Episode 29

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,900
Kneel.

3
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:15,957
I did not leave anyone here is to help salvage your reputation.

4
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:19,083
If word gets out

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,761
there will be no place for your corpse.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,700
What is it that you speak of your highness?
 I do not understand.

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,800
You don't understand?

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,000
You sent this plate of chestnut sweets to Wan Pin,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,200
what is hidden inside of it?

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,700
I did send a plate of this desert to Wan Pin,<br> but it was out of good will.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,500
Good will?

12
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:44,917
I have already asked the imperial doctor Zhang, the sweets were filled with oleander powder.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,000
Oleander is poisonous.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,600
I did not know.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,500
You dare lie to me?

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,700
Who went to check the prescription for post pregnancy from the doctors?

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,300
You knew Wan Pin was taking cinnamon tea!

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,400
Oleander added with cinnamon

19
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:03,996
that is a combination for abortion.

20
00:01:11,847 --> 00:01:13,986
You were not careless at all.

21
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:17,584
You had intentions to kill Wang Pin's child.

22
00:01:17,584 --> 00:01:21,814
Your highness, I only have 3 brothers and a son

23
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:24,193
I cannot not make plans for his future.

24
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:27,788
So what? Even if Wan Pin gives birth to a boy,

25
00:01:27,827 --> 00:01:30,355
the child is still young. What are you afraid of?

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,100
I must be afraid.

27
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,652
I have already fallen into disfavor

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,300
3rd prince is not loved by his majesty

29
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,700
if he does not become the heir to the throne, then he will not have a future.

30
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,000
You're foolish.

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,300
Did you really think that you are helping 3rd prince? <br>You're lucky that I found out about this early.

32
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,300
Do you think the emperor will let you off if you really did kill Wan Pin's unborn child?

33
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,600
His majesty will think of his evil mother the moment he sees 3rd prince.

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,300
3rd prince is the one who truly has no hope.

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,200
Your highness, I was careless. <br>It was really a moment of carelessness!

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,900
You were careless of course.

37
00:02:11,953 --> 00:02:14,993
You're lucky that I was told of this earlier.

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,032
I have kept it under wraps for you.

39
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,017
Or else, did you think that you can still speak in front of me like this?

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,400
Does Wan Pin know about this?

41
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,400
She naturally knows.

42
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:27,743
She is even in a hurry to speak with his majesty about it.

43
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:29,948
Luckily, I was there to stop her.

44
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,000
And promised her a punishment for you,

45
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:35,712
only then did she agreed to hold back.

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,700
Thank you your highness.

47
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,100
But.. I did not really cause any harm to her.

48
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,200
She didn't eat it anyway.

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,200
You already have the idea of harming her

50
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,900
and you even did it.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,800
The only difference is Wan Pin not consuming it and harming her child.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,200
That's not because her luck, its you.

53
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,500
How could 3rd prince have such a foolish mother to commit such a foolish act.

54
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,200
I will clean this up nicely for you.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But for sake of shutting Wan Pin's mouth,

56
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:13,465
I have no choice but to implement harsh punishment upon you

57
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,900
Other than studying in Chong Hua palace,

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,200
3rd prince is not allowed to go to Chang Chun palace.

59
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,000
Your highness...

60
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,500
There is no doubt that you are 3rd prince's mother,<br> but a punishment is unavoidable.

61
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,400
In the future, I will discipline 3rd prince in your place,

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,300
there is no need for you to be at Chang Chun palace.

63
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,300
No.. your highness...

64
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,600
Your highness...

65
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:39,921
I cannot live without 3rd prince.

66
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't worry,

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,600
I will not cut off your mother and child ties.

68
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,500
Come to Jing Ren palace if you wish to see him.

69
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,600
If anyone word were to be out in the future,

70
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,800
I at least something to say to the public, or in the least protected you.

71
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,400
Its only natural that you're rejecting,

72
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,900
it would be impossible for you to see 3rd prince if Wan Pin makes a fuss.

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Thank you your highness.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,600
Young master has been exposed to shock, its best that you turn in early.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank goodness that I have Ling Rong here.

76
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,100
if she did not detect the scent of oleander...

77
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,100
Lin Rong did put her heart into it.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,600
I have shunned away from her in the past thinking that she is over sensitive,

79
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,600
but come to think of it now, it's my fault.

80
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,000
You can't put it that way either.

81
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,400
Only time will reveal one's true character.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,900
Peasant have heard from her highness has already implemented punishment on her.

83
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,288
They say that they will personally take care of 3rd prince.

84
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,500
To a mother

85
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,800
a mother and child separating is the most painful.

86
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,900
Her Highness has dealt with this harshly.

87
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,300
Oh well, as long as it will be left alone.

88
00:04:57,327 --> 00:05:00,570
Hopefully it can really be left alone for the best.

89
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,300
There was already the problem of investigating Fu Precious

90
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,600
I don't want the Emperor to worry anymore

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,200
I just believe that if some events were to occur again

92
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:11,369
with the same cycle

93
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
yesterday it was you tomorrow it is her

94
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,642
everyone getting hurt and hurting each other

95
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,800
It's like a strange cycle, it really is terrifying.

96
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,732
The Harem's ”kill or get killed" behavior will never end

97
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:28,983
so my lady you must take many precautions

98
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,200
I have thought about it for two nights and am still uneasy

99
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,730
So I asked you to come talk with me

100
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,600
yes

101
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,500
You have suffered from Noble Consort Qi's situation

102
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
But it can't be helped

103
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:47,542
The Emperor can focus on the Imperial Court only if his harem is harmonious

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,700
Noble Consort Qi's problem has affected everyone

105
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,100
Even 3rd prince will be implicated.<br> 4th prince and 5th prince are still young.

106
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,300
If this is known by people who have hidden agendas

107
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,600
unfortunately it will be another mighty uproar

108
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,700
Thankfully Ling Rong discovered it soon

109
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,400
Otherwise neither I nor my baby would have been lucky

110
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,000
An Chang Zai is meticulous,

111
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:13,303
so with her by your side I am able to rest assured

112
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,200
This time it will serve as a warning

113
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,300
From now on you must be extremely careful

114
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,700
I will definitely be very cautious

115
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,200
This year has been different from others

116
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:28,078
I wonder what has disturbed the balance

117
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,000
I hear from the Emperor that some lands are suffering from a drought

118
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,600
It has been two months without a drop of rain

119
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,000
This is devastating for the agricultural plans

120
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,500
Troubled Heavens means human suffering

121
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,279
Both the Imperial Court and the Harem are restless

122
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:45,496
The Emperor and Empress have worried

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,400
The Emperor and I have decided to go to Tian Tan to pray for rain

124
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,415
Then go to Gan Lu temple to pray for good fortune

125
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:58,003
Noble Consort Hua will be completely in charge of the Harem

126
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,900
Consort Jing will assist

127
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,500
I will rest for my baby

128
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,100
and won't go out unless there is a problem

129
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,200
That is good

130
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,900
You understand Noble Consort Hua's personality

131
00:07:09,948 --> 00:07:11,599
Bear with it if you can

132
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,100
Wait for the Emperor and I to come back to give you justice

133
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:19,113
But you are pregnant so she won't dare to do anything to you

134
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:21,711
You can just rest at ease

135
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,200
The trip will only take ten days

136
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:25,974
we will be back very soon

137
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,000
Thank you for your concern

138
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:31,145
I will definitely take good care of myself

139
00:07:31,153 --> 00:07:32,596
Good

140
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,100
How is your wound?

141
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,900
An Chang Zai presented a soothing balm.

142
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:42,111
I have used it since and indeed my wound has healed

143
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,900
If it is helping then you should use it often

144
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:48,113
A girl should never leave any kind of scar

145
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,000
You must fully recover

146
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,409
Thank you Empress

147
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,568
Jie Jie has returned

148
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,300
You came at the perfect time. I wanted to talk to you

149
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,600
The soothing balm is almost gone, I wanted to ask you for more

150
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,000
What a coincidence, I was thinking the same

151
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:06,190
See, I brought it with me

152
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,800
Sorry for imposing

153
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,300
I've already used three or four boxes

154
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:11,751
And I will continue to bother you and ask you to do this

155
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,000
Jie Jie is pregnant, quickly, sit

156
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,200
I have nothing better to do

157
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,400
Doing things I like for Jie Jie is a wonderful thing

158
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,300
You haven't fully recovered from your Laryngeal disease. <br>You must rest and not strain yourself.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,700
The Emperor has arrived

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,300
Huan Huan

161
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,000
Good fortune for your majesty

162
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,400
Get up

163
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

164
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,900
I told you not to carelessly move around

165
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,500
Yet you still greet me

166
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,400
What if you fell in a hurry to get up?

167
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:46,841
I'm not that fragile

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
Have you been well these few days?

169
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:52,120
I feel fatigued. My back and legs are sore

170
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,000
But the doctors said that because it is my first pregnancy, <br> feeling tired is a normal symptom.

171
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,600
Then has imperial doctor Wen come to examine Jie Jie?

172
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:00,822
No

173
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,100
Doctor Wen is busy with epidemiology and takes care of Mei Jie Jie

174
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,000
My pregnancy is being cared for by imperial doctor Zhang

175
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,300
Then, with the Emperor at Jie Jie's side

176
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,200
I will take my leave first

177
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,100
The Empress and I will go to Tian Alter to pray

178
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,200
The palace will be overseen by Consort Hua

179
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,000
You two don't get along well. If there are conflicts you must give in to her

180
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,100
If you have any grievances tell me when I return

181
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,300
Yes

182
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,521
There is another urgent matter

183
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,200
As you are pregnant, to avoid troubles don't go to Yi Kun Palace

184
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,100
I will be careful. Please don't worry

185
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,000
Because I am worried I keep telling you

186
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,300
Shi Lan is competitive has a quick mouth but she isn't a bad person

187
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,300
You are worrying about this and that

188
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:09,328
Just take in fewer concubines and it will be fine

189
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,444
Splitting a heart into so many parts

190
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,700
Just watching it seems exhausting

191
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,600
If I wasn't the emperor and a wealthy prince instead,<br> the Empress as the wife

192
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,300
and you with Shi Lan as my consorts,<br> that would be satisfactory

193
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,100
Noble Consort Hua

194
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,200
All of the palace's duties have been given to you

195
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,600
You must take good care of everything

196
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,100
I will follow the Emperor's orders

197
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,000
Lower the sedan chair

198
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,100
Raise the sedan chair

199
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,200
The Emperor and Empress are leaving

200
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,100
Sending the Emperor and Empress away

201
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,300
On this trip to pray Empress it the only one serving the Emperor

202
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,500
Perhaps wishing for rain from the heavens isn't the only goal

203
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,400
Empress will be satisfied only if her wish for a son will come true

204
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,200
Concubine Wan don't you agree?

205
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,400
If the Empress really becomes pregnant, Noble Consort will be happy too right?

206
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,800
Of course

207
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,600
I believe that Concubine Wan will be happy as well

208
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,800
Empress is the mother of the country.<br> If she bears a son that is the nation's fortune,

209
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,000
Naturally no one will be unhappy

210
00:12:13,283 --> 00:12:16,659
Concubine Wan has gotten better at speaking

211
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,500
Concubine Wan is pregnant and shouldn't stand outside for too long. <br>Let's return to the palace.

212
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,300
Consort Jing may share some powers with me

213
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,400
But a consort is a consort, a noble consort is a noble consort

214
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,400
There is only a one word difference yet it differentiates the two ranks

215
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,400
The one of lower status must obey the other

216
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,000
Consort Jing do you understand?

217
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,800
Yes

218
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,100
I served the Emperor before you. <br>When I was his first rank concubine, you were only a Gege

219
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,100
Maybe if you have luck there will be a day in the future when you are my equal

220
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,700
You must remember that you are a person from my palace

221
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,100
In front of me, if I have not spoken,<br> you have no right to speak

222
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,100
Understand?

223
00:13:07,127 --> 00:13:08,681
yes

224
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,200
The weather is hot. Sisters let's disperse

225
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,100
Hurry, help her sit

226
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,300
Zhang Mi greets the two concubines

227
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:38,301
Rise

228
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,641
Thank you

229
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,800
You came at the right time. Consort Wan doesn't look well. Hurry and look at her

230
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,300
Yes. I was just about to examine her pulse

231
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,400
Niang Niang you only went out for a bit why is your face so pale?

232
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,100
Just now when I was standing in the sun it was a bit hot but not I am better

233
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,300
You have indeed suffered from the heat

234
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,100
but it isn't significant

235
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,600
However, if I may ask, do you frequently feel anxious?

236
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,100
Ever since Precious Chun's death she has been grieving

237
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,500
Her fetus hasn't been affected

238
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,200
But as pregnant woman, feeling depressed will not be good for the fetus

239
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,500
You must have a more open heart

240
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,200
Thank you imperial doctor

241
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,900
During the summer it is hot and your body may be weak

242
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,500
Avoid walking around when the sun is strong and focus on resting

243
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,100
Thank you imperial doctor

244
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,500
Liu Zhu, please see imperial doctor Zhang out

245
00:15:05,483 --> 00:15:07,290
Thank you Niang Niang

246
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:21,200
Master, even though doctor Zhang knows what he's doing, servant has still according to tradition

247
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,200
should take the prescription and let doctor Wen look at it okay?

248
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,700
Have you forgotten? Doctor Wen went with the Emperor to serve him

249
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,300
Doctor Zhang's medicine had been looked at doctor Wen before, it's fine

250
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh

251
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm grateful to Jie Jie for just now, thank you

252
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,600
It's nothing really

253
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,700
Living with her before, I've heard everything and suffered through it all

254
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:54,602
I'm used to it. But you saw what happened just now

255
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,300
Even if I want to protect you

256
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,400
I really am powerless

257
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Thankfully the Emperor will return soon

258
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:04,157
I believe that nothing significant will occur

259
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,100
I'm grateful for Jie Jie's caring intentions. Thank you

260
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,100
Emperor and Empress left the palace while Empress Dowager is ill

261
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,700
This palace is now your's

262
00:16:18,955 --> 00:16:20,194
Oh yes

263
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,800
What a rare opportunity. It is the perfect time to deal with those who need it

264
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,200
I'm sleepy. Go light my Huan Yi incense.

265
00:16:36,337 --> 00:16:37,310
Yes

266
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,000
Master, the medicine is ready

267
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,200
No matter how long I sleep I'm still tired. My hip is so sore

268
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
What is wrong, master?

269
00:17:06,104 --> 00:17:07,545
It's nothing

270
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,300
I'm guessing it's these past few days I've been going to Noble Consort Hua's palace to listen to her talk

271
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
and getting tired so I would become like this

272
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,700
Really, she has no reason but keeps asking people to go over to talk to her

273
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,700
In one sitting it is six to eight hours and she doesn't feel tired

274
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,400
Her status is high and powerful. Before we would stay with Empress and talk

275
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,100
Now we have to stay with her

276
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,300
And I don't know what kind of incense she uses

277
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,500
I've always thought it was pungent

278
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,100
Hua Niang Niang loves to use insense

279
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,500
and makes it strong. It can be smelled from far away

280
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,200
Master has been saying these past few days your body feels sore

281
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,700
Maybe you should drink some warm water and rest a bit

282
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,700
Servant will tell Xiao Yun Zi to ask for an imperial doctor

283
00:17:48,137 --> 00:17:49,509
Go quick and return quickly.

284
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,100
Okay

285
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,100
Servant greets Imperial Concubine Wan

286
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,800
Rise

287
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,962
A message from Noble Consort Hua: Please send Wan Niang Niang to Yi Kun palace to talk

288
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,700
It's not that I don't want to but today my body does not feel well

289
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,100
Could you pass this on to Noble Consort?

290
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Noble Consort Hua is acting on Emperor's orders and supervising the Harem

291
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,000
Can't you see my master isn't feeling well?

292
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,100
A few days ago even the Empress said that master is pregnant

293
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,800
and the daily greetings could be waived

294
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:29,200
compared to now when she isn't feeling good. Even if the Empress was her she wouldn't have to go

295
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,700
Noble Consort Hua understands that Niang Niang's body is weak right now

296
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:34,904
and especially sent servant to invite you

297
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,200
If you don't go then how is Noble Consort going to handle the Harem?

298
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:44,600
Supervising the Harem is the Emperor's order. Niang Niang you must not disobey the Emperor

299
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,100
Gong Gong has a point but today I am not feeling well

300
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,100
I really can't go

301
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,000
Consort Duan's body is in that condition so obviously can't attend

302
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,400
But all the other concubines are there. Even An Chang. They are all waiting for you

303
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,000
Master, how about you go after the imperial doctor has looked at you?

304
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:18,400
Imperial Concubine Wan should just go. Don't be late and make Niang Niang angry which is bad for everyone

305
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
You can go outside and wait

306
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,800
I will go after I change

307
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,200
Great, then servant will be outside waiting

308
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,500
Niang Niang has already sent Zhou Ning Hai to invite her, Imperial Consort Wan will definitely come

309
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Even the Empress has to concede to me, I don't believe that she has the nerve to not come

310
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:46,000
Actually Niang Niang doesn't have to deal with her right now, there is plenty of time

311
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:49,978
In order to crush someone you must do it at their most satisfactory moment

312
00:19:50,061 --> 00:19:56,436
As of now she is proud because of her pregnancy. I will use this time to deal her a severe blow

313
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,600
I will let her know that in front of me there can only be those who serve him

314
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,400
There cannot be anyone who is doted on by the Emperor

315
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,100
Even more it can't be someone who is fighting me to get his love

316
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,400
Niang Niang everyone has arrived and now are waiting for you

317
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,500
Master, can you not go?

318
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,200
When the Emperor and Empress left the cautioned me to endure it

319
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,000
If I don't go who knows what kind of drama will erupt

320
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,300
Everyone is there, I don't think anything will happen

321
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,600
Then I will go with master

322
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,500
Let's go

323
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,400
Empress Dowager has been ill these few days and has been thinking about Prince and Prince has come

324
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,100
Is Empress Dowager's illness better?

325
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,300
It's still the same. She coughs every night and cannot get a good night's rest

326
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,400
You wait out here, Jin Xi will accompany me.

327
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,100
Yes

328
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,500
Greetings to Noble Consort. I wasn't feeling well so I arrived late.

329
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Please forgive me.

330
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,000
Due to your pregnancy fatigue is unavoidable.

331
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,700
Please rise.

332
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,100
This rose flavored cake is one of the tastiest delicacies

333
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,100
yet after smelling the fragrant incense in your palace the cake seems flavorless

334
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,700
Forgive my boldness, but what scent does Noble Consort use?

335
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,500
An Chang's smelling sense is very strong.

336
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:25,964
The Emperor had experts specially create it for me.

337
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,300
It's called "Happily Desirable" and in this palace only I can use it

338
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,000
My knowledge is limited

339
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,100
and have not seen as much as Noble Consort.

340
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,100
An sister came to serve the Emperor later than you, naturally she wouldn't know

341
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:47,265
When the Emperor was only a Lord he only allowed Noble Consort to use the "Happily Desirable" incense

342
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,500
Of which includes the Ambergris scent. It was given passed down from the previous emperor.

343
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,800
The Emperor divided it in half and used it to make Noble Consort's incense.

344
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,500
It's been a long time so why bring it up now?

345
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,300
Yes, I have spoken too much.

346
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,200
Today there were many maids and servants who were fighting.

347
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:15,800
During this opportunity it is time to clean up and straighten out the palace.

348
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,300
The maids and servants are bickering and fighting

349
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,100
It is all as a result of the young mistresses spoiling them.

350
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,200
If the servants are misbehaving it means that their masters aren't behaving properly.

351
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:38,200
Pi Ru Fu Cha Consort used her pregnancy to act all high and mighty.

352
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:45,300
If there is anyone who hasn't learned her lesson and follows the consort's footsteps

353
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,200
That would be such a pity. Imperial Concubine Wan.

354
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,200
Do you admit your crime?

355
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,800
Today all of the concubines came here to listen

356
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,200
You came here late, disrespecting me. Hurry up and kneel before me.

357
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,500
I admit my guilt. Just now I wanted to ask for forgiveness.

358
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,900
Today you've shown disrespect to those above you. Who knows how you will be if you bear a son.

359
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Does everyone have to follow you?

360
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,300
Although Noble Consort is angry, I can't help but say

361
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:46,100
but when Precious Fu Cha was pregnant the Emperor and Empress to special care of her. This wasn't for Precious Fu Cha.

362
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Rather it was for the ancestors. Today I had no intention to come here late.

363
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:59,300
Although I may have offended you the Empress Dowager and Empress are still above me. What you just said about the Harem

364
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,400
following me really makes me feel scared.

365
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:10,300
Noble Consort you've been talking so you must be thirsty. How about you have some tea and rest.

366
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:16,100
Imperial Concubine may be in the wrong but at least let her rise to talk.

367
00:25:16,205 --> 00:25:18,262
Women should behave like a housewife

368
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:26,200
You are trying to be clever and flagrantly disobeying rules and offended me. You will kneel outside my palace

369
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,500
as a punishment.

370
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:35,700
Niang Niang, the sun is strong outside and the ground is hard. Imperial Concubine is pregnant, she can't kneel there!

371
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,500
Noble Consort please forgive sister for the sake of her unborn child.

372
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:49,600
Niang Niang, punishing her is a small matter, but it harms the child the Emperor and Empress will surely punish you.

373
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,600
The rules aren't strict enough so I will correct it

374
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,300
If the Emperor and Empress were here it would also be this way.

375
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,700
Unless you want to use the Emperor and Empress to threaten me?

376
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,300
Niang Niang please keep the Emperor in your mind.

377
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,300
Imperial Concubine Wan. Will you walk out of here by yourself?

378
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,100
Or should I ask someone to give you a hand?

379
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,100
Imperial Concubine Wan. This way please.

380
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,200
Mother you don't look too well you must not do anything stressful. You must rest.

381
00:26:49,147 --> 00:26:52,148
How can I still do anything that requires my attention?

382
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:59,000
With the Emperor and Empress gone the Harem has been handed to Noble Consort Hua.

383
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,900
When the Emperor was only a lord she was already helping the Empress

384
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,000
and I'm sure she will do a good job and not have you worry.

385
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,100
Noble Consort Hua's personality is just like her brother's.

386
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,200
Capable of handling big responsibilities but also of doing bad deeds.

387
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,100
Your Highness, Official Long Ke Duo's household sent this thousand year ginseng in hopes that your body will heal.

388
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,400
You may leave it.

389
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,200
Have you heard what Noble Consort Hua's brother has been doing in the official court?

390
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:48,300
No wonder your body isn't doing well. You didn't listen to the imperial doctor's orders to not stress about anything.

391
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,100
Yet you are even concerning yourself with the political matters.

392
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,800
One you mention them, I have to go around asking for more information.

393
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,100
This time I will let it slide. But if it happens again then I will be afraid of coming inside the palace.

394
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,600
Oh child, you are speaking with that slick mouth of yours.

395
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,100
I accept my punishment.

396
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,100
But I am pregnant and seriously cannot kneel for a long time.

397
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Niang Niang please rethink it.

398
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,500
Do you take me for a fool?

399
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,100
You are doing well with your pregnancy and it has passed the dangerous first trimester.

400
00:28:23,277 --> 00:28:25,157
Your pregnancy has been stable for a while now.

401
00:28:25,825 --> 00:28:31,199
I have already asked the imperial doctors and kneeling for two hours won't be harmful.

402
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Kneel. <br> you can't!

403
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,500
Young miss!

404
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:50,200
The reason why I accept this is because the Emperor gave you the responsibility of supervising the harem.

405
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,200
Real justice is known within the hearts of the people and isn't determined

406
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,200
Okay.

407
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,600
We will see if justice is controlled in my hands

408
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,100
or in what you believe to be in people's hearts.

409
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,500
Read it well, until I am satisfied.

410
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,700
Imperial Concubine is pregnant! She really can't take kneeling.

411
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,100
Does being pregnant mean you can disobey the palace rules?

412
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,300
I think that you have forgotten the lesson you already learned.

413
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,200
Why don't you kneel with her instead of pleading for her?

414
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,100
Precious Hui isn't intentionally asking for my forgiveness. Please don't involve her as well.

415
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,300
If I really wanted to include her than what can you really do?

416
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:41,273
Aren't you two as close as sisters?

417
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,600
Fine then.

418
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:48,300
Kneel next to her and hold the book. Have her recite it and learn the rules properly.

419
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,200
I'll stay with you.

420
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,100
Oh it's so hot.

421
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,300
Bring the concubine's chairs out here.

422
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,600
So they can all watch

423
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,100
and see what the consequences are for defying me.

424
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,100
Even if it is a gorgeous woman sweating the smell is still pungent.

425
00:30:49,822 --> 00:30:53,462
In short, go put the incense over there.

426
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,100
Add a lot of "Happily Desirable" incense to get rid of the stink.

427
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,000
Noble Consort

428
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:29,169
If you dare to say another word then you will go kneel with her.

429
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,300
You can't go in.

430
00:31:35,118 --> 00:31:37,277
She has been kneeling for so long.

431
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,600
How come she still isn't allowed to get up?

432
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,000
Don't you know Noble Consort's personality?

433
00:31:41,157 --> 00:31:42,189
She punishes people whenever she wants to.

434
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,100
She is far from being done.

435
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:56,309
Who's there?

436
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,300
I am with Sui Yu Xuan and have urgent news to tell the Empress Dowager.

437
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,400
Her Highness isn't feeling well and took some medicine before sleeping. How dare you behave so noisily.

438
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,700
This has to do with someone's life! Please let me in.

439
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,900
Even if you can get through here you won't get inside to see her. If you disturb her it will cost more than a few lives.

440
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,100
Empress Dowager! <br> Get out of here

441
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,700
If you weren't from Sui Yu Xuan I'd already have beaten you do death. Get lost.

442
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:18,188
Eh? Huan Bi why are you here?

443
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,700
Ah Jin! Why are you here?

444
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,800
Why can't I be here? I came here with the lord.

445
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,200
Ah Jing, where's the lord?

446
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,200
Come here <br> Yes.

447
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:39,299
Hit.

448
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,100
If we can't hit the one with a baby then we will hit the one without one.

449
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,300
Yes.

450
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,800
No, you can't hit her!

451
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,200
Young miss be careful! You can't hit her.

452
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,500
Young miss!

453
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,200
Noble Consort

454
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,800
If you are lazy again then your sister will take the punishment in your place.

455
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,200
Niang Niang

456
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,100
My body really isn't feeling well.

457
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,200
Look at her you guys, she really is stupid.

458
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,100
Her acting as a sick person looks exactly like what Precious Fu Cha did

459
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,300
and doesn't even think how this excuse is so overused that everyone finds it annoying.

460
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,100
Why don't you change it?

461
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,800
Niang Niang, sister's body is weak

462
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:50,147
if she gets heatstroke and faints even you won't be able to endure the punishment.

463
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:54,244
I want to see if she really will faint.

464
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,700
Zhou Ning Hai. Go get some mint leaves.

465
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:58,461
Yes.

466
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,500
If she smells this and still faints

467
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,100
Then she will be lying to me.

468
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,800
If I can't punish you

469
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,700
I won't let Precious Hui or An Chang get away with it.

470
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,100
"The second couple"

471
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,200
"The road of the couple matches with Ying and Yang"

472
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,600
Niang Niang please forgive her. Please forgive sister.

473
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,400
Noble Consort. Niang Niang.

474
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,300
Niang Niang, it has already been an hour.

475
00:34:57,585 --> 00:35:00,503
No hurry, have her kneel for another half an hour.

476
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,200
If something happens you won't be able to take the responsibility either.

477
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,200
Niang Niang, Imperial Concubine's face is already pale.

478
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:17,074
Is her hypocritical acting just for me to see?

479
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,200
I think she looks perfectly fine.

480
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,100
Miss.

481
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,207
Miss!

482
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,300
Miss. Wan Er

483
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,100
Wan Er! <br> Young miss!

484
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,000
Go away

485
00:35:38,323 --> 00:35:39,183
Get off!

486
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,400
Young Miss. Young Miss

487
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,100
Lord Guo Jun!

488
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,300
Young miss what's wrong?

489
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
He dares to invade my palace

490
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,100
Stop! Where are you taking Imperial Concubine Wan?

491
00:35:51,536 --> 00:35:54,036
Don't you know that invading an interior palace is punishable by death?

492
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,200
Whether it's punishable by death or not is determined by my brother.

493
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,700
The reason why I intruded is because I don't want to see the Emperor's royal child be lost.

494
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:06,308
If someday he punishes me after listening to you talk I will have no regrets.

495
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,300
Stop right there!

496
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,900
Niang Niang, it looks like there's blood on the ground.

497
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,100
Niang Niang

498
00:36:22,384 --> 00:36:26,134
How can this be? Wasn't it just an hour?

499
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,400
How can there be blood?

500
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,900
Quick call for the doctor!

501
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,100
What happened? <br> The blankets!

502
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,200
Miss.

503
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,200
Imperial Concubine Wan.

504
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:57,400
Young miss. How can this happen?!

505
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,000
You! Go get some water. Yes

506
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,100
Lord, Emperor and Empress are at Tian Tan praying and I can't leave. Please take care of this in the Emperor's place!

507
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:16,200
Lord, your presence here may be awkward, I ask that you leave.

508
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,200
Miss.

509
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,400
Thank you lord.

510
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,100
Lord,

511
00:37:25,206 --> 00:37:26,239
Miss

512
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,400
Your highness thank you so much for your help.

513
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:35,100
Your miss will be in the care of your hands.

514
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:41,602
When you report to the Emperor may I ask you to tell him word for word what happened in Yi Kong Palace?

515
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,200
I will report everything to him with out forgetting anything.

516
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,300
Miss

517
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,300
Miss

518
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,100
The Harem is restless; the people's hearts are drifting.

519
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,200
The Emperor does not have many sons.

520
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:08,400
So please have mercy and help Imperial Concubine be able to safely deliver a son.

521
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,000
The Heavens will be moved by your generous heart.

522
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,200
I hope that she will be able to successfully give birth to a son.

523
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,300
One, so she can preserve the royal bloodline.

524
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,100
Two, so that 3rd Prince will have someone by his side.

525
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,200
Anyways, even though 3rd Prince has two younger brothers,

526
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,400
but they are being raised in a different place so naturally he would be lonely.

527
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,300
With you as the mother, I am able to rest my worries.

528
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,500
I am incapable.

529
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,200
I am unable to raise 1st Prince for you

530
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,200
and sister died after giving birth to 2nd Prince.

531
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,300
Us two sister have no luck and don't have any sons.

532
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,200
I just hope that the other sisters may be successful for you.

533
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,500
You are so virtuous. My heart is comforted.

534
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
Emperor Emperor!

535
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,900
What?

536
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,600
Emperor

537
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,800
Emperor.

538
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,200
Something has happened to Sui Yu Xuan.

539
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,100
What happened to Imperial Concubine Wan?

540
00:39:55,244 --> 00:39:59,880
Your Highness don't be impatient.The 17th lord will be here in a bit to explain everything to you.
