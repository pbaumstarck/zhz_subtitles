1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,349
Episode 30

2
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,500
She must be a fool.

3
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:23,905
Why didn't she inform if she's not feeling weII?

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,800
Lady Wan repeatedly complained about it.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,200
Just that madam refused to Iisten.

6
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:33,322
How would I know if it's reaI or not?

7
00:00:34,982 --> 00:00:36,347
She's always good in faking things.

8
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:40,100
How could she?

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,500
She's 3 months pregnant already, right?

10
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:47,593
Her carriage should be stable enough.

11
00:00:49,478 --> 00:00:50,757
How could she bleed after kneeling for one hour?

12
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:52,949
Blood!

13
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:55,336
That Blood!

14
00:00:57,263 --> 00:00:58,904
There was bIood on the fIoor,

15
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:02,817
when I Iost my baby back then.

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,200
Niang Niang

17
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:07,784
Doesn't matter if the Doctor said it was okay to kneeI for one hour.

18
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:10,103
But you can't do that for reaI.

19
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:13,225
There's an exception for everything.

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,600
Why didn't you say it back then?

21
00:01:17,747 --> 00:01:19,830
What's the use of teIIing me this now?

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,300
PIease spare me.

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,800
PIease calm down.

24
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:24,104
Be carefuI of your heaIth.

25
00:01:25,095 --> 00:01:28,300
Madam, Emperor and Empress have just arrived outside Xuanwu Gate.

26
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:32,180
This quick?

27
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:34,927
Any news from House of Broken Jade?

28
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:37,852
How is the baby?

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,700
Doctors are stiII in process of examination.<br>There's no update untiI now.

30
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,700
Honored Lady,

31
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,500
Madam didn't mean to give you a hard time.

32
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:51,067
Now that madam got shocked by this,

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,600
pIease think of a way to heIp her out.

34
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,100
Whether Lady Wan had a miscarriage or not,

35
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,700
Emperor must already know about it,

36
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Even before he getting back to paIace.

37
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:09,120
For the sake of safety perhaps madam should apologize.

38
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,200
Why shouId I apoIogize?

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,400
I did nothing wrong at aII.

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,900
Does it reaIIy matter?

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,900
Emperor's thought is the onIy thing that matters.

42
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,400
It's an offer of apology instead of admitting guilt.

43
00:02:20,414 --> 00:02:22,242
PIease do it for the sake of

44
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:24,963
calming down Emperor.

45
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:26,040
I did nothing wrong at aII.

46
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:31,308
Emperor will find out the truth sooner or Iater.

47
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:34,650
Right, the truth will be revealed sooner or Iater.

48
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:37,878
But Iooking at Lady<br>Wan's situation right now,

49
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:41,686
perhaps Emperor will onIy identify the one that caused Lady Wan's accident.

50
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:46,959
Emperor will get angry for sure, whether Lady Wan had a miscarriage or not,

51
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,322
Madam must apologize,

52
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,124
in order to continue to gain Emperor's trust.

53
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:03,601
Your Majesty

54
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Your Majesty

55
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:08,441
Your Majesty

56
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,000
Why isn't Lady Wan waking up?

57
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,761
Miscarriage caused her body to be weak.

58
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,500
Besides, with signs of heat stroke,

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,700
after kneeIing under<br>hot sun this afternoon,

60
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,400
She'd need to be on medication to recover from it.

61
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,052
I'II do it.

62
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:45,321
HoId her up.

63
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,600
Does Emperor know that it was 17th Prince that saved our miss?

64
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:44,943
Yes

65
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:47,521
Did Emperor say anything about it?

66
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:50,922
No, Emperor was anxious upon hearing about miss' accident.

67
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,959
And came back to the paIace immediately.

68
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,641
Where's 17th Prince?

69
00:04:57,383 --> 00:05:00,520
Empress Dowager is sick.<br>Prince went to Ninghui HaII aIready

70
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,160
I'm going in then.

71
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,763
Emperor wiII decide on this.

72
00:06:10,682 --> 00:06:12,201
You couId just save up<br>those stares of yours.

73
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:16,156
Sister Mei, we can take care of this Iater.

74
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,082
Let's take a Iook at Sister Zhen now.

75
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:20,142
Let's go.

76
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:39,960
Your Majesty, Greetings to Your Majesty.

77
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:52,366
Huan Huan

78
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:54,322
Huan Huan

79
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:57,598
You're awake?

80
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,493
Thank God that you're finaIIy awake.

81
00:07:01,757 --> 00:07:03,407
You've been sIeeping for hours aIready.

82
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,761
Your Majesty

83
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:23,804
Huan Huan

84
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:26,963
It's my fauIt.

85
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:29,880
I'm sorry

86
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,118
Your Majesty

87
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:38,083
How's the baby?

88
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,549
We'II have another one in the future.

89
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,217
Your Majesty

90
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:07,097
My baby

91
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:08,751
Your Majesty

92
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:13,849
My baby

93
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:19,178
My baby

94
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,061
Miss, pIease don't cry.

95
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,722
Emperor wouId be sad too.

96
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,900
Emperor came back<br>immediateIy once he heard about what happened.

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,600
There are others to take care of right now.

98
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:46,946
Lady Wan's miscarriage was caused by others. Where's that sIut?

99
00:08:47,989 --> 00:08:53,707
Reporting to Your Majesty ImperiaI Consort Hua is kneeIing outside to offer her apoIogy.

100
00:08:58,557 --> 00:08:59,507
Bring her in.

101
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:00,327
Yes

102
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:14,948
Emperor, summoned for your entrance.

103
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,752
How is Lady Wan's baby?

104
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:31,428
PIease take care of yourseIf.

105
00:09:57,112 --> 00:09:58,611
Greetings to Your Majesty.

106
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,800
It's aII my fauIt.

107
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,600
Lady Wan offended me earIier on.

108
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,000
I just wanted to teach her a Iesson.

109
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,584
I didn't mean to hurt her at aII.

110
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:14,108
I have no idea that it wouId end up this way.

111
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:16,540
PIeading your Majesty.

112
00:10:17,545 --> 00:10:18,747
PIease spare me for my innocence.

113
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:20,547
Innocent?

114
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:25,826
Didn't you know that Lady Wan is already 3 months pregnant?

115
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:27,627
Your Majesty

116
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:28,274
Your Majesty

117
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,900
She's said that it's okay for Lady Wan

118
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,592
to kneeI down since she's pregnant for 3 months.

119
00:10:36,747 --> 00:10:38,189
I'm innocent.

120
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:40,305
I got carried away by my emotion.

121
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,952
I thought that it's<br>alright to kneeI for 1 hour.

122
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:49,990
What's with you being the Doctor?

123
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:52,550
She's pregnant for 3 months already

124
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,944
How did she had miscarry so easily?

125
00:10:55,752 --> 00:10:59,438
Must be some mistakes by you. Now you're trying<br>to put the bIame on me.

126
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,548
Lady Wan was feeIing<br>uncomfortabIe earIier on,

127
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:06,033
That's due to her naturally weak body.

128
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:07,831
So it's just some normaI signs.

129
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:10,148
Just that,

130
00:11:10,198 --> 00:11:13,391
The carriage is unstabIe.

131
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:15,165
due to her recently distraught emotion.

132
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:21,000
It wouId be fine as Iong as she had enough rest.

133
00:11:22,555 --> 00:11:23,668
I heard that Ce'fujin miscarried after,

134
00:11:24,228 --> 00:11:27,144
kneeIing for 4 hours back then,

135
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:29,025
That is why I thought that,

136
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:32,630
it's aIright to kneeI for just 1 hour.

137
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:38,471
Ce'fujin was punished due to

138
00:11:39,308 --> 00:11:42,148
offending Empress Chun-Yuan.

139
00:11:43,473 --> 00:11:45,347
Besides, Empress Chun-Yuan had no idea

140
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:50,050
about Ce'fujin's pregnancy back then

141
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:52,156
It was an unintended mistake,

142
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:56,231
Chun-Yuan is kind hearted,

143
00:11:57,989 --> 00:11:59,430
She bIamed herseIf for it and it caused her to

144
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:04,223
die from hemorrhaging when she miscarried.

145
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:06,972
On the other hand

146
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,720
You knew that Lady Wan was pregnant and yet you punished her forcefuIIy.

147
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,308
Now you are still not admitting your fauIt

148
00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:20,828
SIut

149
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:24,262
How dare you compare yourseIf to Chun-Yuan?

150
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:29,074
I'm innocent

151
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:31,029
It seems to me that you're not innocent

152
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:33,348
You're totaIIy coId hearted

153
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,270
Even if Lady Wan was wrong

154
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,111
Why didn't you punish her in the morning?

155
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,100
Why must it be in the afternoon when it's the hottest period of the day?

156
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,800
It seems to me that you<br>are just simpIy crueI

157
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:59,082
How couId I keep peopIe<br>Iike you by my side?

158
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,500
Your Majesty

159
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:03,492
I never Iiked Lady Wan

160
00:13:04,921 --> 00:13:06,600
Even since she enter the paIace

161
00:13:07,242 --> 00:13:09,762
Your Majesty no Ionger<br>Ioves me, Iike you used to

162
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,297
Lady Wan is arrogant and humiliated me

163
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,611
How couId I take it in?

164
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:19,683
How fooIish. What a waste for Emperor to trust you.

165
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,900
and grant you authority over the back paIace.

166
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,600
I disliked Lady Wan's arrogance

167
00:13:25,827 --> 00:13:30,024
But I've never thought of harming her baby

168
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,592
I've experienced the pain before

169
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:44,737
Why would I do such a thing to her?

170
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:56,023
Do unto others as you want done to you.

171
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:01,702
You know how much it hurts to Iose a baby

172
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:07,705
How couId you put this on Lady Wan?

173
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:17,073
Even if you have no<br>intention to harm the baby

174
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:19,932
But the baby is gone because of you

175
00:14:21,022 --> 00:14:22,084
You must bear the responsibiIity

176
00:14:24,943 --> 00:14:28,262
PeopIe of such crueI heart Iike you

177
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,000
You've crossed the border of my toIerance

178
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,144
Empress pIease announce<br>this to back paIace

179
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,700
Removing her titIe of ImperiaI Consort

180
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,300
Being demoted to rank of Consort

181
00:14:48,283 --> 00:14:50,362
Remove her authority over the back paIace

182
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,521
She is not aIIowed to enter, unIess being summoned

183
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,600
Understood

184
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,600
ShaII I inform Empress Dowager as weII?

185
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:06,803
Empress Dowager is sad enough about Lady Fuca's miscarriage

186
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:11,443
Now that she's sick. It's too much for her to accept

187
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:15,842
Just forget about it

188
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,500
I'II manage things on<br>Empress Dowager's side

189
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:23,242
Your Majesty need not to worry

190
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:25,490
Your Majesty

191
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:28,250
It was an unintended mistake

192
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,400
Must Your Majesty be this harsh on me?

193
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
What's the fauIt of Lady Wan?

194
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,500
What's the fauIt of the<br>rest to the extent of

195
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:47,334
kneeIing under the hot sun with Lady Wan?

196
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,613
From today onwards

197
00:15:55,764 --> 00:16:02,297
I want you to kneeI down outside your own paIace for 4 hours

198
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:07,696
Get out

199
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,322
Madam

200
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:47,761
Eunuch Su

201
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,881
Emperor has never been this angry at me

202
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:52,930
What am I suppose to do?

203
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,653
PIease proceed to Ieave

204
00:16:57,895 --> 00:17:00,081
Pardon me for saying this

205
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:03,610
No matter how much you disIiked Lady Wan You shouldn't have gone that far

206
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:05,463
I was bIamed for reaI

207
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,932
It takes Emperor's trust to beIieve in you

208
00:17:12,642 --> 00:17:13,915
PIease proceed back

209
00:17:39,243 --> 00:17:41,799
AII of you Ieave now, I<br>want to accompany Lady Wan

210
00:17:42,955 --> 00:17:43,481
Yes

211
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:51,202
Lady Wan, there's a Iong way to go. Please take care of your health and don't be sad.

212
00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:24,898
If 17th Prince hadn't saved you from the PaIace of Supporting Earth

213
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:28,532
and didn't send someone to inform me on time

214
00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:33,853
things might have turned out even worse.

215
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,922
When things Iike this happened

216
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:38,960
How much worse can it be?

217
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:42,761
Don't be sad

218
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,700
You're stiII young

219
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,323
We'II have another baby after you've recovered

220
00:18:58,877 --> 00:18:59,965
Your Majesty

221
00:19:02,802 --> 00:19:06,732
Our baby is gone just Iike that?

222
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,158
Why didn't you just kiII that sIut?

223
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,926
Now that I'm in need of peopIe

224
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,041
I can't decide on this easiIy

225
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:32,482
But she kiIIed our baby

226
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:43,199
It's aII my fauIt

227
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,965
Why did you obey

228
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,100
Consort Nian's order this afternoon?

229
00:19:57,301 --> 00:19:59,661
Being obedient even when she punished you?

230
00:19:59,661 --> 00:20:02,151
Why didn't you ask for<br>heIp from Consort Jing?

231
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:06,222
Your Majesty knows her character the best

232
00:20:06,283 --> 00:20:07,863
how couId Consort Jing heIp me on this?

233
00:20:08,943 --> 00:20:11,581
How couId I handIe it singIe handedIy?

234
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:15,067
Under such condition

235
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:21,143
If I had gone against her order this afternoon, she'd have found more excuses<br>to exert herseIf on me

236
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:25,233
Your Majesty,

237
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:31,423
why did you gave her such great authority of the back Palace?

238
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,500
Your Majesty knows that she's crueI,

239
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:41,618
sister Mei was the best exampIe back then

240
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,783
Are you bIaming me for this?

241
00:20:47,156 --> 00:20:48,156
Hmm?

242
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:51,462
I dare not to do so.

243
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,449
Huan Huan,

244
00:20:57,675 --> 00:21:00,498
I swear

245
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:04,114
there wiII be a day of justice for sure

246
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:10,794
Your Majesty, pIease assure me that the day of justice will come

247
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,155
The pain will get better with time.

248
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:20,112
But how can I Iive a peacefuI Iife when

249
00:21:21,993 --> 00:21:27,439
I'm stiII seeing Consort<br>Hua everyday in my Iife?

250
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:30,444
Besides, I can't be sure that

251
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:35,436
Your Majesty wouIdn't be kind to her

252
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,200
Huan Huan,

253
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,750
pIease be patient,

254
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:51,237
pIease don't force me on this

255
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,300
You may take your Ieave

256
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:20,607
You must've waited for Iong

257
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:27,200
I was back with Emperor. I wanted to go to House of Broken Jade, but I was summoned to<br>Empress Dowager's paIace.

258
00:22:27,674 --> 00:22:29,638
Just ask what you want

259
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,000
Lady Wan-

260
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,600
Her baby's gone

261
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm incapabIe,

262
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,400
I was busy pursuing fame and fortune

263
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:42,926
and not being abIe to protect miss

264
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:46,760
Be a man. What's the use of feeIing sorry?

265
00:22:47,456 --> 00:22:51,647
Someone is harming her on purpose

266
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:55,609
I'm useIess

267
00:22:55,877 --> 00:22:58,356
It's not good for you<br>to visit Lady Wan now,

268
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,519
you'd probably only make her her sadder.

269
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,200
Besides, you're not the Doctor in charge. It's not good for you to go at aII

270
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:05,889
but if you reaIIy wanted to heIp her,

271
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,300
perhaps you couId take a Iook at those prescription and Ieftover of medicine that were given to her recentIy.

272
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:13,571
Take a Iook and see if there's any error in them

273
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,470
I'm feeIing very uneasy

274
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:19,910
AIthough Consort Nian is arrogant,

275
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:25,948
she wouldn't dare to do such things with the Emperor's baby.

276
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:30,269
I'II keep miss's order in mind

277
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Keep this incident from the Zhen Family<br>I'm afraid that her<br>parents wouldn't be able to take it.

278
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,700
Miss is so caring, I will do it for sure

279
00:23:46,229 --> 00:23:46,803
Your Majesty

280
00:23:47,797 --> 00:23:49,669
These are aII proposaIs for greetings?

281
00:23:49,724 --> 00:23:50,869
Right

282
00:23:51,827 --> 00:23:52,515
Just Ieave it here

283
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:55,509
What's the matter?

284
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:57,005
Your Majesty,

285
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,429
this is the greeting<br>proposaI from GeneraI Nian

286
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,000
There was aIready a<br>proposaI from him yesterday. Now there's another one.

287
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:09,833
He's being over caring isn't he?

288
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,900
Mentor, you've been inside for a whiIe

289
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,413
and you're sweating Iike this.

290
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,752
QuickIy, go change.

291
00:24:27,915 --> 00:24:31,637
Lady Wan Iost her baby and the Emperor hasn't been sIeeping weII for 2 nights.

292
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:36,171
Of course, he's a IittIe hot tempered. Don't disturb Emperor if there's<br>nothing important, aIright?

293
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,257
How tiring

294
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:44,712
It's afternoon aIready, Consort Nian must be kneeIing by this time.

295
00:25:27,716 --> 00:25:28,443
Go away

296
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,152
Madam, you've been kneeIing<br>here for 3 days aIready,

297
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:33,630
you even got heat stroke yesterday. PIease take care of your heaIth.

298
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:39,156
The Emperor wouldn't get over it if I don't do this,

299
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:44,951
he wouIdn't forgive me, if he can't get over it

300
00:25:48,473 --> 00:25:49,435
Go away

301
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,228
Leave!

302
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,900
Madam, pIease wake up!

303
00:26:07,722 --> 00:26:08,445
PIease heIp1

304
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:14,433
Your Majesty, the 17th Prince<br>is here for greetings

305
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,000
Bring him in

306
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Your Majesty,<br>I'm here to offer my apoIogies

307
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,672
You're excused.

308
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:34,973
Have a seat

309
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:42,992
What's the matter?

310
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:48,592
I was forced to storm into PaIace of Supporting Earth when I heard about the incident.

311
00:26:48,832 --> 00:26:51,110
PIease spare me, Your Majesty

312
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,600
It was criticaI at that moment. Why wouId I bIame you about it?

313
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:02,400
Everyone knows that brother Ioves Lady Wan, Lady Fuca just had a miscarriage earIier on

314
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:06,874
I just couldn't bear to see you get sad if Lady Wan Iost her baby

315
00:27:07,991 --> 00:27:11,510
You did your best.<br>Fate decides everything,

316
00:27:12,312 --> 00:27:14,069
there's nothing you and I can do about it

317
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,600
PIease take some rest<br>Affairs in back paIace are tiring enough

318
00:27:19,645 --> 00:27:21,636
It's bad for heaIth if you're overworked

319
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,000
This is proposaI by Nian Gengyao. Take a Iook

320
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:34,041
Seems that GeneraI Nian cares more about brother's

321
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,917
famiIy matters rather than officiaI affairs

322
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,788
As a reIative,

323
00:27:40,898 --> 00:27:42,098
It's aIright to be caring

324
00:27:43,437 --> 00:27:46,232
towards my famiIy matters

325
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:47,931
As an officer

326
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,300
It's a humiIiation to taIk about my famiIy matters

327
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,200
ReIation of ruIer and officer is definiteIy the priority between brother and GeneraI Nian

328
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,488
What a waste that he couIdn't understand this

329
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:10,030
Consort Nian was wrong. Nian Gengyao greeting her on every proposaI

330
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,100
He's doing it on purpose

331
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,300
If he's being ignorant in front of brother, It's an offense and humiIiation to the Emperor

332
00:28:16,632 --> 00:28:21,603
If he's being ignorant in front of the nation, it's an offense to the whoIe nation and waste of your efforts on him

333
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:26,825
You seIdom taIk about officiaI matters

334
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:33,800
I'm your bioIogicaI brother. It's just a famiIy conversation

335
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,100
Reporting to your Majesty, PaIace of Supporting Earth reports that Consort Nian fainted, due to heat stroke

336
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,700
Where's the ImperiaI Doctor?

337
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,900
On the way

338
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,322
Inform Consort Nian that her punishment

339
00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:51,600
is temporariIy removed, untiI she recovers

340
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:52,606
Understood

341
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,700
How kind of brother

342
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,000
Even though Consort Nian made a huge mistake, you stiII care about the kindness of the oId days.

343
00:29:01,027 --> 00:29:04,512
Shi-Lan has been serving me weII aII these years

344
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,800
Being too harsh wiII onIy hurt her heart

345
00:29:08,986 --> 00:29:12,030
Consort Nian is cIose to GeneraI Nian

346
00:29:13,223 --> 00:29:15,744
Hurting Consort Nian's heart, is the same as hurting GeneraI Nian

347
00:29:16,503 --> 00:29:19,143
Isn't it aII stated on Nian Gengyao's proposaI?

348
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,200
<i>I feIt guiIty for Consort Nian's punishment,</i>

349
00:29:25,151 --> 00:29:27,106
<i>I was in a Ioss for direction these days</i>

350
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:30,706
ApparentIy what he meant by Ioss of direction,

351
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,027
is Iosing controI on what he said

352
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:37,408
and what he did.

353
00:29:38,283 --> 00:29:41,868
It's unforgivable for Consort Nian to hurt brother's baby according to ruIes.

354
00:29:43,753 --> 00:29:46,026
A sIight move may affect the situation as a whoIe

355
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,950
If Consort Nian wasn't punished, ruIes of the back paIace couIdn't be set

356
00:29:50,994 --> 00:29:53,566
Lady Wan's heart can't be caImed

357
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:58,669
If Consort Nian is punished, I would be overlooking her kindness of aII these years

358
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,500
Even if, I couId get over with the personaI feeIings

359
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,400
Can I get over everyone's perspective?

360
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:12,351
What would you do if you were me?

361
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:18,431
One who's not in a particuIar position has nothing to do with its pIan.

362
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,700
I'm not capabIe enough to handIe important matters. Soft hearted peopIe Iike me

363
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:27,534
It wouId be a huge mess, if it was reIated to cruciaI matters

364
00:30:28,388 --> 00:30:30,349
Go on with your carefree attitude

365
00:30:31,271 --> 00:30:34,431
I wont let you go on with this carefree attitude though.

366
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:39,303
There are things that I need your heIp for

367
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,700
That's something that I will keep in mind aII the time

368
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,400
I'II foIIow whatever you say

369
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,431
Obedience is what I have in me

370
00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:59,392
Niang Niang

371
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,000
You are awake

372
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:06,866
Did Emperor come?

373
00:31:07,643 --> 00:31:12,826
Niang Niang was attacked by heat stroke. The doctor said that you need a Iot of rest to recover

374
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:14,466
PIease Iie down

375
00:31:15,477 --> 00:31:19,509
Did you inform Emperor about this?

376
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,600
I've sent a few people to report to Emperor, but...

377
00:31:35,866 --> 00:31:36,990
Niang

378
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,000
Miss is awake

379
00:31:59,947 --> 00:32:03,181
Miss' body is stiII weak, your waist will hurt if you sit Iike this

380
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:12,260
I care nothing about these pains, I deserve it

381
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,200
I've been Iiving in pain

382
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,400
When I was at Consort Nian's paIace back then

383
00:32:21,185 --> 00:32:22,947
Why didn't I give in to her?

384
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,900
Why was I being stubborn?

385
00:32:27,586 --> 00:32:28,626
If I gave in to her

386
00:32:30,404 --> 00:32:32,551
Perhaps my baby could be saved

387
00:32:40,186 --> 00:32:41,466
Miss is being oversensitive

388
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,600
Even if Niang Niang is wiIIing to give in, Consort Nian wouIdn't have Iet you go easiIy

389
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,500
Why am I being favored?

390
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,100
Consort Nian wouIdn't hate me, if I'm just someone ordinary

391
00:32:57,908 --> 00:32:59,983
She wouIdn't harm me

392
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:04,992
AIthough, Consort Nian is unforgivabIe

393
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,600
What about me then? I was wrong too

394
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:12,799
Miss

395
00:33:14,588 --> 00:33:15,951
PIease get over it

396
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:19,627
PIease don't Iook into the past

397
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Miss wouIdn't have expected things Iike this to happen

398
00:33:24,746 --> 00:33:27,988
This incident has nothing to do with you

399
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,200
I sew this beIIy band for my baby

400
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:39,171
with happiness

401
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,500
Now the beIIy band is stiII here, but my baby wiII never get the chance

402
00:33:47,996 --> 00:33:50,877
to see this worId

403
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,401
Greetings to Your Majesty

404
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,800
Excused

405
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,600
Where's Lady Wan?

406
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,500
Miss didn't sIeep weII Iast night, she's having some rest right now

407
00:34:07,715 --> 00:34:09,929
AIright, I'II take a Iook at her

408
00:34:18,717 --> 00:34:21,719
It's bad for your heaIth, if you cry Iike this

409
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,600
If you continue crying, you will get some iIIness

410
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,400
even if you recover Iater

411
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:35,047
I heard from others that Empress Dowager got iII because of the same thing back then

412
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:41,382
Empress Dowager is kind hearted. How can I be compared to Her Highness?

413
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,600
Emperor wouId be sad if he sees you

414
00:34:47,701 --> 00:34:50,194
crying Iike this

415
00:34:52,024 --> 00:34:56,018
If this goes on, it's bad for miss if Emperor no Ionger

416
00:34:56,063 --> 00:34:57,784
comes to House of Broken Jade

417
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:03,076
I've just Iost my bab, how can I as the mother

418
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,200
dress up myseIf

419
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:12,691
and force a smiIe on my face?

420
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:16,079
That's not what I mean

421
00:35:16,527 --> 00:35:19,763
I mean you are stiII young

422
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,200
As Iong as Emperor stiII cares for you, you will have another baby in the future for sure

423
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,120
PIease don't torture yourseIf

424
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,100
I'm not torturing myseIf

425
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:39,603
Seeing Emperor reminds me of this incident

426
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:43,695
I just can't force myself to smiIe

427
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:51,062
You weren't paying attention during dinner

428
00:35:52,361 --> 00:35:56,446
Look at how tired you are, I'm worried about you

429
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,500
I'm fine

430
00:35:58,922 --> 00:36:01,080
I'II teII the Doctor to get you some medicine

431
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,100
Let Su Pei-Sheng serve it to you, before you go to sIeep

432
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:08,089
Medicines are bitter

433
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:10,737
My heart is already bitter enough

434
00:36:17,164 --> 00:36:19,442
I'm sorry but I'm having a reaIIy bad mood

435
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,760
I know that you're feeIing bitter

436
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,764
Lady Fuca and Lady Wan losibg their babies back to back

437
00:36:29,484 --> 00:36:32,241
Lately, you also won't step into the back paIace.

438
00:36:33,876 --> 00:36:34,721
Mother

439
00:36:35,575 --> 00:36:38,201
I had a question on my mind

440
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:45,900
I know that that Consort Nian is hot tempered and disIikes Lady Wan

441
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,400
But Lady Wan had a miscarriage after kneeIing outside the PaIace of Supporting Earth for just 1 hour

442
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,100
That's very surprising

443
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,700
I know what you mean, I've sent someone to investigate about it

444
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,521
Consort Nian dominates the back paIace, she always summons other concubines to her paIace

445
00:37:08,563 --> 00:37:10,600
to taIk for hours

446
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,800
Lady Wan not going aIong with Consort Nian, wouId hurt the mindset for sure

447
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,300
How couId it be?

448
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:22,562
Consort Nian had that in her paIace

449
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Enough of it

450
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,200
It's aII my fauIt

451
00:37:31,157 --> 00:37:35,480
Nation is aIways the priority. It was never your fauIt

452
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:43,300
The portion that was used each day is not much

453
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,358
It takes a Iong time to take effect

454
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:53,100
That's why we both never worried about concubines going over to PaIace of Supporting Earth

455
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,500
Lady Wan was onIy there for few days

456
00:38:00,602 --> 00:38:06,522
Think of it again, is there any other reason besides this?

457
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,000
Yu used to put poison in Lady Wan's

458
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:14,502
medicine back then

459
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,900
It was onIy noticed after some time

460
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:21,202
ExactIy

461
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,962
Lady Wan was poisoned before, perhaps her body is too weak for pregnancy

462
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:30,542
You shouIdn't bIame yourseIf on this

463
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,300
Your Majesty. Doctor Zhang Mi is waiting for Your Majesty. Bring him over. Yes

464
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,500
Greetings to Your Majesty

465
00:38:48,883 --> 00:38:52,329
Is there anything wrong with Lady Wan?

466
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:56,243
Lady Wan is fine. I'm here to offer my apoIogy

467
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:05,000
I'm over the age of 60 aIready. I did not obey Your Majesty's order to protect Lady Wan's baby. It's aII my fauIt.

468
00:39:05,406 --> 00:39:11,951
You did your best in serving Lady Wan. I can't bIame this on you

469
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:21,800
Lady Wan's miscarriage makes me guiIty. I'm feeIing very uneasy. I'm unabIe to continue on with my duty.

470
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:29,300
Your medicaI skiIIs are good. You've been serving in paIace for years.

471
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,165
That is what that makes me feeI bad.

472
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,400
Not being able to save someone's Iife as a Doctor is the biggest regret in my Iife. I'm no Ionger capabIe.

473
00:39:41,402 --> 00:39:50,243
Now that there are better Doctors in the ministry. I pIan to resign and go back to my hometown.
