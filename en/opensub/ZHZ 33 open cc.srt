1
00:00:03,543 --> 00:00:05,732
Lady, you didn't eat at aII...

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,600
why don't you eat something?

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,900
Niang niang, Duke Dun's wife wishes to see you.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,000
I only meet her once

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,300
I've only met her once.

6
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,834
Why she want to see

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,600
Why would she come to visit me?

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,100
A sick and discarded and unloved consort like me.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Ask her to go. <br>I will.

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,900
Why have you come, Fujin? (note: Fujin = the title of the wife of the son or brother of an emperor)

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,100
I came into the palace today to pay my respects to the Dowager Empress.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,000
then I went to visit the Empress.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,400
Please take a seat.

14
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,619
<br>

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,900
I heard that you weren't feeling well, so I stopped by to visit.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Thank you Fujin.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,300
I shouldn't be seeing anyone while sick.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,900
I didn't expect you to come.

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,100
I'm sorry for my appearance.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,300
Though it's only been a few months since I last saw you<br>Niang Niang has become like this...

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,800
Thank you for your kindness and thoughts.

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,000
I am visiting today to bring a box of ginseng for Niang Niang.

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,300
I hope that you will accept it to nourish your body.

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,500
Thank you for your kind thoughts.

25
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:29,400
<br>

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,500
I know that the Duke my husband often has a bad temper.

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,400
If he's somehow offended Niangniang,

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,900
and Niangniang is unwilling to associate with us,

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,100
you may just throw out my gift. I won't be offended.

30
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,900
How can it be so?<br>You must not worry about that.

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,300
I came without being called by the Emperor. I don't dare to stay long.

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,100
I'll come another day to see Niangniang.

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,600
I hope that the Consort recovers soon.

34
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,600
Jin-Xi, see the Fujin out.

35
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,500
I will.

36
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,900
Lady...

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,000
Lady, do you want<br>to throw away the Ginseng?

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,600
Though her husband doesn't get along with us,

39
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,200
but this ginseng is her gift.

40
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,300
Send it to the ImperiaI Doctor Wen<br>see if the ImperiaI Doctors have use for it.

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,200
We will.

42
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,400
I've been sick for so long,

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,800
Who knew that she would be the one who is still willing to come see me?

44
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,200
The changes in people's attitudes from warm to cold has always been this way.

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,000
thanks goddess, Consort<br>Hui and Consort Jing

46
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,974
still always think of Xiaozhu, right?

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,200
Let the servants do things like this sort of massaging.

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,900
This humble servant wants to do things like this.

49
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,600
If I can make Your Majesty more comfortable,

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,100
It makes me happy.

51
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,300
"If there's was no heIpfuI and<br>cIever person in the country"

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,400
"if there's were no intruders and<br>enemies among the country (people)"

53
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,100
this country wiII be destroyed quickly.

54
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,300
<br>you can Iearn to survive suffering,<br> whiIe being comfortable can cause your death.

55
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,200
Meng Fuzi's words are very wise.

56
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,500
A comfortabIe Iife can make<br>peopIe Iose their minds.

57
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,200
onIy hard work and<br> and seIf-motivation can lead to success

58
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,400
think of dangerous during safety Iife,<br> be prepared and predict the outcomes before facing the difficuIties.

59
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,200
All the greatest emperors in history have been so.

60
00:03:33,217 --> 00:03:35,284
Don't you agree?

61
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,300
Of course.

62
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,300
Your Majesty spoke a lot

63
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:42,100
Take some water

64
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,700
perhaps have some water?

65
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,692
If the Consort Wan is here

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,600
If Consort Wan was here<br>she could be able to talk with me about this.

67
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,200
Jie jie is educated and talented.

68
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,700
Speaking about history is her expertise.

69
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,100
I heard she became sick at the start of autumn.

70
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,000
Did you pay her a visit?<br>How is she?

71
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,800
The sickness comes from the heart.

72
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:11,078
if Your Majesty pays her a visit, <br>I think she wiII recover quickly.

73
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:13,540
It's not that I don't want to go visit her.

74
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,000
it's just that I am afraid that closeness <br>will make affection more hesitant.

75
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:22,395
How is her wound?<br> Has it gotten better?

76
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:25,862
It's much better and there is no scar.

77
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:30,162
That's good. There's nothing more <br>important for a woman than her appearance.

78
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:33,760
<br>Your masjesty

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,300
I have a request to ask of you.

80
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,900
What is it? Ask standing up.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,400
I will.

82
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:42,758
<br>

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,200
After Jie Jie lost her child, <br>she was so upset that she became sick.

84
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,800
If Your Majesty does not go to see her,

85
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,601
Why don't you allow her family to see her?

86
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,500
So that she can talk about her pain <br>with someone, and find release.

87
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,200
Since she lost a child, it would be good <br>for her to be comforted by her family.

88
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:02,580
<br>

89
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,500
But right now her heart is full of hatred<br>of me and of Consort Nian.

90
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,900
If she speaks about it with her family<br>she will only become more upset<br>and be unable to let it go.

91
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,288
And it will not be good for her illness.

92
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,100
Your Majesty thinks thoroughly,<br>this humble servant cannot match you.

93
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:19,784
<i></i>

94
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,400
You and her are close like sisters.<br>I'm sure you are thinking only <br>of her welfare, and that's good.

95
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,600
Earlier Your Majesty said,

96
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,500
When people make mistakes, they <b> should be able to correct their mistakes,</b>

97
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,300
that's something I understand.

98
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,800
Though I often am lacking in many things before Your Majesty,<br>I have corrected my mistakes.

99
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,500
I only hope that Your Majesty will be moved by my efforts.

100
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,700
You know the meaning of those words,

101
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,300
but a clever woman Iike Imperial Concubine Wan can't?

102
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:52,778
It's all right if Jie Jie cannot understand it,<br>as long as she remembers one thing:

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,500
That Your Majesty has the Mandate of Heaven,<br>and Your Majesty is always right.

104
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:05,565
<i></i>

105
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:08,644
Don't bother going back to your palace tonight.<br>Stay here and keep me company.

106
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,600
Did Your Majesty forget? You have plans with the 17th Prince

107
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,300
to admire the calligraphy of Dong Qi-Chang. <br> The 17th prince is already here.

108
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,200
He doesn't have anything better to do anyway.

109
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,700
Let him stay a few days at<br> the House of Concentrating GIow.

110
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,300
I'll meet with him another day.

111
00:06:25,443 --> 00:06:26,100
<i><br></i>

112
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,200
Your cIothes was made of siIk brocade.

113
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,700
Of course. Did Your Majesty forget?

114
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,100
You gave me some silk brocade last time,

115
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,500
so I asked the ImperiaI<br>HousehoId to make me a set of new cIothes.

116
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,100
SiIk brocade, you Iook good in it

117
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,700
Whatever stock we have in Imperial Affairs, they're all yours.

118
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

119
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:52,901
<br>

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,800
Though Lady has been ill for some days now, <br>no one has come to visit her.

121
00:06:58,953 --> 00:06:59,858
ahh..

122
00:06:59,994 --> 00:07:02,837
"You only find out people's true <br>character after a long period of time."

123
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,200
Now we see how true that saying is.<br>Some people were only close to us before,

124
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,700
just wish to take advantage of Lady's favor from His Majesty.

125
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:11,553
<br>

126
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,900
His Majesty seIdom comes to the palace now,

127
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,000
And when he is here

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,641
he always goes to see the Empress <br>At the Hall of Complete Happiness.

129
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,700
Though the words "take advantage of" are ugly,

130
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,900
if you have nothing for people to take advantage of, <br>that's when you're really in trouble.

131
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:27,778
Though that's a horrible thought,<br>I think you're right.

132
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,200
in the paIace<br>onIy a vaIueabIe person can survive

133
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,800
So we've got to be people who have something that others want,

134
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,900
It's only when we allow others to take advantage of us, <br>that we can take advantage of them.

135
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,500
It's useless to just say that.<br>We have to think of a plan.

136
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,600
These days, Precious An gets to meet His Majesty nowadays often.

137
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,500
but we can't possibly rely on her to help.

138
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,100
Eunuch Su is a servant, he can't heIp

139
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,400
We have to find someone whose words have weight,

140
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,900
but who we can see to ask to talk some sense into Lady

141
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,200
Oh! I heard 17th Prince is in the paIace.

142
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,600
What's the use of that? He's not someone we can reach.

143
00:08:08,778 --> 00:08:19,600
<br>

144
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,700
Jie Jie, you've been here for more than half the day.

145
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,000
Why do you persist in staring at me like that?

146
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:31,600
I was just thinking, "What would it look like <br>if she really gave up on the Emperor?"

147
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,200
Do you really think I haven't already given up?

148
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,100
What do you think?

149
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,600
If you really do not care for him still, <br>why would you still be stuck in illness?

150
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,400
Rather than be like this, even though<br> His Majesty has not come to see you,

151
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,100
you can always go and find him and stop <br>making your place as lonely as the Cold Palace.

152
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,500
if His Majesty wanted to come, he would come.

153
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,500
if not, what's the point of forcing him?

154
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,100
You are different from me.<br>I was never close to His Majesty.

155
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,900
Since he put me under house arrest <br>and never looked into the matter again,

156
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
I know that he is cold and unreliable.

157
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Though now he acts as though I do not exist,<br>I don't really mind at all.

158
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
But it's different for you.

159
00:09:16,814 --> 00:09:21,500
Why, because I have more feelings for him than you do?

160
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,500
if you reaIIy didn't care for him, <br>you would be as I am now.

161
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,900
You would not feel pain from his words.

162
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:37,000
In the end... you know that he does care about you.

163
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:43,358
Anyway, since Ling-Rong was so close to us before,

164
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,500
even though she is two-faced, do you really think

165
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,700
that I should vie for attention and pit myself against her?

166
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,900
Besides, His Majesty really loves her more than he loves me.

167
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,300
When you were in favor, you helped her gain favor.

168
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,300
But now that she has favor, has she ever helped you?

169
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,700
If she really meant to help you, then there would be no talk of vying for attention.

170
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,000
But if she won't help you, do you plan to be like this forever?

171
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,300
Besides, His Majesty merely likes whoever he likes at the moment,

172
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,700
and his favor changes all the time.

173
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:19,596
Isn't the whole point of vying for favor<br>to just be loved a little more than another?

174
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,300
if you reaIIy give up on His Majesty,

175
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,800
you wouldn't be wasting your time being heartbroken here.

176
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,600
Jie Jie, I'm really stupid, aren't I?

177
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,000
I really wanted there to be a little bit of genuine and pure feelings

178
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:38,535
in a palace such as this.

179
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,800
I wished for the one thing I should never wish for.

180
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,800
Huan-Er

181
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:48,119
There are too many heartbroken people here already.

182
00:10:48,176 --> 00:10:50,979
Don't add yourself to those ranks.

183
00:10:52,476 --> 00:10:54,977
I understand.

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,400
Well, I must go pay my respects to the Dowager Empress.

185
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

186
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,300
Do you often go and visit the Dowager Empress?

187
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,600
Since my health recovered, my feelings for His Majesty<br>have changed greatly from what they were before.

188
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,600
Since Ling Rong is the favorite now, <br>we see very little of His Majesty.

189
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,600
I must find someone to rely on too.

190
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,800
The Dowager Empress must Iike sister very much.

191
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,900
She has been quite ill.

192
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,500
Since I have nothing better to do, I ought to keep her company.

193
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,352
I'll be going now.

194
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,600
Thank you for your hard work, Aunt.<br>Why don't you let me feed this to her/.

195
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,600
Whenever you're here, they get plenty of free time since

196
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
you do all the work for them.

197
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,100
Since I rarely get to come and visit you, please let me show my filial heart by serving you.

198
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,200
You? Rarely here? You are here every day!

199
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:55,185
If the Dowager Empress thinks I'm too stupid to be of use,<br>I'll not dare to come anymore.

200
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,300
You have a warm and calm personality and you are thoughtful and careful.

201
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,100
I like it when you are here.

202
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,300
I'm happy that the Dowager Empress does not dislike me.

203
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,600
Here--careful, it's hot.

204
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,700
It's because I like you that I feel the need to remind you,

205
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Since you have the time, try to spend more time with the Emperor.

206
00:12:21,081 --> 00:12:25,511
Lady FuCa and Lady Wan both miscarried.

207
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,100
The Emperor is upset, and now especially needs someone at his side.

208
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:32,701
I have been thinking that only one who did the knot can undo it.

209
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,700
His Majesty is upset because Imperial Concubine Wan has lost her child.

210
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,400
if Imperial Concubine Wan can spend time with His Majesty,<br>it would be the best.

211
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,200
If two people are frustrated with each other,

212
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,900
to force them to be together would make things even more awkward.

213
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,000
This can only be solved if one of them is able to get over it,

214
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,100
and make the first step towards reconciliation.

215
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,100
I understand.

216
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,805
Lady, the moon is quite lovely tonight.

217
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,700
Why don't we bring the Chang Xiang Si so you may play a song?

218
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:06,670
(Chang Xiang Si: "long love", the name of her guzheng)

219
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,156
It's true that there's something very poetic about playing a song to the mon.

220
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,900
But Chang Xiang Si will only hurt my heart, so I might as well not play it.

221
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,200
In the past, Lady's favorite was Li Bai's Chang Xiang Si.<br>(note: the poem from which the name of the guzheng comes)

222
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:25,075
At this moment, even if I wanted to, I don't dare to play it by myself.

223
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:36,098
Though Lady is unwilling to play that song, who is that out there<br>playing Chang Xiang Si?

224
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:43,844
This is the second half of the poem.

225
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,100
The long feelings in Chang'an,

226
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,100
The lady, lovely like a flower, is separated clouds away.

227
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,800
Above is the clear and blue sky, and below is the green sea foam of the ocean.

228
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,100
Sending the soul that distance brings pain.

229
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,200
Even in dreams the soul cannot make it to the mountain.

230
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,700
Huan-Bi, Iisten, the fIute is such a lovely sound.

231
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:15,106
What is Lady and Huan-Bi saying? I don't hear any flute.

232
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,500
You didn't hear that?

233
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
No, I don't.

234
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Though the sound is soft, it is lovely.

235
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,800
Isn't it amazing that there's another person in the palace<br>who likes Chang Xiang Si the way that Lady does?

236
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:31,007
Chang Xiang Si is a song that is too sad.

237
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
But when this person plays,

238
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,500
There is a stronger feeling of longing, but less sadness.

239
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,200
It makes me feel as though the feeling of longing is also a beautiful thing.

240
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,300
I wonder which Lady in the palace can play the flute so beautifully?

241
00:14:48,382 --> 00:14:51,500
You've been moved too by the flute, haven't you?

242
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,600
Why don't we take a walk, Lady?

243
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,300
The people of ancient times tread snow to find plum blossoms, following the scent of plum.

244
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,400
and now we are searching for a person, by the sound of their flute.

245
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,900
But with such a soft sound, I wonder if we'll find them at all?

246
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,400
I also wonder what the flute player looks like, <br>but things like this are all up to fate.

247
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,300
It would be best if we could find them, but if we can't, that would be all right too.

248
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,400
You've gotten much thinner.

249
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,600
During this season, the wind blows from the west

250
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,500
So of course it is easy to become thinner.

251
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:17,944
I am very grateful for the help you gave me the other day.

252
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,400
Imperial Concubine Wan, please do not say such things<br>to me as if we were strangers.

253
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,500
It's regretful that I was unable to save your child also.

254
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:37,470
Everyone thinks that the 17th prince broke into Yi Kun Palace and saved me because

255
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,303
I was a favorite with His Majesty.

256
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,900
And that to help me was just to do something for His Majesty.

257
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:51,000
But in any case, this kind of lending hand and justice, only seems to come from you.

258
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,700
Even though I have fallen far these days,

259
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:56,470
but I'm not someone who forgets what they owe.

260
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,000
In the future, if there's any help I can give to you, <br>I will of course do my best to help.

261
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,600
I wanted Imperial Concubine Wan to be safe because--

262
00:17:06,312 --> 00:17:09,601
I see you as an important friend.

263
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,200
I know that the 17th prince is only thinking of my wellbeing.

264
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:20,351
But if my lord associates with my close servant too often,

265
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,900
it would not be good for the reputation of my lord.

266
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Thank you for your advice.

267
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,500
why is Lord here tonight?

268
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,300
His Majesty asked me to stay the night.

269
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:36,831
Just now I went and greet His Majesty,

270
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,400
and saw singer An Guiren<br>who seems like someone I've seen before.

271
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,700
She used to be An Changzai.

272
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Is that so?

273
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:48,390
An Guiren's voice has improved greatly.

274
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,300
but her voice is lacking her own personality.

275
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,400
As Iong as His Majesty Iikes it, that's what matters, right?

276
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,800
Pure jade or goId are beauty made by nature.

277
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
but they must not lose their own qualities.

278
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:11,300
"The more you take, the more you lose,<br>even if you are stubborn, don't lose yourself."

279
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,200
The Chang Xiang Si I played just now, I hope

280
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:17,633
it will take away a little of your sadness, Wan Ping.

281
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,300
It's just a song.

282
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,500
Songs reflect what is in the hearts of people.<br>That's true, for you and for me too.

283
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Since His Majesty asked my lord to stay, <br>there must be things you have to do tomorrow.

284
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,600
I won't bother you any longer.

285
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,800
When did you start associating with the 17th prince?

286
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
It's not your mistress who's speaking to you now,<br>but your older sister.

287
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,500
You can answer or not.

288
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,800
I didn't mean to lie to Jie Jie.

289
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:16,448
Did it begin on my birthday?

290
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:20,558
That was why you never let me <br>near the lake that day, wasn't it?

291
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:23,481
He's the one who told you to do that, isn't he?

292
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,200
About what happened in the PaIace of Supporting Earth...

293
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,300
Are you the one who asked him for help?

294
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,700
That day Jing Xi Gugu was in the palace with you <br> and could not get away to find help.

295
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,000
The Empress Dowager was ill, and in the palace<br>there was no one who could help Jie Jie.

296
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,600
So I took a chance and asked the Duke.

297
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,400
How many times have you met since then?

298
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:49,400
just twice:once was during your miscarriage<br>and another time is today.

299
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,500
Lord never spoke about other things.

300
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,200
He just asked me to take good care of you.

301
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,100
Why is Jie Jie suddenly asking me about it today?

302
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,400
Did the Duke tell you about it?

303
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,800
Today you only did the regular greeting bow.

304
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,800
If you weren't meeting privately day to day, <br>you would be doing the more formal greeting.

305
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,500
I'm sorry--I wasn't careful enough.

306
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,900
Since I'm in a strange position right now,

307
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,200
If you meet with him too often, it's not good for us or for him.

308
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,300
Don't meet with him again in private.

309
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,600
Hello, Hui-Chun.

310
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,100
Congratulations, Mistress, for having had <br>the favor of His Majesty last night.

311
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:42,100
I'm here to follow Empress's instructions.

312
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,400
As usual, please drink this.

313
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,400
These days, all the sewing work must be done by you two yourselves.

314
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,400
I've caused you two to be dragged down with me.

315
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:24,500
Not at all. To get close to those who are high up<br>and step on those below is the usual thing here.

316
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,800
The Internal Affairs people are busy making silk <br>blockade clothes for An Guiren these days.

317
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,200
Actually, I your humble servant enjoy making my own clothing.

318
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,600
There's true warmth and fit when I wear it.

319
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,800
In the end Ling-Rong is the one with good fortune now. <br>She's become the favorite these days.

320
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,200
Hello, Jiejie.

321
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,000
Why are you all making your own winter clothes?

322
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,200
The Internal Affairs people are too busy <br>to bother with us presently.

323
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,000
Since it's getting much colder now, we must make the clothing ourselves.

324
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,800
Come with me somewhere.

325
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,600
Let me finish organizing these silk threads first.

326
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,800
Come.

327
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,400
Where are we going?

328
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,597
Let's go.

329
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,800
Jiejie, that's the Cold Palace ahead.

330
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:18,417
Walk quickly.

331
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,500
just guess! Guess when His Majesty will finally come?

332
00:22:30,572 --> 00:22:33,795
You cheat! I don't want to play with you

333
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,800
One day His Majesty wiII faII in love with me

334
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,700
His Majesty? Does he even remember you?

335
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,200
Give me that!

336
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,300
I won't!

337
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:56,587
Take a guess at who she is.

338
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,300
Are you OK?

339
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,200
Did Jiejie want me to come here

340
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,000
So I can see Li Ping?

341
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,100
Did you see the woman<br>next to Li Ping?

342
00:23:38,622 --> 00:23:42,513
She is someone who used to be a Guiren.

343
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,800
Who is she?

344
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:46,315
It's not important who she is.

345
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,100
What's important is that she too was once pregnant but fell and miscarried.

346
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,000
Because she was too sad, she gave up on His Majesty.

347
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,600
And then, she complained and accused Hua Fei of murdering her child.

348
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,700
That's why she's been sent here to the Cold Palace.

349
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,900
Are you afraid I'll follow in her footsteps?

350
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:09,868
Whether she really did accuse and insult Hua Fei, no one knows.

351
00:24:09,918 --> 00:24:12,870
What matters is that His Majesty believed that she did.

352
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,500
The saying goes, "The more you see someone the more you are fond of them."

353
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,049
She wallowed in her own pain and refused to care for His Majesty.

354
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,200
So she never even had the chance to see him and defend herself.

355
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,200
But if she was set up, all she can do is be set up.

356
00:24:28,293 --> 00:24:30,665
This is an example of what can happen to you.

357
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,900
if you keep going Iike this,

358
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,600
what they look like now is going to be what happens to you.

359
00:24:44,226 --> 00:24:47,649
His Majesty gave you the best quality silk brocade.

360
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:53,000
When you wear it you will look moving and beautiful, <br>gaining you even more favor from His Majesty.

361
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,800
I am but a lowly person, and do not deserve such good things.

362
00:24:56,957 --> 00:25:00,195
All the treasure of this world should belong to you the Empress.

363
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,200
That is why I have brought these to offer them all to you.

364
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,400
When you are a favorite with His Majesty, even <br>gold threaded clothing will be easy to get.

365
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:17,600
These brocades are nothing compared to the favor of His Majesty.

366
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,200
I am only where I am today with the help of you the Empress.

367
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,700
I shall never forget it.

368
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,329
You may stand.

369
00:25:28,496 --> 00:25:30,860
You have a good heart.

370
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:37,600
The silk brocade His Majesty has given you now is several times<br>what he gave to Wan Ping in the days she had favor.

371
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,500
How does it feel to monopolize his favor?

372
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,400
In my heart I understand that without <br>your guidance, I wouldn't have any of this.

373
00:25:45,697 --> 00:25:49,414
I know your feeling of gratitude.

374
00:25:49,462 --> 00:25:54,466
You wanted to replace Wan Ping, and<br>I have made that dream come true.

375
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,300
Nian Fei is too arrogant, whiIe Wan Ping is too cIever.<br>I do not like either of them.

376
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,100
Since you are a good child, I helped myself by helping you.

377
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,400
But there is one thing you must remember no matter what---

378
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,600
After I've served His Majesty intimately, I have followed your instructions<br>and drank the medication you gave me.

379
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,200
It's good that you are an obedient child.

380
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,000
It is not that I won't allow you to have a child,

381
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,800
but that you've only gained favor recently.

382
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:30,000
if you are pregnant others wiII get the advantage <br>and have time to steal the favor from you.

383
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,600
You are still young, and there are many days to come yet.

384
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,900
Thank you for your guidance.

385
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,100
Hurry!

386
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,900
Oh, it's Wan Ping.

387
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:54,488
Why aren't you more careful while you walk?

388
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,500
Have you forgotten about the rules of the palace just<br>because you haven't seen His Majesty in a while?

389
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm sorry for running into you, Qi Fei Niangniang.

390
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,600
Oh, I wondered who you were.

391
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,000
Why, if it isn't the previous favorite of His Majesty, Wan Ping!

392
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
No wonder! Favorite consorts always walk all over everybody.

393
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,300
Please forgive me, Qi Fei Niangniang.

394
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,900
Oi, you say "Niangniang" so intimately!

395
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,600
Let's just go. Just looking at her makes me feel unfortunate.

396
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,100
Niangniang, of course she is unfortunate.

397
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
She caused you to not be able to be with your son.

398
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,800
I really didn't mean to run into you, Qi Fei Niangniang.<br>Please forgive me.

399
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,600
Wan Ping Niangniang has always been known as the one who <br>is strict about rules and about treating your betters well!

400
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:48,000
And now, you don't even do the proper greeting <br>when you run into Qi Fei!

401
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,000
Please forgive me, Qi Fei Niangniang.

402
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:59,800
Fine. As long as you don't appear before me I'll consider myself lucky.

403
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,600
Get out of here, as far as you can.

404
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,500
Niangniang, she's the one who wronged you first.<br>Don't let her go just like this!

405
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,400
Forget it. I don't have the time to waste sitting here arguing with her.

406
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:12,811
Just let her go.

407
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,300
You've forgotten, Niangniang. These days, <br>Nian Fei is no longer the favorite.

408
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,100
Jing Fei is completely useless and Duan Fei is always ill.

409
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:24,108
Among the Fei rank, you are the most important now!

410
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,600
If you don't show people what you're made of now,

411
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,700
Who will even remember you in the future?

412
00:28:30,978 --> 00:28:34,490
Just think about it, Niangniang. <br>If she weren't such a slut,

413
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:36,285
Why would His Majesty lose interest in us?

414
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,000
Why would my child be dead when hers comes?

415
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,000
And the 3rd prince can't even come see you, his birth mother!

416
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,351
I didn't forget!

417
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,500
It's you. It was all you!

418
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,800
According to Fucha Guiren I caused your child to die.

419
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,800
but what of my child? Who killed it?

420
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,000
When I lost my child, yours suddenly appeared!

421
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:04,100
My saddest and most painful days were the days<br>you were just flying to the sky with glory!

422
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,000
If it weren't you who killed my child, who did?!

423
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,200
That your child died is obviously karma.

424
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,500
If you are convinced of that,

425
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,300
then I have nothing further to say.

426
00:29:17,351 --> 00:29:18,596
YOU have nothing to say?

427
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,500
If you hadn't ratted Niangniang out to the Empress, <br>she would be able to see her son now!

428
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
It's all because of you, the bitch.

429
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,400
There is a cause to every effect.

430
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:34,500
Why Qi Fei Niangniang was punished, she knows very well herself.

431
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,100
I didn't want to keep at her about it, <br>and so never informed His Majesty.

432
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,000
If it weren't for that, I think her punishment

433
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:47,697
would not stop at not being able to see the 3rd prince occasionally!

434
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,800
Good. Very good.

435
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,800
You even dare to talk back to me now?

436
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,000
Cui-Guo, sIap her until her mouth rots!

437
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,212
Please forgive me, Qi Fei Niangniang.

438
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:16,700
Don't worry, Cui-Guo. Hit her as hard as you can.<br>Even His Majesty won't see her now.

439
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,800
It's just Qi Fei Niangniang's duty to punish those who do not behave.

440
00:30:21,024 --> 00:30:24,595
Those who dare to falsely accuse their betters,<br>already deserved to be slapped long ago!

441
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:33,800
Cui-Guo, if you don't sIap her,<br>I'II send you to Sheng Xing Si for punishment.

442
00:30:34,172 --> 00:30:35,860
Do it!

443
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,454
Do it!

444
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,100
You've finally wised up to the fact that

445
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:05,471
there's no use in begging, so you might as well be quiet.

446
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,700
It looks like Nian Fei really gave you a good lesson!

447
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,700
You can stop now.

448
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:21,000
You have plenty of time to sit here and be slapped,<br>But I have no time to waste on you.

449
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,900
You just kneel here at this door and think about what you've done.

450
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Cui-Guo, stand here and watch her.<br>Don't let her get up before two hours are up.

451
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:41,300
Since Wan Ping is no longer pregnant, it won't hurt her to kneel.

452
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,800
Only when her body feels pain, will she know our pain.

453
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,900
Qi Fei Niangniang, must you persecute me this way?

454
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,700
Don't you love to talk behind my back to the Empress?

455
00:32:00,871 --> 00:32:04,808
It's been so long now and you have no proof.

456
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,600
Even if I put the poIIen of oIeander in your food, so what?

457
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:13,462
All the evidence is gone now.

458
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:22,807
If you dare bring it up again, I will punish you well<br>for your sin of slandering!

459
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,700
Don't be angry, Wan Ping Niangniang.

460
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,200
Please bear this small amount of humiliation with a smile.

461
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,800
Do you honestly think you are the same Wan Ping as before?

462
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:49,700
Let's go. We've still got to go to Internal<br>Affairs to pick out some things!

463
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:58,700
Wan Ping Niangniang, why don't you stand up?<br>I won't tell anyone.

464
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:09,000
Cui-Guo, is that the PaIace<br>of Supporting Earth?

465
00:33:09,977 --> 00:33:11,251
Yes.

466
00:33:12,363 --> 00:33:14,931
Where is Nian Fei?

467
00:33:14,968 --> 00:33:17,102
She's living well in the palace.

468
00:33:18,403 --> 00:33:22,143
That's right.. she's still living well.

469
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:28,880
Greetings to the Empress. Greetings to Mistress An.

470
00:33:28,913 --> 00:33:33,400
Niangniang, I have heard from Jiang Luhai that Qi Fei is

471
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,000
punishing Lady Wan in the corridor by slapping her face.

472
00:33:38,219 --> 00:33:40,379
Has His Majesty heard?

473
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:42,314
His Majesty is still with the government.

474
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,600
There's no need to tell the government what's happening in the palace.

475
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,100
If His Majesty doesn't even care about it, why should I?

476
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,100
Empress Niangniang, Wan Ping is truly pitiful.

477
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,700
can you ask Qi Fei to stop?

478
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,200
If you pity her, who will pity you?

479
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,300
If I show compassion for her, so will His Majesty.

480
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,800
When that happens, you will lose all of your favor!

481
00:34:10,843 --> 00:34:12,300
I understand.

482
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,600
Go quickly. Don't stare.

483
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,100
Niangniang, it's been 2 hours. Please get up.

484
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,700
I'm sorry you've suffered, Niangniang, <br>our Niangniang is not usually like this.

485
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:11,100
Your kind heart will bring you good fortunes.

486
00:35:17,017 --> 00:35:19,086
Please let this humble servant help you home.

487
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,300
Don't bother.

488
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,200
Lady, massage your face with egg;

489
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,700
it heIps with the sweIIing.

490
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,100
She's bullying you too much.

491
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,000
I will go tell the Empress.

492
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:08,600
I was kneeling there for hours. How could she not know?

493
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:12,606
If she was going to come she would have.

494
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,648
Why do you allow her to do this, mistress? <br>You might as well break with her anyway.

495
00:36:18,148 --> 00:36:19,608
Break with her?

496
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,300
Who do I think I am now? Can I afford to?

497
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,600
Fucha Guiren was right.

498
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,700
The pain on the body reflects the pain in the heart.

499
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:45,000
Liu-Zhu, ask Xiao Yun-Zi<br>to catch some butterfIies.

500
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,000
Mistress, it's not the season for butterflies.

501
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,200
That's right... butterflies are out of the season.

502
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,400
But I must have them. The most beautiful ones.

503
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,000
Yes, mistress.

504
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,700
Huan-bi, bring me my powdered make up.

505
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,000
Mistress, we've used it all.

506
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,400
Go get some from the Internal Affairs office then.

507
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,200
The Luizi eyebrow color is also used up?

508
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,300
We've used it up.

509
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:21,420
Never mind.

510
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,288
These days I shouldn't be using Luizi anyway.

511
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,300
Just bring the regular kind that you use.

512
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,900
I'll go get it now.

513
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,900
Xiao Yun-Zi, there's a butterfIy!

514
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,700
Where?

515
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:46,523
There!

516
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,000
it's a dead butterfIy.

517
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:59,500
What's the use even if it's living? <br>It's gray and ugly. What good is it?

518
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,100
I can't even complete a task this simple. <br>I'm so useless!

519
00:38:02,438 --> 00:38:04,440
Where are we supposed to find butterflies in this season anyhow?

520
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,900
Actually I know a place.

521
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:06,773
Where?

522
00:38:06,773 --> 00:38:08,434
There's a hot springs at PaIace of Forever PeacefuI.

523
00:38:08,488 --> 00:38:10,323
it's warm there, and there are still many fIowers,

524
00:38:10,347 --> 00:38:11,584
So there are sure to still be butterflies.

525
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:14,355
But we can't leave this palace for there.

526
00:38:15,352 --> 00:38:17,487
And besides, during this season no one else is likely to go there.

527
00:38:19,901 --> 00:38:21,627
You keep looking.

528
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,400
You too. I'II be back.

529
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,200
Miss Huan-Bi aIways comes in siIentIy<br>as if she's trying to scare people on purpose.

530
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:55,400
My lord, if A Jing keeps saying that, I won't dare come again.

531
00:38:55,494 --> 00:38:57,098
Leave us.

532
00:38:57,121 --> 00:38:59,400
Has something happened at the House of Broken Jade?

533
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,200
Well well, don't speak at all please.

534
00:39:02,336 --> 00:39:04,600
Last time you came and cried and asked for a favor,

535
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:06,237
to advise Wan Niangniang.

536
00:39:06,307 --> 00:39:08,085
What is it now?

537
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:12,231
Nonsense.

538
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,600
Just tell me what's happening.

539
00:39:14,677 --> 00:39:20,426
My lord, I don't know what happened to my mistress. <br>She's asked us to get butterflies for her.

540
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,500
But where are we supposed to find butterflies this time of year?

541
00:39:24,457 --> 00:39:29,530
I'm just worried that last time, your advice didn't work<br> and she's too upset and not thinking straight.

542
00:39:30,527 --> 00:39:34,525
Has she asked for anything other than butterflies?

543
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,406
Not much else.

544
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:46,549
If butterflies can help her feel better, then I'll try my best to get some for her.

545
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,500
But besides that, you must stay with her.

546
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,900
it's aImost winter.<br>How can we catch butterfIies?

547
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,400
I heard there are hot springs in PaIace of<br>Forever PeacefuI, so it's warm.<br>Maybe you can find some there?

548
00:39:58,453 --> 00:40:01,346
Then I'II go to the PaIace of Forever PeacefuI.<br>it's not hard at all.
