1
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:09,736
The weather is cold

2
00:00:09,736 --> 00:00:11,883
The weather is cold. <br> The Imperial Household is sending the

3
00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:13,577
winter clothes

4
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:16,047
Tell manager Jiang

5
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:19,969
that we don't want the clothes

6
00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:24,233
Sure. <br> Ask him to send more flowers.

7
00:00:24,273 --> 00:00:29,369
Yes <br> Jiang Zhong Min is grateful, so he knows to repay us.

8
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,830
wanted to get

9
00:00:36,632 --> 00:00:43,699
The warm house needs more charcoal <br> You have to send flowers to here three times in a day <br> Yes

10
00:00:43,703 --> 00:00:45,703
You must do it on your own

11
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:45,982
Don't worry

12
00:00:45,982 --> 00:00:46,982
are the clothes I wanted done?

13
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:49,131
Are the clothes I wanted done? <br>Yes

14
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:51,838
Go and get it.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The cloak according to your order

16
00:00:58,176 --> 00:01:01,677
This is the color of sky

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,772
Yes, This is what I wanted

18
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:14,701
Finally you have the heart to make up <br> That's because

19
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:24,836
I didn't have somebody to cheer me up<br> And do my job as a mother

20
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:26,575
Have you seen the light?

21
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:29,462
Yes thank you Sister for teaching me.

22
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:37,656
Good then, let's be quick

23
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:51,435
and I acted recklessly

24
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:52,501
and I acted recklessly

25
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:05,574
I hope that,

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:09,900
Your Majesty can show mercy

27
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:10,593
Your Majesty can show mercy

28
00:02:10,593 --> 00:02:10,997
Your Majesty can show mercy

29
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,766
Your Majesty can show mercy,

30
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:20,232
for the sake of our relationship.

31
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:26,610
Song-Zhi, hand this letter to Su Pei-Sheng

32
00:02:27,662 --> 00:02:29,637
and ask him to send it to His Majesty.

33
00:02:30,503 --> 00:02:34,036
You have suffered for His Majesty's sake.

34
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:39,782
It doesn't matter,

35
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:45,310
I don't want His Majesty,

36
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,969
to leave me alone here.

37
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:57,905
I heard that <br>His Majesty did the same to Concubine Wan.

38
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:00,242
Serves her right.

39
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:07,788
I don't care so much, I just hope that His Majesty still cares for me.

40
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:15,710
Still not soft enough, needs to cook longer.

41
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:22,374
You are overdoing it a small fire will do. The chicken will not be tasty if you cook it for too long.

42
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:28,777
Look after this and then add more flavouring. Young Mistress does not look well. She needs more nutrition.

43
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:40,172
Huan Bi, help me to move this butterly

44
00:03:40,172 --> 00:03:42,504
Huan Bi, help me to move this butterly

45
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,900
It smells good!

46
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,109
Yes, of course the cloak

47
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,852
smells nice. We put the scent into this cloak

48
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:55,232
Look after the charcoal fire and take care of the butterflies

49
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:10,108
Your Majesty,

50
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,700
Why do you sigh?

51
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,000
I am reading Consort Nian's appeal letter,

52
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,500
I was reminded of our past relationship,

53
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,000
I feel sad.

54
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,200
Both of you have been a couple

55
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,500
Your Majesty is a caring soul, remembering your love is understandable.

56
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,900
Wan Ping must have recovered

57
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,300
from losing her son.

58
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,900
If Your Majesty misses Consort Nian then do go visit.

59
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't have the heart to see Concubine Wan,

60
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,400
moreover, Consort Nian.

61
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,000
Forget it.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,800
I always hated using my beauty to please others,

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,100
But,I can only use it to attract him.

64
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,143
I heard Consort Nian wrote an appeal letter to His Majesty a few days ago.

65
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
His Majesty was moved,

66
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,700
but he has not decided just yet

67
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,500
She was hot previously

68
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,000
Sooner or later Consort Nian will be restored.

69
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,900
When that happens, everything will be tough.

70
00:05:38,315 --> 00:05:41,352
It is snowing.

71
00:05:41,356 --> 00:05:42,957
Yes

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,100
His majesty always stayed here.

73
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,000
This year the first snow fall is late.

74
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,100
Though late, it is a heavy one.

75
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,000
It means next year will be a good year.

76
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,400
Concubine Wan is not here?

77
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,200
Early this morning, she had sent Jin-Xi to inform that she is not well.

78
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,400
So I told her to rest for a few more days.

79
00:06:21,497 --> 00:06:24,056
No wonder it seems there are less people.

80
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,100
Lady Cao is also not here because Princess Wen-yi is afraid of the cold.

81
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,100
Your Majesty, Lady Hui is not here either.

82
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,400
She is never late,

83
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:38,991
why is she late today?

84
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,900
It is possible that it is hard to travel in the snow

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Greetings Your Majesty, Greetings, Empress

86
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,000
I am sorry I am late. I beg pardon from Your Majesty and Empress.

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,087
It is ok, please rise.

88
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,546
Thank you, Your Majesty.

89
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,100
Why are you late today? Is anything the matter?

90
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,900
I was over at Yi Mei Garden and saw the blooming flowers

91
00:07:05,914 --> 00:07:09,034
and therefore I am late.

92
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,700
Have the flowers bloom?

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,800
Yes, and they are very pretty.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,200
Lady Hui, it is a waste to miss such a scene

95
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:23,660
why don't you accompany me to see it?

96
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,200
Yes, I will.

97
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,500
Your Majesty, don't leave us alone here.

98
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,300
Do bring us all along.

99
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,000
Move to the garden.

100
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,300
Your Ladyship, Lady Hui has brought His Majesty here.

101
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,500
I am so sorry that I

102
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,500
was not capable to protect the baby,

103
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,900
I sincerely

104
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,300
wish His Majesty,

105
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,000
to have a long life, I am willing to take only vegetarian food

106
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,000
if my wish comes true.

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Huan Huan,

108
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,900
is that you?

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,300
I am sorry I can't meet Your Majesty.

110
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,600
Why aren't you looking at me?

111
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,400
Don't you want to see me anymore?

112
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,300
Your Majesty, please don't come any closer.

113
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,400
You told me this before.

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Your Majesty still remembers it

115
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,300
But I dare not keep it in my mind.

116
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,900
Your hands are cold,

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,100
aren't you afraid of catching a cold?

118
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,400
I have prayed for Your Majesty sincerely.

119
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,900
But if I caused Your Majesty to worry about me, it is my fault.

120
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,700
I will leave first.

121
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,100
Look! Her body is full of butterflies!

122
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,100
She is using magic

123
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,200
It is winter, where did the butterflies come from?

124
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Even butterflies are attracted to you.

125
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,500
I have no idea either.

126
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,600
If you fall sick because you have been praying for me,

127
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,900
it would cause me more heartache.

128
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,500
Your body smells very nice,

129
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,100
No wonder even the butterflies are attracted to you in winter.

130
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,100
You have intoxicated me too.

131
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,700
I have been washing my body

132
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,100
in order to pray for Your Majesty.

133
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,000
That's good,

134
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,252
Concubine Wan has kept to her room since her miscarriage

135
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,300
I have been worried for a few months

136
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,700
I have been praying for Your Majesty and Sister to get together

137
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,800
That the two of you can be

138
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,300
reconciled

139
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,600
Finally my wish has come true.

140
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,800
When did I have any conflict with Huan Huan?

141
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Never

142
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:35,155
It is just that I am not well,

143
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
I can't serve Your Majesty

144
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,400
You should be happy now

145
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,900
We are all serving our masters

146
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,000
As servants, our lives will be good if our masters are happy

147
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,500
I have always spoken good things of Concubine Wan to His Majesty.

148
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,200
Save it,

149
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,800
As long as it is good for the Emperor, you will benefit too.

150
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,900
Moreover this time it is Lady Hui's efforts.

151
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,900
It is weird

152
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:25,597
Why is Lady Hui helping Concubine Wan but not herself?

153
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,100
Since she has been well, she has not gotten the same attention from His Majesty like in the past.

154
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,000
Stay outside.

155
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,600
It might be a small matter to make life difficult for Concubine Wan the other day

156
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:47,962
But you had to humiliate her.

157
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:52,468
Now Concubine Wan has gained the Emperor's favour again

158
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,100
Look at how it is today.

159
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,800
Once His Majesty had seen her, everyone ceases to exist.

160
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:01,912
Do you think we will have a good life after this?

161
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,900
Why are you worried?

162
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,700
Every woman in the palace has been favoured and has also lost favour

163
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,900
Moreover she is a Concubine while I am a Lady

164
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
You are a Consort.

165
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,200
There are two of us and one of her. Why do you need to be afraid?

166
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:20,000
Do you think we will win by having more people on our side?

167
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,600
I don't think Concubine Wan will be nice to us

168
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,100
But you are a Consort, to discipline the women in the palace is expected.

169
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,700
Moreover there is no evidence of the peach matter.

170
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,100
Concubine Wan can't do us any harm

171
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,700
Who knows?

172
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,400
Just accept fate.

173
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Your Ladyship must be tired

174
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,100
Do rest earlier

175
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,000
Yes I am tired

176
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,900
But I do not feel like sleeping yet

177
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,800
Why is the charcoal so hot?

178
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,900
The charcoal did not change, but time changes everything.

179
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,100
Your mood is different therefore you feel that the charcoal is hotter

180
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I used to think the words of His Majesty were the most important things.

181
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,700
But now

182
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,300
it cannot even hold a candle to this charcoal.

183
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,000
I once wished to have someone to love me

184
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,200
and never to part

185
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,900
but it is just my wishful thinking.

186
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,100
No matter, the fact is that His Majesty cares very much for you.

187
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,000
That's why

188
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,600
I know these are wishful thinking

189
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,300
His Majesty treats me such, he will also treat others the same.

190
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,100
i have no way

191
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,400
but to use schemes to get what I want

192
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,400
Your Ladyship has been sick for so long and has kept all these in her heart

193
00:14:56,433 --> 00:15:02,391
Now that you have said it out loud and with no more vexation in your heart, you will not suffer anymore

194
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,000
Your Ladyship, they are going to lock the gates. Let's sleep now too.

195
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,800
I wonder if we can sleep peacefully.

196
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,100
Your Ladyship, His Majesty is here.

197
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,600
Don't let him in,

198
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,300
Tell his majesty that I have slept.

199
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:22,361
Yes.

200
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,900
Who are you?

201
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Huan-Huan are you sleeping?

202
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,800
Why is Your Majesty here so late?

203
00:15:52,843 --> 00:15:55,477
I am about to sleep.

204
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,700
Huan-Huan, are you better?

205
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,000
I want to see you so that I will not be worried.

206
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,322
I can't greet Your Majesty now.

207
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,300
So I can't keep Your Majesty company. I beg Your Majesty to forgive me.

208
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:17,500
Huan-Huan, let me go in and see you, just to see you.

209
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,300
If you are fine, I will be at ease then.

210
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,200
Your Majesty has to hold court early tomorrow morning so you should not sleep late.

211
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,219
I am almost sleeping.

212
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,600
If I were to get up, it might make my condition worse.

213
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,000
And I won't be able to get well sooner to serve Your Majesty.

214
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:37,031
Please spare a thought for me.

215
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,900
Then I'll go back.

216
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,600
Xiao Yun-Zi

217
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,200
Yes

218
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,800
Send His Majesty back

219
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:47,698
Yes

220
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,400
Goodbye Your Majesty.

221
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,300
Get me the water, we can sleep now.

222
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,600
Your Ladyship, it is snowing heavily outside.

223
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,200
His Majesty had come over, why did you not want to see him?

224
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,900
Even if His Majesty comes tomorrow, I still won't see him.

225
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,400
Your Majesty, it is late.

226
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:27,997
Which palace would you wish to go to retire for the night?

227
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,800
I think Lady An is not asleep yet.

228
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,600
Or perhaps you can go to the Empress or Lady Hui.

229
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,000
No, not going to any of them.

230
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,600
I am going back to the Hall of Mental Cultivation.

231
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,676
Yes

232
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,300
Go

233
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,600
House of Concentrating Glow

234
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,300
Yes, House of Concentrating Glow.

235
00:17:54,582 --> 00:17:58,870
You had said you were asking me to stay the night in the palace because I had drunk too much

236
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:03,306
But it seems you have trouble sleeping and so you wanted someone to chat with you?

237
00:18:03,575 --> 00:18:04,620
Stop bringing this up

238
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:07,420
I was chased away by everyone

239
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:11,064
Brother, you have a lot of wives

240
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,485
Yes

241
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:17,668
But when I wanted to go to the House of the Broken Jade

242
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:21,954
They all pushed me away

243
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:25,501
Concubine Wan said that she wasn't feeling well and so could not serve me.

244
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:28,067
She didn't even want to see me

245
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:32,547
Concubine Wan cares about you, I don't think she said anything wrong

246
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:36,162
I know, but...

247
00:18:37,371 --> 00:18:39,332
It seems like the butterflies of Concubine Wan

248
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:41,491
Have flew into your heart.

249
00:18:41,724 --> 00:18:44,421
I don't know how these butterflies came about

250
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:47,192
But no matter

251
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,538
It's fine as long as she is true to me.

252
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:54,865
You don't know how stubborn she is

253
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,753
She has been avoiding me for a few months

254
00:18:58,753 --> 00:19:01,544
Simply because I refused to punish Consort Nian

255
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:03,276
She is petty little girl.

256
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:05,776
But it is because she is a petty little girl

257
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:08,345
That makes her charming.

258
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:11,747
Who says people who are not married wouldn't understand.

259
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:16,185
I have been with Your Majesty for so many years

260
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,943
Other than Empress Chun-Yuan

261
00:19:19,262 --> 00:19:22,063
I have never heard Your Majesty talk about any girl like this

262
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:25,432
No matter how difficult the state affairs are

263
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:29,536
We will still have a way to solve it

264
00:19:30,076 --> 00:19:33,231
But it is more energy consuming

265
00:19:35,116 --> 00:19:38,120
To fight with a smart woman.

266
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:44,695
Therefore stupid but obedient women

267
00:19:45,132 --> 00:19:46,380
are the cutest

268
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:51,715
But it is not definite that you will love cute women

269
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:56,316
You are really a good partner to chat with

270
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:00,710
Just take your time

271
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:02,585
Since you like Concubinet Wan

272
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:06,945
You can solve this in a short period of time

273
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,667
Since Concubine Wan has prejudices with you

274
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,289
Why don't you accommodate her

275
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,266
Su Pei-Sheng

276
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:26,916
Your Majesty

277
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:28,675
You're still awake?

278
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,255
Isn't it morning yet?

279
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:31,757
It is almost morning

280
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:34,034
It will be morning in four hours' time.

281
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:35,748
I am going to sleep

282
00:20:39,431 --> 00:20:41,185
Extinguish two more candles

283
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:42,073
Yes

284
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:49,023
His Majesty is here

285
00:20:52,064 --> 00:20:54,073
Greetings your Majesty

286
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:55,302
Please rise.

287
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,830
Thank you your Majesty

288
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:03,538
Your majesty just finished your court hearings

289
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,674
Is there any vexation?

290
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:10,891
I have something to discuss with you

291
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:13,715
Since you are all here, listen to me as well.

292
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:18,955
This morning the Dzungaria sent people to propose marriage

293
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:23,671
So that their lord can marry our princess

294
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:25,426
and pacify the residents of Dzungaria

295
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,371
It is common for the princess of our country to marry outsider

296
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:32,099
We just need to pick a suitable girl from the palace

297
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,391
And honor her as princess

298
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:40,905
But the problem is they want a princess from the main royal family, not the branch family

299
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:44,730
Dzungaria belongs to Qing dynasty, It is a small tribe at the boundry of our country

300
00:21:45,044 --> 00:21:48,555
It is already an honor that our princess will marry them

301
00:21:48,977 --> 00:21:52,143
Yet they want more and more and insist on a princess from the main royal family!

302
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,231
They are really too much!

303
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:56,946
Normally we only choose princesses from the branch family

304
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:02,420
The only exception was when the previous emperor married his own daughter to Dzungaria

305
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:05,669
That's why it is hard for me to reject

306
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:07,572
As this example existed

307
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,238
Your Majesty, although Wen-Yi is your biological daughter, she is too young to marry!

308
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:15,356
I won't be bothered by this

309
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:18,856
If she is not underage

310
00:22:19,723 --> 00:22:23,828
You are clear about the condition in the government

311
00:22:24,228 --> 00:22:27,183
I have just come to the throne for about three years

312
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:29,914
And conquered the northwest

313
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:33,625
Dzungaria used to be violent

314
00:22:34,315 --> 00:22:36,791
We will have war again

315
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:38,880
If this thing can't be solved properly

316
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,465
We won't have enough supplies

317
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,500
If we have war now

318
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,800
It is really a bad idea

319
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,837
Your majesty is right

320
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,700
We have to look

321
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,900
at the big picture

322
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,000
Approving the proposal is the only way

323
00:23:02,003 --> 00:23:07,043
It's just that my princess Wen-Yi is too young

324
00:23:07,108 --> 00:23:11,012
I can't find a suitable person

325
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,800
Dzungaria only wants the princess from the main family

326
00:23:14,812 --> 00:23:17,122
They didn't ask for your Majesty's biological daughters

327
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,300
Do you mean

328
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,000
The youngest daughter of the previous emperor, Princess Zhao-Gui is single

329
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,300
Still in puberty, she is the most suitable person.

330
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,600
But she is my youngest sister

331
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,200
Your Majesty has constantly sacrificed himself for the country

332
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,000
So your sister should do the same.

333
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,900
Moreover Princess Zhao-Gui's mother is only a Lady in the Previous Emperor's court.

334
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,100
Even if Your Majesty were to arrange a marriage for her in the future, you will only pick a officer from the governmen

335
00:23:48,155 --> 00:23:53,042
It will not be as honorable as marrying Dzungaria.

336
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,200
Empress, you are right.

337
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,600
She is my only single sister.

338
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,900
I must plan for her

339
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
On further reflection

340
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,500
The Lord of Dzungaria is from a noble family.

341
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,200
As Zhao-Gui is our only choice

342
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,600
Then I will let Empress prepare everything.

343
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,000
She will marry Dzungaria ten days later.

344
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,300
Yes, I will do my best.

345
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,100
Since we are arranging her marriage

346
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,700
I will honor her as Princess Gu-Lun

347
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,000
So arrange the preparations according to this position

348
00:24:33,001 --> 00:24:34,312
Yes

349
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,300
It is might be easy to say the Imperial Household can handled the dowry.

350
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:42,352
But there are difficult aspects too, we can't afford to make any mistake

351
00:24:42,402 --> 00:24:45,413
Or it will embarrass the Qing dynasty.

352
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,400
Having too many people handling this may not be ideal, I think

353
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,000
Sister Cao is very meticulous

354
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,100
why don't we ask her to help the princess to prepare?

355
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,800
I really don't know anything about such matters

356
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I am afraid I will let Your Majesty's and Sister's good intentions down.

357
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You are suited to these tasks.

358
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,000
The rest will be handled by the Empress.

359
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,700
Yes.

360
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,900
I have to leave now

361
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,300
Goodbye, Your Majesty

362
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,800
You did not say anything for a while but in the end you suggested that Lady Cao should handle the dowry.

363
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,600
What are you thinking?

364
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,600
I did not say anything in the beginning because I don't approve of the marriage

365
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,541
But I can't change it either

366
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,300
I feel sad for Princess Zhao-Cui.

367
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,000
Yes, Dzungaria is a violent tribe.

368
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:38,432
It is fine if she can marry a good man.

369
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,500
But the Lord of Dzungaria is old, he is almost 60 years old.

370
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,000
Poor Princess is only in her puberty.

371
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,900
The Lord is old enough to be her grandfather.

372
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,000
But His Majesty needs her to marry Dzungaria

373
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,200
She can't avoid

374
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,456
this marriage.

375
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,800
Isn't Nian Gengyao a good warrior?

376
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:08,996
Why don't His Majesty let him go conquer Dzungaria?

377
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,300
Why do we have to send troops if the matter can be solved by a woman?

378
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,600
Nian Gengyao has great achievements in the military but if he loses, the price

379
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,400
would not be just a Princess.

380
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,900
If he wins,, he will have more power and might threaten His Majesty's position.

381
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,200
Therefore His Majesty has no other choice.

382
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,900
Did His Majesty look at you at all when he was here just now?

383
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,800
No, I am useless, I am unable to gain His Majesty's favour

384
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:40,043
It is not that you are useless, it is Concubine Wan who is too capable.

385
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,400
Without her, His Majesty was attentive to you.

386
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:47,444
But now she is back, His Majesty could not even remember you.

387
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,300
Sister has been away from His Majesty for a while so it is normal for him to look for her now.

388
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,900
What about the future?

389
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,600
Your days with His Majesty is not short either, do you still want him to care for you?

390
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,300
Yes, I await your Majesty's guidance.

391
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,400
Concubine Wan is still powerful when she was not the beloved of His Majesty

392
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,500
Do you still remember Lady Chun?

393
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,400
Being close to Concubine Wan and other consorts

394
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,600
is the long-term way

395
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,100
I understand.

396
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,200
Check

397
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,400
I lose.

398
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,700
Your Majesty has lost, so Your Majesty must stay here.

399
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,900
You have been chasing me away for days.

400
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,200
Finally you are letting me stay.

401
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,000
Since you like the House of Broken Jade so much, I will let you stay

402
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,400
You stay here Your Majesty. I will go over to Lady Hui's place for the night.

403
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Your Majesty lost the game and so you have to stay but I need not stay.

404
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,600
I have not fully recovered from my illness

405
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,100
Since Your Majesty wishes to stay here, I will have to go somewhere else.

406
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,300
You are not well, you stay.

407
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,300
I am going back to the Hall of Mental Cultivation.

408
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,800
Goodbye, Your Majesty

409
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,100
Your Ladyship, it is the fourth day

410
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,100
you are still chasing away His Majesty

411
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,500
Not letting him stay. There are so many rumors as a result.

412
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:57,000
So what? I don't care about rumors.

413
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,100
But isn't Your Ladyship worried that His Majesty may be so upset he will not return?

414
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,400
Did you hear the story of the wife of Emperor Wu of Han?

415
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,200
Emperor Wu of Han loved Madam Li because of her beauty

416
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,800
And before Emperor Wu died, he wanted to see her for the last time

417
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,200
But she had covered her face.

418
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:18,191
She did not allowed him to see her even when he was dead.

419
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,500
It is because she had become ugly

420
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,200
She was the nightmare of every woman in the palace.

421
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,100
The best thing is the thing that you have lost and cannot recover easily.

422
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,700
Her Ladyship keeps chasing His Majesty away

423
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,700
so as to entice him further.

424
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,500
Yes, you are right.

425
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,500
This is just a scheme.

426
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,500
But you should not overdo it.

427
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,900
Or your effort will be in vain

428
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,300
Princess is so pitiable. It is so quiet.

429
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,300
No one has come to her wedding ceremony.

430
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,000
It is obvious her position is not important, His Majesty has never cared for his sister.

431
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,800
Morever marrying her to an outsider means they will never meet again.

432
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,100
His Majesty has only one sister and he can bear to do so.

433
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,000
Even if it is his biological daughter

434
00:30:20,007 --> 00:30:23,000
His Majesty will have no choice.

435
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,700
I wonder who will be next?

436
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,200
Why did you not let me know you are here?

437
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,536
It shows I have no manners

438
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,700
I just sent Princess Zhao-Gui and her retinue away

439
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,900
I saw you sewing so seriously

440
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,900
I did not want to disturb you

441
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,300
I was just killing time

442
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,900
Is the Princess fine?

443
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,900
She cried very sadly

444
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,700
I did not want to part with her either.

445
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,000
So I came here.

446
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,400
What are you sewing?

447
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,700
I wanted to sew a sachet for Your Majesty

448
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
But I am slow, I have only just finished sewing the dragon,and have not decided what the color of the clouds should be.

449
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,300
Any colour will do

450
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,500
Your good intentions are more important.

451
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,900
Everything about Your Majesty must be perfect

452
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Just like what you said, the sachet represents my good intentions.

453
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:58,513
So I cannot take this lightly

454
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,600
I like the light purple color of your clothes.

455
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,900
It matches the golden dragon.

456
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,100
Purple clouds and golden dragon

457
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,000
Indeed a really propitious sign.

458
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,400
When you finished sewing,

459
00:32:19,424 --> 00:32:24,001
I will carry the sachet on me every day

460
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,300
Never let it out of my sight.

461
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,000
Alright?

462
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,700
Niang Niang

463
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,500
Is His Majesty staying at the House of Mental Cultivation today

464
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,000
or meeting Lady An?

465
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,500
Or is he staying at the House of Broken Jade?

466
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,900
Yes

467
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,100
Did't you say that woman has been rejecting His Majesty?

468
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,200
Yes, I heard that

469
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,000
But now it seems she has allowed him to stay.

470
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,600
She is acting and scheming to seduce His Majesty

471
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,077
Niang Niang, don't get angry, think of your health.

472
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,900
You have put in too much incense

473
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Making you cough.

474
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,400
Is it a lot?

475
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,100
Why didn't I smell anything?

476
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,000
Why can't I smell anything?

477
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Oh

478
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:25,000
His Majesty isn't here so the smell isn't here either.

479
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,900
Concubine Wan has recovered, she can serve His Majesty again.

480
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,900
I am happy to see that too.

481
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,700
Thank you, Empress

482
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,600
Your Majesty, Consort Nian is outside, she wants to greet you.

483
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,700
It is cold outside, tell her to go back.

484
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,500
She does not need to greet me.

485
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:52,200
Consort Nian knows Your Majesty does not want to see her so she just wish to come in and kowtow to you at a distance.

486
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,100
Let her come in and kowtow a greeting then.

487
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:00,000
It is almost at yearend, let her do this to fulfill her wish.

488
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,800
Then she does not need to come anymore.

489
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,200
Let her enter.

490
00:35:03,203 --> 00:35:03,971
Yes

491
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,300
His Majesty calls Consort Nian to enter.

492
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,600
Greeting Your Majesty

493
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,000
Please rise.

494
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,800
Thank you, Your Majesty

495
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:34,500
I dare not ask Your Majesty for forgiveness but I have copied many scriptures when I was alone.

496
00:35:34,511 --> 00:35:37,872
I have sent them to the temple for the monks to read

497
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Hopefully it can bless Your Majesty.

498
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,800
I understand your good intentions. You can go back.

499
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,000
Yes

500
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,600
Concubine Wan is here too.

501
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,600
So many people

502
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,200
I will leave first.

503
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,200
The weather is cold. Continue with the copying of the scriptures when spring comes.

504
00:36:19,395 --> 00:36:21,045
Yes

505
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:27,700
You look good in purple yesterday, why don't you let the Imperial Household make more purple clothes for you?

506
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

507
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,300
Sister, you finally got what you wanted

508
00:36:35,334 --> 00:36:37,513
I was really worried about you.

509
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,000
Sister is too kind.

510
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,300
If you worry about me, come visit me often then.

511
00:36:43,308 --> 00:36:44,985
That's true.

512
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,100
When Concubine Wan is sick, His Majesty will look for you

513
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,500
Where would you have the time to visit your sister?

514
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,000
What are you looking at?

515
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,900
I was just thinking the year is ending soon.

516
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
If your Majesty can spend more time with Princess Wen-yi

517
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,600
she will be very happy

518
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,800
According to today's situation, although His Majesty did not pardon Consort Nian,

519
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,000
He did not punish her heavily either.

520
00:37:29,009 --> 00:37:32,362
She still has the chance to come back

521
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,200
I knew that when I lost my baby

522
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,200
As long as Nian Genyao is in power, the Nian's family will not fall

523
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,100
No matter what Consort Nian does

524
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,200
His Majesty will not and dare not kill her.

525
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,500
It seems they are more powerful than His Majesty

526
00:37:47,553 --> 00:37:50,980
His Majesty has no choice but to bear it.

527
00:37:50,984 --> 00:37:52,962
I don't understand all this

528
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:56,493
But what is going on between you and Ling-Rong?

529
00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:59,382
I feel that both of you are not as close as before

530
00:37:59,783 --> 00:38:03,422
That's because we hardly meet now

531
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,000
If it is because of His Majesty, it is not worth it.

532
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,100
I saw that she seems to be trying to accommodate you today.

533
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,000
Is it worth it?

534
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,900
Ling-Rong is very good at sussing out the situation.

535
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,700
We will know the person's true nature after some time

536
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
If it is because of His Majesty, it is not worth it

537
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,600
But if it is for some other reason, you have to sort it out then.

538
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:42,600
The three of us came to the palace together, to be where we are today, it has not been easy.

539
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,400
If she has done anything wrong, if we can compromise, we should.

540
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,400
Luckily Sister still treats me as before.

541
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,400
The snow has stopped. I will go visit the Empress Dowager.

542
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,800
The road is slippery. Be careful.

543
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,200
Ji-Xi, let's go to the Imperial Garden for a walk.

544
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,700
Huan-Bi, you go back first.

545
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:27,200
I rarely meet both of you.

546
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,000
I was just thinking the snowy landscape is so pretty

547
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,500
it is sad to enjoy it alone.

548
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:38,700
It would be better to enjoy the scene with both of you.

549
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,300
I was about to go see Wen-yi but as I have not seen you for a while, i will remain.

550
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,900
How about Lady Fuca? I had promised to watch an opera with Consort Qi.

551
00:39:46,914 --> 00:39:52,978
So I am not free.

552
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,400
If you are not free, that is fine but some people might think that you had committed some offensive crimes

553
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,300
then that would be bad.
