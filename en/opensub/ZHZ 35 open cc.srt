00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Episode 35

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,400
Both of you, please have a seat.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,400
The birds disappear in the winter.

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,900
Although it's not as lively as spring,

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,100
winter has its own atmosphere.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,100
Indeed.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,700
What's your opinion, Sister?

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,900
Consort Wan invited me to appreciate the beauty of the snow.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,100
I only know how to watch the snow.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,200
Are you saying that I'm forcing you?

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,900
Actually, it's good for us to meet regularly, and talk.

12
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,278
So we'll become closer, and avoid any misunderstandings.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,300
We're both Imperial concubines of the Emperor.

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,296
We shouldn't have any misunderstandings or rifts.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,700
I remember a story that happened during wintertime.

16
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:56,940
Imperial Consort Wan is learned and educated. I'm glad if you can share it with me.

17
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,100
It's the story of homunculus.

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,600
I'm neither learned nor educated,

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,100
as I cannot remember the story well.

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,564
It happened during the reign of Emperor Han.

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,400
Madam Qi offended Empress Lu as she was pampered by the Emperor.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,940
After Empress Lu became Empress Dowager,

23
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,259
she cut off Madam Qi's hands and legs,

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,800
gouged her eyes, cut her ears, and gave her drugs to keep her mute.

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,300
Then she was locked in the toilet. This is called "Homunculus".

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,300
Madam Qi was a beautiful lady.

27
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,600
Unfortunately she ended up that way.

28
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:29,635
Even though Empress Lu was very cruel,

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,300
Madam Qi insulted the Empress because she was pampered.

30
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,000
She could only blame herself.

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,800
As a Lady, Empress Lu tended to hold deep grudges.

32
00:01:41,136 --> 00:01:45,280
Sister Fuca, am I right?

33
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,100
- Jin-Xi.<br>- Young Master.

34
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,900
- Quick, help Lady Fuca to her chair.<br>- Yes.

35
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,600
That is an interesting story.

36
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,400
What happened to you, Sister?

37
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,300
Perhaps Lady Fuca didn't think I told the story very well.

38
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,200
I was telling the story indiscriminately. Perhaps that made you more confused.

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,000
What is the purpose of you telling me this story of homunculus?

40
00:02:07,553 --> 00:02:12,440
Although Consort Nian is arbitrary and despotic, there is one thing that impresses me about her.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,600
She is very decisive and shows no mercy.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,700
Someone who insulted Consort Nian was transferred to another palace.

43
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,700
I'm wondering what she will do if she is bullied at Long Street.

44
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,400
If what you say is true, given Consort Nian's temperament,

45
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,800
she would administer the homunculus punishment,

46
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,900
or some other agonizing punishment.

47
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,200
Yes, if I were as cruel as Consort Nian,

48
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,700
I wouldn't allow myself to be bullied after I become the Imperial Consort.

49
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,700
Sister, you are pampered by the Emperor.

50
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,900
You can do anything you like.

51
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,700
Consort Wan, I was wrong. Please forgive me. I promise never to do that again.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,200
Sister, you used to have great confidence in yourself. What is your mistake?

53
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,000
I was just telling you a story.

54
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,400
- I was instructed by Consort Qi. Please forgive me.<br>- Really?

55
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,900
Whatever it is, let's talk about it later.

56
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,600
I'm curious. Although Sima Qian is good in writing,

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,700
he doesn't know what homunculus looks like.

58
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,100
As far as I know, homunculus is not the worst way.

59
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,500
During the Tang Dynasty, concubines were made into homunculus.

60
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,300
Then they were soaked in the wine jar.

61
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,600
This is called Bone in Wine.

62
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,700
Even though it was cruel,

63
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,300
everything happened for a reason. They should have expected it.

64
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,500
Young Master. What has happened to you? Young Master, please wake up.

65
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,600
I thought she was brave,

66
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:02,748
but all along, she was a coward, pretending to be brave.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,500
Jin-Xi, Lady Fuca is not feeling well. Carry her home.

68
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,400
- Young Master.<br>- Someone, please?

69
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,100
Come here, over here.

70
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,300
- Carry her home.<br>- Yes.

71
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,500
Aunt, do we need to ask for the Imperial doctor to come?

72
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,600
Ask the Imperial doctor to come, but no need to pay too much attention.

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,300
Yes.

74
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,200
Kill the chicken to warn the monkey.

75
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:48,500
The chicken is dead now. What do you want to tell us?

76
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,900
It's good to talk with a smart person like yourself, Sister Cao. I don't need to waste my time.

77
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,100
You are not a cruel, tricky person.

78
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,700
If Lady Fuca really offended you, you could have sent her to the Ministry of Justice.

79
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,400
You don't need to trouble yourself.

80
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,300
The purpose of the things you did, was it to scare me?

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,100
Therefore, please be straight-forward.

82
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,900
Sister Cao thinks too much, and likes to speak in a roundabout way.

83
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,800
I feel uneasy for myself,

84
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,100
to be straight-forward with you.

85
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,700
You've had a cold for the past few days.

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,700
I made a suggestion to the Emperor to visit you. How are you feeling now?

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,300
I appreciate what you did.

88
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,600
But when the Emperor is with me, his heart is with you.

89
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,204
He looked restless.

90
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,000
Sister Cai is a smart person. You don't need to care about that.

91
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:48,055
The relationship will improve if you meet each other on a regular basis.

92
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,800
As long as the Emperor visits you,

93
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,700
he will come to like you more, due to your intelligence.

94
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:59,123
Consort Nian fell from grace, and got you into trouble.

95
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,200
The Emperor hasn't visited you for half a year. Am I right?

96
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:08,157
I don't have good fortune. It makes sense that the Emperor isn't concerned about me.

97
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,900
Actually, it's not a big deal for me to be treated wrongly.

98
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:12,863
The important thing is the Princess.

99
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,600
If she isn't cherished by her father from a young age,

100
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,900
what's going to happen to her in the future?

101
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,300
I've been so short-sighted.

102
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,900
I didn't make the right choice,

103
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,900
and that has caused this current situation.

104
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,700
I don't blame anyone for that.

105
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,400
You shouldn't repent or redress your errors.

106
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,600
You need to fight for the Princess' future.

107
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,100
As for what happened in the past,

108
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,500
you shouldn't consider yourself short-sighted for choosing to follow Consort Nian.

109
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,900
It's not easy to follow her.

110
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,400
But people think you still follow Consort Nian.

111
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,500
What should we do?

112
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,600
I also worry about what's going to happen in the future.

113
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,400
I hope that Consort Nian doesn't involve me.

114
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,800
Consort Nian is impatient and cruel.

115
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:03,689
You're not happy with her, right?

116
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:06,216
Regarding the cassava flour matter the other day,

117
00:07:06,282 --> 00:07:08,476
you knew that I was innocent.

118
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,700
You should know who took advantage of the Princess to create trouble.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,700
Princess Wen-Yi is to be pitied, suffering at such a young age.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,200
I feel sorry for her.

121
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,800
As a mother, you are forced to watch the sufferings of your own child.

122
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,400
I believe you are more miserable.

123
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,800
Without Consort Nian's help,

124
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:33,650
I wouldn't have been able to deliver a princess.

125
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,100
You showed your gratitude towards her.

126
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,400
But what happened next? She took advantage of your daughter

127
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,100
to attract the Emperor's attention.

128
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,500
Actually, you are just as smart as Consort Nian.

129
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,200
You chose to follow her in order to protect yourself.

130
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:52,856
I knew Consort Nian was despotic, but there wasn't anything I could do about it.

131
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,474
I wanted to tell you that day,

132
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,100
so you would rescue Lady Chun, when she fell into the pool,

133
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,100
but it was too late.

134
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,200
You are very intelligent and understanding.

135
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,800
You knew that Consort Nian is not reliable.

136
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,400
So you were willing to secretly help me.

137
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,500
I appreciate what you did.

138
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,228
I was just following orders.

139
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,700
Even with all my efforts, I can't fight against Consort Nian.

140
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Unfortunately, I still couldn't save Lady Chun.

141
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,500
I want to ask you a question.

142
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,700
How did Lady Chun slip and fall down that day?

143
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,500
If you in

144
00:08:39,468 --> 00:08:43,361
Consort Nian was jealous of Lady Chun being pampered.

145
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:45,223
Also, Lady Chun was very close to you.

146
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:47,839
Consort Nian wanted to cut your wings.

147
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,300
She is so impatient.

148
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,600
She wasn't afraid the Emperor would investigate?

149
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,900
Consort Nian is arrogant.

150
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:57,711
It's not a big deal for her to kill a concubine.

151
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,800
She was able kill her without a trace.

152
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,200
That day, Lady Chun went to pick up a kite,

153
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,800
and accidentally discovered the relationship between Consort Nian and General Nian's subordinate.

154
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:10,175
That's why Consort Nian killed her.

155
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,100
It is acceptable if Consort Nian wants to meet with General Nian's subordinate.

156
00:09:14,206 --> 00:09:16,363
She didn't need to meet him in secret.

157
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,100
Consort Nian has always been lavish.

158
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:21,397
So she has a difficult time when she is short of money.

159
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,800
When she needs money, she will write down the name of the officer who bribes

160
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,867
and ask someone to pass it to General Nian secretly.

161
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,000
The reason Zhao Zhi-Yuan is re-established in an important position is because he bribed Consort Nian.

162
00:09:34,154 --> 00:09:36,262
She dares to collude with Nian Gengyao?

163
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,731
And influence Imperial's personnel decisions?

164
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,700
Yes, Nian Gengyao's subordinates are colluding with each other and formed a gang.

165
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,700
You used to be against because you had no other choice.

166
00:09:47,743 --> 00:09:49,250
I understand that.

167
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,000
You're contributed a lot as you delivered and raised the Princess.

168
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,700
Unfortunately, you have stayed with Consort Nian for many years,

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
but still are not as important as Consort Li,

170
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,600
who doesn't have any children at all.

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,500
The status of the mother is going to influence the future of her children.

172
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,500
You may not know, but the Emperor told me something about Princess Zhao Gui yesterday.

173
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,400
She was married to Dzungaria for about two weeks,

174
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,800
when Inge Khan died suddenly.

175
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,300
Her husband died? That means she's coming back soon, right?

176
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,700
She'll be lucky if she's allowed to come back.

177
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,600
She might have to follow the traditional customs of Dzungaria, and marry the new leader,

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,100
who is the new khan, who has ascended the throne.

179
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:31,473
That can't be.

180
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,598
A woman's duty is to carry on the ancestral line.

181
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,300
Even if Princess does not want to, she must follow the customs.

182
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,800
She can be downgraded from Empress to Concubine.

183
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm willing to do anything for you,

184
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,901
provided that you protect me and my daughter.

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,900
I would really appreciate your help.

186
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,200
I have admired you for a long time.

187
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,900
Finally, we're able to know each other better today.

188
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,800
Of course I'm willing to protect you.

189
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,700
If you feel cold, lie on the bed and rest.

190
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
I will make you a hot-water bottle for warmth.

191
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,922
Bao-Juan, do you think that everyone is laughing at me now?

192
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,600
Young Master, don't think about it too much.

193
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,500
Previously, I was so impressive.

194
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,000
Many people were jealous of me.

195
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,500
Now Consort Wan has won the favor secretly.

196
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,400
She doesn't treat as well as she did before.

197
00:11:55,685 --> 00:11:57,287
Everyone must be laughing at me now.

198
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,500
The Emperor visits Consort Wan more often these last few days.

199
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,300
But I believe he hasn't forgotten about you.

200
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,200
Really? The Emperor always I'm good at singing.

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,800
But ever since Consort Wan, he has forgotten everything.

202
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,000
My nose, my ears.

203
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,200
My hands and legs disappeared.

204
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,600
Sister Fuca, what happened to you?

205
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,100
I don't want to be Homunculus. (Homunculus?) I don't want to be Homunculus.

206
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,300
Who wants you to be Homunculus?

207
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,900
She wants me to be Homunculus.

208
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,696
- No.<br>- Help me.

209
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:47,909
- No, no one will make you into Homunculus.<br>- I don't want to be Homunculus.

210
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,100
That will never happen.

211
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,000
Come here. What happened to Master Fuca?

212
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,400
Nothing special. A few days ago, she met Consort Wan and Lady Cao. She fainted there.

213
00:12:57,656 --> 00:13:01,100
She became like this after she woke up.

214
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,310
Consort Wan? She became like this because of Consort Wan?

215
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,700
That's not possible. Lady Cao was there too.

216
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,300
She didn't have any fear of her.

217
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,500
I don't want to be Homunculus. I don't want to be Homunculus.

218
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't want to be Homunculus.

219
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,803
Young Master, Lady Fuca is insane.

220
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,800
I heard that after Lady Fuca left us,

221
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:38,770
she became insane, and talked incoherently.

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,700
She stayed in bed and refused to go out.

223
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,900
- Does the Emperor know about this?<br>- Yes.

224
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,158
The palace is in confusion because of Lady Fuca.

225
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,000
The Emperor has instructed that she needs to stay in the palace, and is not allowed to go out.

226
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,200
An Imperial doctor is attending to her.

227
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,800
I thought she was brave.

228
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,000
But she's become like this because of a few words?

229
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,500
She did something wrong, and became insane by her own fault.

230
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,100
Since the Emperor wants to treat her, just let it be.

231
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Just let it be.

232
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
- Go knock on the door.<br>- Yes.

233
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,000
Young Master, Consort Qi is here. She wants to meet with you.

234
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,600
It's strange. Consort Qi isn't very close with us. Why would she come here?

235
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,400
I don't have time to meet with her. Go tell her that.

236
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,200
She won't be involved in what happened to Lady Fuca.

237
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,800
Regarding the bamboo matter, I won't blame her.

238
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,600
Ask her to behave herself.

239
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,600
Yes.

240
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
The way you're dealing with problems,

241
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:10,769
seems different from before.

242
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:12,591
Before, I was too kind.

243
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:14,346
Always being generous.

244
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,713
That makes them dare to bully me

245
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,600
when I'm having a difficult time.

246
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,300
Now that Lady Fuca has become insane,

247
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,700
this can be a warning to them,

248
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,100
that they can't bully me.

249
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,200
But you still forgave Consort Qi.

250
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,800
She is as cruel as she is loving towards her son.

251
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,300
Lady Fuca has become insane.

252
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,500
I shouldn't force her anymore.

253
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,400
I just need to give her a warning.

254
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,000
Everyone says that Consort Nian is aggressive and ruthless.

255
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,800
People are afraid of her iron fist.

256
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,700
Those characteristics are effective when dealing with

257
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,900
people with certain agendas.

258
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,411
That's why Consort Nian has been pampered all these years. It is not without its reasons.

259
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,100
I should learn something from this method used by Consort Nian.

260
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,172
Before I was always bullied by others.

261
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,100
It's time for that to change.

262
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,449
These lucky bags made by Sister are small.

263
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,600
Grab them on New Year's eve.

264
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,900
If you can catch many of them by one hand,

265
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,856
you will have good luck in the New Year.

266
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,500
I don't know anything about that.

267
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,900
Are you praising my lucky bags, or teasing me about my big hands?

268
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,500
I'm just praising you. You think too much.

269
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't want to praise you anymore.

270
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,400
Consort, there is your yarn.

271
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,500
Aunt Jin-Xi.

272
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,100
Prince Dun beat Zhang-Lin.

273
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,400
What?

274
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,000
What are you talking about?

275
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,000
Something has happened.

276
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,400
What happened?

277
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,600
Prince Dun came back to the capital three days ago.

278
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,400
He was late for the morning assembly, and arrived at the hall in a military uniform.

279
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:08,253
The morning hall is not a battlefield.

280
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,800
Also, he came back without a victory.

281
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,200
But arriving late and wearing a military uniform,

282
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,800
wasn't it to swagger around?

283
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,500
Before His Majesty could say anything,

284
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,000
Zhang Lin, the censor, reprimanded him, and rebuked him for his impoliteness.

285
00:17:19,276 --> 00:17:21,267
Prince Dun is always reckless.

286
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,800
He has always despised the civil officers and scholars.

287
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,200
A censor always gives advice to the Emperor,

288
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,900
and points out the wrong-doings of officers.

289
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,700
Only they would dare to accuse Prince Dun without mercy.

290
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,900
Yes, you're right. Prince Dun didn't do anything then.

291
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,800
But on the way back,

292
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,200
he stopped Zhang-Lin, and punched and knocked him out.

293
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,312
What?

294
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,700
Yes, the ancient laws say no one can beat up a censor.

295
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,900
Moreover, it was his fault from the beginning.

296
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,300
This time Prince Dun has made everyone angry.

297
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,000
All the censors are calling for him to be punished severely,

298
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,800
per the laws of the Imperial Court.

299
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,500
But Prince Dun does not admit any fault.

300
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,100
He hasn't been to assembly for two days, saying he is sick.

301
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,600
This is ridiculous.

302
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,700
When His Majesty ascended the throne,

303
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,800
everyone knows how he dealt with 8th Prince and 7th Prince.

304
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,200
Prince Dun is being disrespectful.

305
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,800
I don't this this will be hard for His Majesty to settle.

306
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,800
If His Majesty is truly angry,

307
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
this is going to become complicated.

308
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,700
Prince Dun just made a contribution in the battlefield.

309
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,700
If His Majesty punishes him,

310
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,748
I'm afraid it will affect His Majesty's reputation.

311
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,900
If this doesn't settle out well,

312
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:30,373
it will harm the Imperial Court.

313
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,300
You're right.

314
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,600
Because of this,

315
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,500
His Majesty is at the Hall of Mental Cultivation, and hasn't come out all day.

316
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,100
It's getting late. You should go check.

317
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,000
Let me think first.

318
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,145
Greetings, Your Majesty.

319
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,900
Wishes for Your Majesty's health and peace.

320
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,800
Stand.

321
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

322
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,300
You already heard

323
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,200
about what has happened in the palace these last few days?

324
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,500
Yes, this news has spread everywhere.

325
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,400
Even as a concubine, I have heard something of it.

326
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,900
Even though there are many matters of state,

327
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,300
Your Majesty, you must take care your health.

328
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,912
I stewed this donkey-hide gelatin with codonopsis.

329
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,600
It's good for Your Majesty, to regulate and reinforce qi.

330
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,000
You already know the details

331
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,774
regarding Prince Dun beating up the censor.

332
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,400
What do you think I should do?

333
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,700
Do I need to follow the laws and punish Prince Dun?

334
00:20:02,724 --> 00:20:04,618
Your Majesty is the Emperor.

335
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,100
Of course, Your Majesty needs to follow the laws.

336
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,400
But Your Majesty doesn't need to punish him.

337
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,500
I thought you would suggest punishing him.

338
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,600
Tell me what you think.

339
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,700
Your Majesty won't blame me, if I comment on matters of the state?

340
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,800
It's fine. This is just a normal conversation.

341
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,500
I won't blame you.

342
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,400
I think

343
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,200
the most important thing right now is to appease the people.

344
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,400
And solve the conflict between Prince Dun and the officers.

345
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,200
If there's a fight, one side will surely be harmed.

346
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,500
But both sides are important assets of the Qing Dynasty.

347
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,600
Prince Dun just made a contribution in the battlefield.

348
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,900
If Your Majesty punishes him at this time,

349
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,900
I'm afraid the other generals will become disgruntled.

350
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,700
Actually Your Majesty doesn't need to punish Prince Dun to settle this issue.

351
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
The officers are angry because

352
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,600
they want a settlement.

353
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,500
Your Majesty just needs to give them a statement.

354
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,000
The best way is ask Prince Dun to pay a visit and apologize.

355
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,200
Ask him to apologize?

356
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,400
He is so arrogant,

357
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,500
it'd be easier just to kill him.

358
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,200
Not really.

359
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,000
He fought for this country in wars.

360
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,000
He's a hero.

361
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
What is the most difficult obstacle for a hero?

362
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,000
It is a beauty.

363
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,000
You clever girl.

364
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,900
Only you can think of a trick like this.

365
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Your Majesty also knows that a beauty is the most difficult obstacle for a hero.

366
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,400
I don't know anything about big matters.

367
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,200
I only know this little trick.

368
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,700
Prince is most afraid of Princess.

369
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,300
If Princess helps with this, everything can be settled.

370
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,396
I've met the Princess several times.

371
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,400
She is not someone without understanding.

372
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,100
Who do you think should go, and ask for help from the Princess?

373
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,000
If Your Majesty doesn't mind,

374
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,300
I'd like to take care of this.

375
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,000
Among the concubines, you're the one who can help me solve problems.

376
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,032
All those officers who take a salary,

377
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,400
just make noise all day,

378
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,900
but can't decide whether to punish him or not.

379
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,900
They are all useless.

380
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,800
I am just one of your concubines.

381
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,600
This is not my idea.

382
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,700
It is from Your Majesty.

383
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,700
I just guessed correctly, with some luck.

384
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,600
The officers understand books and theories.

385
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,000
But I understand Your Majesty.

386
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,800
His Majesty's thoughts,

387
00:22:42,022 --> 00:22:44,034
I think I can guess at some of them.

388
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,900
Huan Huan, only you know what I'm thinking.

389
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,900
But look at the behavior of Prince Dun.

390
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,700
I can't let him keep doing this.

391
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,288
If Prince Dun continues to be domineering,

392
00:22:58,288 --> 00:23:00,034
Your Majesty will have this for later.

393
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,500
It is really good news for our people.

394
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,200
But now is not the time to eliminate Prince Dun.

395
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,000
That's right.

396
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,000
After all these things are settled,

397
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm going to let your father take charge of the Censorate.

398
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,500
He can help me impeach all the officers.

399
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,800
But your father alone will not be enough.

400
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:27,160
The talented officers, not associated with Prince Dun and Nian Gengyao,

401
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,400
I want to promote them all.

402
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,100
I don't want to act rashly, which will only alert the enemy,

403
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,200
so I'm hesitating.

404
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,400
To appease them...

405
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:45,200
Prince Dun and his princess already have a lot of wealth.

406
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,400
They are parents now.

407
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,200
It seems

408
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,100
we need to do something for their children.

409
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,400
They have a son and a daughter.

410
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,700
Their daughter is Princess of Qingcheng.

411
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:04,188
I plan to promote her as He Shuo Princess.

412
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,700
Her position is equal to the the daughter of a concubine.

413
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,900
Then I'll promote his son to Bei Zi, to follow in the footsteps of his father.

414
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,300
Your Majesty is considering everything.

415
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,000
But I think Your Majesty must do more than just promote Princess.

416
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,400
Her name must be changed as well.

417
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,900
The name should be Gong Ding.

418
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,400
This will remind her father to be respectful and peaceful.

419
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,900
To be sure,

420
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,500
Your Majesty wouldn't want to start a fight to solve a conflict between brothers.

421
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,200
It depends on Prince Dun,

422
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,000
whether he understands the effort of Your Majesty or not.

423
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,000
Moreover, Princess should stay in the palace,

424
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,900
and be cared for by the Empress.

425
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,500
Then if something were to happen in the future,

426
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,000
we could use the Princess to threaten Prince Dun.

427
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,700
That's right. Do it as you've said.

428
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,100
I will issue an Imperial edict later.

429
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,600
About what you just said.

430
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,000
A beauty is the most difficult obstacle for a hero?

431
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,500
Your Majesty likes to tease me.

432
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,300
I am not a beauty.

433
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
- Your Majesty.<br>- Yes.

434
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,700
Your Majesty asked Lady An to sleep with you tonight.

435
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Lady An sent people here to ask about it.

436
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,700
Tell her she doesn't need to come.

437
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,300
Take a rest.

438
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,600
Sister An felt patronized by Your Majesty recently.

439
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,700
Now would be the best time to pamper her.

440
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,700
Don't keep her waiting.

441
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,500
I will go now.

442
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,100
Don't go.

443
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,800
I think Sister An

444
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,500
is still waiting for Your Majesty.

445
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,000
Your Majesty must keep your promise,

446
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,700
and not break it for a girl.

447
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,800
But I want you to be by my side.

448
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,179
I just want Your Majesty to keep me in your heart.

449
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,200
I won't steal you away from Sister An.

450
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,000
Take care on your way back.

451
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,900
I will go.

452
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,900
Young Master, Master An is going that way.

453
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,073
Whoever she is,

454
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,800
the only thing that matters is whether I can catch the heart of His Majesty.

455
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,500
Jin-Xi.

456
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,900
You, Liu-Zhu and Huan-Bi.

457
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,600
Go make preparations for Prince Dun and Princess' arrival to the palace day after tomorrow.

458
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,600
Alright.

459
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,073
Greetings, Empress.

460
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,500
Stand.

461
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,600
Thank you, Empress.

462
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,600
Greetings, Consort Wan.

463
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,600
Give the seat, and serve the tea.

464
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,900
Yes.

465
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,000
Hui-Chun, serve the tea.

466
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,700
Consort Wan is recovered now.

467
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,000
I'm glad to see that.

468
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,600
A few months ago Princess came to the palace.

469
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,300
I wanted to talk with the Princess,

470
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
but unfortunately, I was busy at the time.

471
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,149
I regretted that.

472
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,300
Consort is precious. How dare I come and disturb Consort?

473
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,900
According to virtue, yes.

474
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,300
But from a family perspective, I should call Princess, Tenth Sister.

475
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,300
We're all family. We should be close to each other.

476
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,100
It is my pleasure to hear that from Consort.

477
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,600
Empress looks healthy recently.

478
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,400
Princess really has a way with words.

479
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,700
Princess looks better since giving birth to Xuan Hong Bei-Zi.

480
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,600
Bei-Zi? Empress must be joking.

481
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,200
Xuan Hong is only six years old. How can be become Bei-Zi?

482
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,800
That's the good will of His Majesty.

483
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,500
His Majesty likes Xuan Hong the most of all his nephews.

484
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,500
Although Xuan Hong is small, he is smart and cute.

485
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,200
So His Majesty wants to promote him as Bei-Zi, earlier than usual.

486
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,400
To educate him properly, so in the future, he can become like his father.

487
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,900
And pacify the nations, and contribute to our country.

488
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,100
On behalf of Xuan Hong, I thank His Majesty first.

489
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,700
That's not all.

490
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,700
His Majesty wants to add to the good news.

491
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,500
His Majesty wants to promote Princess of Qingcheng

492
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,600
as He Shuo Gong Ding Princess.

493
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,100
And after this, be taken care of by the Empress.

494
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,200
Thank you for His Majesty's kind intention.

495
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,000
But she is only twelve years old, and still innocent.

496
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,300
I'm afraid if Empress takes care of her,

497
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,900
there will be no peace for the Empress.

498
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,900
Would the Empress ask His Majesty to take back his will?

499
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,066
His Majesty doesn't have many children.

500
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,900
It's good news that His Majesty wants Princess to come to the palace.

501
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,500
Since the Dynasty was established,

502
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,600
although there was a daughter of a Prince promoted as He Shuo Princess,

503
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:48,300
it was because of a marriage situation that the Princess was promoted.

504
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,500
This promotion will be the first of its kind in history?

505
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,700
Alright. I'm a bit tired.

506
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,600
I'll be leaving first.

507
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,200
The Imperial edict will be sent to your house tonight.

508
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,900
Let me send Empress.

509
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,500
It's late. I'll go back first.

510
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,200
Consort Wan.

511
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,400
It's still early.

512
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,100
I would like to visit Consort's palace.

513
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,100
Would I be disturbing Consort?

514
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,000
Of course not.

515
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,400
I prefer you come without an invitation.

516
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,100
Otherwise, it would be as if we're strangers.

517
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,200
Please.

518
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,500
Please.

519
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,100
This tea is called Xue Ding Han Cui.

520
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:17,083
It was sent here from 500 miles away.

521
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,900
Give it a try. Do you like it?

522
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,700
Recently, Consort is the one who takes care of His Majesty the most.

523
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,900
Of course, Consort acquires the best of everything.

524
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,500
I was neglected when I had my miscarriage.

525
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,200
Only you came to visit me.

526
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,700
I have long kept this in my heart.

527
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And I hope there is a day, when I can repay that kindness.

528
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,800
Would Consort be willing to help me convince His Majesty?

529
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,700
If I think of it from your perspective,

530
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,100
I think it better for you to obey the Imperial edict.

531
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,800
To let the Empress take care of your daughter.

532
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,300
Why do you say so?

533
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,433
As a wife and mother,

534
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:07,400
you need to plan for your husband and children,

535
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,500
and put them first. Don't you agree?

536
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,900
A few days ago, the Prince beat the censor and made everyone angry.

537
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,800
We wish the Prince would pay a visit to Zhang Lin and apologize.

538
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,800
The Prince is a bad tempered person. Only others go to ask for his favour.

539
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,188
If you care about the Prince, you should give him your advice on this case.

540
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,300
Although his Majesty wants to protect the Prince,

541
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,800
it is he who beat others first.

542
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,400
And Zhang Lin is still lying in bed and still wont wake up.

543
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,529
His Majesty is upset also.

544
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,500
And the Prince is very straight-forward, so it's easy for him to make enemies.

545
00:32:47,568 --> 00:32:51,589
If your daughter is there, she can always give some advice to His Majesty.

546
00:32:52,298 --> 00:32:53,518
Isn't it better?

547
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,500
I will tell His Majesty that so you can always go into the palace to visit your daughter.

548
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,200
This is good.

549
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,600
Since His Majesty puts in a lot of effort, the Prince adn I should take this without any choice.

550
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,800
Thank you Consort.

551
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:16,813
Have a drink.

552
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:25,883
I finally now what wistfully is called.

553
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,700
Don't say that..

554
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,600
I don't know,,,, if I look like this

555
00:33:34,617 --> 00:33:36,638
...will His Majesty come?

556
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,081
Don't worry.

557
00:33:39,135 --> 00:33:43,838
General Nian already sent someone to come pass a message that they know Consort is being neglected.

558
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,200
He will cooperate with Prince Dun to probe the intentions of His Majesty.

559
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,900
I told you don't tell my brother about the things between His Majesty and I.

560
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,600
Don't tell brother about the things between His majesty and I

561
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,100
Neither of us mention it, because everyone already knows.

562
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:58,568
His Majesty neglects you, Consort.

563
00:33:58,568 --> 00:34:01,329
We can't hide it from General Nian

564
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:04,010
We cant hide it from General Nian.

565
00:34:06,136 --> 00:34:07,736
Anyway. why bother dealing with Prince Dun again.

566
00:34:08,476 --> 00:34:11,576
Even if Prince Dun helped him before..

567
00:34:11,576 --> 00:34:13,056
It's not good for him to be close to Prince Dun.

568
00:34:15,436 --> 00:34:16,836
Now the daugther of Prince Dun became He Shou Princess <br>and his son becomes Bei Zi too

569
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:21,676
He is very Happy<br>

570
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:22,839
It's normal for General

571
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:24,739
to hang out with Prince Dun

572
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:26,039
Prince Dun is reckless

573
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,399
And too rebellious

574
00:34:29,138 --> 00:34:31,639
tell Consort not to worry<br>

575
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,079
When he gets one thing from Prince Dun

576
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:37,429
Then the Prince will help.

577
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:40,518
Consort to get the heart and mind from His majesty again

578
00:34:40,518 --> 00:34:42,599
Really?

579
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,318
General and prince Dun are always there

580
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:45,798
Nothing to be afraid of

581
00:34:45,798 --> 00:34:48,378
<br>I wish so

582
00:34:49,518 --> 00:34:51,658
<br>

583
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:54,018
Song Zhi

584
00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:55,059
Hurry

585
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,159
and light up the Huan Yi perfume.

586
00:34:58,018 --> 00:34:59,519
It will make me feel better.

587
00:35:00,627 --> 00:35:04,307
Yes<br> His majesty has arrived.

588
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:06,515
Greetings. <br> At ease.

589
00:35:06,515 --> 00:35:09,135
<br>

590
00:35:09,135 --> 00:35:10,519
<br>

591
00:35:10,935 --> 00:35:12,335
<br>

592
00:35:12,707 --> 00:35:16,614
Prince Dun personally visited Zhang Lin to apologize yesterday.

593
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,838
Although he was not sincere,

594
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:23,441
at least it has been settled. Huan-Huan,

595
00:35:24,044 --> 00:35:27,335
you really helped me alot <br> Its my duty

596
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:29,654
to help his majesty share his burdens.

597
00:35:32,352 --> 00:35:33,513
There's nothing much that I can help in terms of state matters.

598
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:39,782
<br>

599
00:35:40,944 --> 00:35:42,732
<br>

600
00:35:44,085 --> 00:35:46,302
Xuan Ding Han Cui is needed good tea.

601
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:51,156
I know you like it, so I sent you the best. Do you like it?

602
00:35:52,211 --> 00:35:54,002
Of course I do.<br> Before this, I made this tea for Prince Dun.

603
00:35:54,965 --> 00:35:56,090
I made it for Princess too.

604
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,908
But Princess seems to have gotten used to drinking this kind of tea.

605
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:01,175
I thought

606
00:36:01,175 --> 00:36:03,056
the tea was not familar to her.

607
00:36:03,056 --> 00:36:05,179
Luckily, she didn't mind.

608
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:07,110
For the tributes,

609
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,703
if the palace has it, General Nian

610
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:12,439
would have it too, or even a better one.

611
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,065
Even Prince Dun has it now.

612
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:16,990
I never did give it to him

613
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:19,196
Where did he get it from?

614
00:36:20,459 --> 00:36:21,282
<br>

615
00:36:21,282 --> 00:36:23,357
Don't be angry.

616
00:36:23,357 --> 00:36:25,129
The incident of Prince Dun's violence

617
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:28,914
was a great disturbance. If any rumors surface

618
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,858
after it has settled, then his contributions will be eliminated.

619
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:34,329
Don't you think so?

620
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:35,764
<br>

621
00:36:35,764 --> 00:36:37,196
<br>

622
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:39,362
<br>

623
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:41,320
<br>

624
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,150
Have some water, your majesty.

625
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,319
<br>

626
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:49,620
<br>

627
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,907
<br>

628
00:36:52,907 --> 00:36:54,843
<br>

629
00:36:54,843 --> 00:36:57,450
Your majesty,

630
00:36:58,766 --> 00:36:59,772
I've just sewed a new sachet and would like to give

631
00:36:59,772 --> 00:37:01,525
it to you. <br>Would you like to take a look

632
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:03,140
and see if you like it?

633
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:06,325
Huan-Huan just gave me a sachet a few days ago.

634
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,530
I already have it with me.

635
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,430
Adding another one would be a burden.

636
00:37:14,472 --> 00:37:16,973
My sewing skills are no better than sister's.

637
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:19,444
No

638
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:21,558
Sister's sewing skills far surpasses mine.

639
00:37:21,558 --> 00:37:23,678
Look at those

640
00:37:29,796 --> 00:37:32,011
sachets and other things. It shows how great sister's skills are.

641
00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:33,832
Its because his majesty doesn't mind.

642
00:37:34,368 --> 00:37:35,987
<br>

643
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,366
<br>

644
00:37:39,203 --> 00:37:42,082
This is good too. I like it too.

645
00:37:43,185 --> 00:37:45,536
Give it to Fang-nuo and put in my bed room.

646
00:37:47,863 --> 00:37:50,598
I am satisfied.

647
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,190
<br>

648
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,306
The sachet made by sister,

649
00:37:57,216 --> 00:37:59,955
mine is not as good.

650
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:02,310
Please

651
00:38:03,216 --> 00:38:04,708
forgive me , your majesty.

652
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:07,984
No its not.

653
00:38:07,984 --> 00:38:09,232
I understand your sincerity.

654
00:38:10,245 --> 00:38:11,711
There is nothing to blame you for.

655
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:13,406
<br>

656
00:38:14,023 --> 00:38:16,418
Sister's sewing skills

657
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:18,949
are improving.

658
00:38:19,747 --> 00:38:25,619
It would be great to sew a pair of mandarin ducks on a sachet to express her love for his majesty.

659
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:32,088
Maybe his majesty will like it. <br> Mandarin ducks are nice too. But its not good if his majesty wears it

660
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:35,877
around everywhere. Its better to sew a dragon.

661
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:41,097
About the mandarin ducks, if your majesty likes it,

662
00:38:41,145 --> 00:38:43,432
I can make another one

663
00:38:43,432 --> 00:38:45,646
and put it under the pillow, ok?

664
00:38:45,678 --> 00:38:47,904
What are you writing?

665
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:51,478
It sounds good, but sad.

666
00:38:51,525 --> 00:38:54,618
<br>

667
00:38:54,618 --> 00:38:58,231
Holding onto each other hands with teary eyes,

668
00:38:58,278 --> 00:39:01,023
yet no words could express their feelings. Its not appropriate for the current situation.

669
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:29,815
Flower blooms and the moon shines brightly in the night sky, may couples stay in love forever.

670
00:39:29,815 --> 00:39:31,548
Take it and hang it in front of your bed.

671
00:39:31,548 --> 00:39:34,365
Thank you, your majesty.

672
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:38,036
Your majesty and sister are so loving. What a great sight to see.

673
00:39:38,078 --> 00:39:40,414
Sister is blessed,,

674
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:44,491
no one else could have asked for more. <br> Your majesty, you better console Sister An.

675
00:39:44,555 --> 00:39:49,497
She's feeling jealous.<br> You're teasing me again, sister.

676
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:55,748
How can I be jealous of sister and your majesty?<br>Rong-er has a modest nature,

677
00:39:55,748 --> 00:39:58,280
even if she's jealous, it will only be for a month.
