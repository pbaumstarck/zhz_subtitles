1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,900
Episode 36

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,000
To the right.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,400
There, go, go.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,800
Left, more left, a bit more.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,800
- Like this?<br>- Good, just like that.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,100
This picture is perfect for our house.

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,200
There's no better place for it than here.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,600
It's good that His Majesty writes,

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,500
but he keeps writing.

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,300
My neck really hurts.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,200
Greetings, Lady Wan.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,800
Why are you so hurried?

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,400
I was asked to invite you to the Hall of Mental Cultivation.

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,500
What happened?

15
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,300
His Majesty is very upset.

16
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,000
Huan-Bi, prepare to depart.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,300
Down.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,900
Consort has arrived.

19
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,700
His Majesty is very angry.

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,300
He chased all the servants away.

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,000
Consort, I beg of you,

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,700
please try to calm him down.

23
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,500
- We'd be so grateful.<br>- What happened?

24
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,600
I believe it has something to do with a letter from Lord Dun.

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,000
Do you know what he wrote?

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,700
Seems to be about a request for a promotion.

27
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,700
Lord Dun is too greedy.

28
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,400
Two of his children already received promotions. Now he's asking for another?

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,500
Servant has the same thoughts.

30
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,300
His Majesty could deny the request.

31
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,000
He's not a hot-tempered person.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,200
That's true.

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,300
Nonsense.

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,000
Consort.

35
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,100
Your Majesty, drink some tea. It will help you to calm down.

36
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,500
Why aren't you asking why I'm so upset?

37
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,200
I'm waiting for Your Majesty to calm down.

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,900
You will tell me when you want to.

39
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,500
See for yourself.

40
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,800
Yun, how dare he...

41
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,400
He wants Your Majesty to give his mother a title

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,100
of Honored Consort,

43
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,300
and receive a burial in the Imperial grave.

44
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,800
Lady Wen is former Lady.

45
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,900
Even though she has passed away,

46
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,500
giving her a title isn't a problem.

47
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,200
But because she died discontented,

48
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,700
the former Emperor denied her being buried there.

49
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,100
If you agree with the promotion,

50
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,100
you will be negating the former Emperor's decision.

51
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,000
What does Your Majesty plan to do?

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,600
He wants to destroy me,

53
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,000
even put the former Emperor aside.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Worse than than,

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
after Lord Dun asked for this promotion,

56
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,300
Nian Gengyao asked for the title of Honored Consort,

57
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,300
and to rebuild the Imperial grave just to calm the Ladies.

58
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,500
Your Majesty is implying

59
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,000
that Lord Dun and Nian Gengyao are conspiring together.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,400
Nonsense.

61
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,300
Your Majesty, calm down.

62
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,700
Don't be angry because of them.

63
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,100
It's a waste to be angry because of them.

64
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,300
There are some things I can tolerate, but some things I can't.

65
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,300
Even if I can't be loyal to my parent,

66
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,200
I can tolerate what they have done,

67
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,500
but Empress can't.

68
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,700
The title of Honored Consort is too much.

69
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,200
Even the mother of the Lord,

70
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
did not have the title of Honored Consort.

71
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,900
So how can a woman who betrayed the former Emperor receive it?

72
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,300
If you agree with this promotion,

73
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,100
I'm sure all the Lords and Consorts will be against it.

74
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,800
Both sides will be affected.

75
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,000
If I agree, I lose on both sides.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,300
If I reject it, he will feel a grudge against me.

77
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,500
All this effort will be for nothing.

78
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Your Majesty has been generous for so many years.

79
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Do you wish to continue?

80
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,100
General Nian has many allies.

81
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,700
If I don't tolerate,

82
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,600
I'll only have 40% support.

83
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,300
Nian Gengyao hates the way I treat Consort Nian.

84
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,700
He kept trying to get close to Lord Dun,

85
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,800
in order to gain a win-win situation,

86
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,800
to join forces against me.

87
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,700
Staying in the palace,

88
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,500
seeing the things that bother your Majesty,

89
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,400
I wouldn't dare to touch.

90
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,500
I only knew of my own happiness of being with your Majesty.

91
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,600
I never knew you had so many worries.

92
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,700
Every position

93
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,300
has difficulties that cannot be avoided.

94
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,200
They must run their course.

95
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,100
Then, for the future,

96
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,300
your Majesty must accept this one.

97
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,400
I'm such a coward of an Emperor.

98
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,900
Emperor Jing of Han wanted to calm the seven countries,

99
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
so he killed Chao Cuo.

100
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,400
Emperor Guangwu Liu-Xiu wanted to rebuild the Hans,

101
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,400
so he killed his brother, even though he was scared.

102
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
In order to stabilize the government,

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,700
he withheld the title of Empress from his beloved wife, Yin Lihua.

104
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,600
She was only called Lady.

105
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,800
But in the end,

106
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,300
the country was made harmonious and prosperous.

107
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,100
A true man is broad-minded.

108
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,900
Your Majesty needs to be patient,

109
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,900
so you can setup a greater plan for your government.

110
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,500
Not as a coward, not selfishly.

111
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,300
Huan-Huan.

112
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,300
You really know how to calm my nerves.

113
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,700
It's not to calm you, Your Majesty.

114
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm just reciting the facts.

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You're right.

116
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I need to be patient.

117
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,500
But how exactly?

118
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,900
Grant Lord Dun his request,

119
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,300
about the title of Honored Consort.

120
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,200
If even Lady Wan cannot advise His Majesty...

121
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,700
What should we do?

122
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,100
How am I to know,

123
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,700
if even Lady Wan does not know?

124
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,300
Your Majesty.

125
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,800
It's fine. Clean it up later.

126
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,700
Your Majesty, please.

127
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Agree to the promotion,

128
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,600
and bestow the title.

129
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,300
Then move her burial to the imperial grave.

130
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,800
Then, for all the Consorts,

131
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,700
elevate each of their titles.

132
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Especially to the consort lead, Honored Consort Sou-Qi.

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,800
And give the former Empress a higher title,

134
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,000
to show Your Majesty's loyalty.

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,600
That's right. He wants his mother to have the title.

136
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,400
I'll give all the consorts a title,

137
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,200
as a prayer to the former Empress.

138
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,800
That way, none of them will be able to complain.

139
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
This shouldn't cause any complaints from the minister.

140
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,700
And the Lords and Consorts will all be glad to hear this news.

141
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,900
But Lord Guo's mother...

142
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,500
Empress Su has already left.

143
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,200
What will Your Majesty do about this?

144
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,600
Lord Seventeenth wouldn't care.

145
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,800
He may not care,

146
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,300
but I'm afraid others will think that

147
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,100
Your Majesty is looking down on him.

148
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,500
Why not extend him a favor?

149
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,700
Why not?

150
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,900
Empress Su is a monk.

151
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,700
I cannot give her a title,

152
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:38,100
but I can greet her as Lady Chong-Jing.

153
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,100
Yes, that would be the best solution.

154
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,600
You are my solution,

155
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,900
thinking on my behalf.

156
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,000
Your Majesty needs to the rule the country.

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,800
I don't know anything about that.

158
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,400
I can only take on small matters,

159
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,800
for Your Majesty.

160
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,300
A thousand mile trip starts with the first step.

161
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:05,300
Those small matters can lead to solving bigger matters.

162
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,500
Empress has arrived.

163
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,800
Greetings, Empress.

164
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
I heard that His Majesty is upset,

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,400
so I've come to help.

166
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,700
Yes, that's true.

167
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,600
But right now Lady Wan is in the palace.

168
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,500
Eunuch Su, please inform His Majesty

169
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,300
that I am here.

170
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,200
Yes, Empress.

171
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,200
Empress, it's better to not meet His Majesty right now.

172
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Since Lady Wan is here,

173
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,000
His Majesty has no need of me.

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,600
Let's visit Empress Dowager.

175
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,700
I wish for Your Majesty to show generosity,

176
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,800
and return the title of Honored Consort to Consort Nian.

177
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,200
If I return her title, I'll feel guilty towards you.

178
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,100
How will I stop the rumors?

179
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Both brother and sister are alike.

180
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,400
Once they are content, they will make a mistake.

181
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
And when she receives the title,

182
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,100
the Nian family will settle down.

183
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,200
Your Majesty must tolerate for the sake of the country.

184
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,400
And I will tolerate for Your Majesty's sake.

185
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,300
This is very unfair for you.

186
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
I don't think so.

187
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,000
As long as it helps Your Majesty,

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,800
I can be patient with Consort Nian.

189
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,100
Okay.

190
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,200
Huan-Huan, we lost a child.

191
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,600
I'm sorry.

192
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,600
But don't worry,

193
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll make up for that.

194
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,600
Lord Dun wants to give Wen-Xi the title of Honored Consort.

195
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
And Nian Gengyao supports this idea.

196
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,100
Time flies.

197
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,600
No matter how big the title is,

198
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,800
the dead will never know about it.

199
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Mother, allow this promotion.

200
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Why wouldn't I?

201
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,700
This is just to show the people.

202
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,600
The dead will never know.

203
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,100
As long as your decision is good for the country,

204
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,900
I don't care about the title.

205
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,000
Thank you, Mother.

206
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,900
Time passes and things change.

207
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,800
Look at Consort Nian.

208
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,700
I'm afraid she will become like Wen-Xi.

209
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,900
Thank goodness she doesn't have any children.

210
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,400
Because of this, I have given more care to Lady Wan.

211
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,800
She lost a child.

212
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,000
I feel as if I owe her something.

213
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,400
I know what you are thinking.

214
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,600
The Huanyi perfume we gave to Consort Nian,

215
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,700
it contained muck.

216
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,200
It spoiled Consort Nian.

217
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,600
But I never thought it would affect Lady Wan.

218
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,400
We never wanted that.

219
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,300
But since it happened, don't think too much about it.

220
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,800
You can love Lady Wan more. Everything will be fine.

221
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,000
Just not too much.

222
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,700
I'm not a good father.

223
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,000
You must make decisions when necessary.

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,800
Once Consort Nian has a child,

225
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,100
I'm sure Nian Gengyao

226
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,600
will try to make him Emperor.

227
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,400
When that day comes,

228
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,300
you and I

229
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,000
will lose our positions.

230
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:12,100
You have set Consort Nian aside.

231
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,200
No matter how educated Lord Dun is,

232
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,700
he still cannot compare to General Nian.

233
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,500
But what if they were to work together?

234
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,900
Therefore,

235
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:29,000
you should spend more time with Consort Nian.

236
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,400
It's not that I don't want to,

237
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,700
to calm her down.

238
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,000
Since she served you for so long,

239
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,300
and so faithfully.

240
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm an Emperor, also a father.

241
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,500
When Consort Nian was pregnant,

242
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,600
you were forced to kill the child.

243
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,400
How could this not hurt you?

244
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,600
These things were done by Consort Duan.

245
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,200
Consort Duan admitted to it,

246
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,600
so don't think about it anymore.

247
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,100
So many children lost.

248
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,800
All this might be returned to me.

249
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm the one who prepared

250
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,800
the medicine for Consort Nian.

251
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,800
If someone's to pay, it shouldn't be you.

252
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,000
Every time His Majesty has gotten angry.

253
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,700
I've been by his side.

254
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,800
And this is only the first time for Lady Wan.

255
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Empress knows that

256
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,200
she is sure to advise His Majesty.

257
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,500
Empress.

258
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,500
Lady Wan will start going to

259
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,900
the Hall of Mental Cultivation.

260
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,400
But Consorts shouldn't involve themselves in ruling.

261
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,200
Lady Wan should avoid it.

262
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,900
Nothing will happen to her,

263
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,000
if that's what His Majesty wants.

264
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,800
Your servant doesn't think so.

265
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,300
It all depends on His Majesty's mood.

266
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,900
That's true.

267
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,400
If His Majesty is happy, he'll allow her to talk.

268
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,800
If he is not, she'll be overstepping her bounds.

269
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,300
Empress.

270
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,400
His Majesty is moving to the Palace of Supporting Earth.

271
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,600
I knew it. This day has finally come.

272
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,600
Madam.

273
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Madam.

274
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,100
Madam, His Majesty is coming to the Palace of Supporting Earth.

275
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,900
Madam, quick, greet His Majesty.

276
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,400
Stand.

277
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

278
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,700
I'm here. Are you unhappy?

279
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm happy.

280
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,300
It's been a long time.

281
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,700
I thought

282
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,000
Your Majesty would never come.

283
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,700
I was so mad at you

284
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,800
that I did not want to see you.

285
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,800
But tomorrow,

286
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,000
I remembered that tomorrow

287
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,700
is the day you came to the palace.

288
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,200
Your Majesty.

289
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,100
Huan-Bi, listen -- the snow is melting.

290
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,700
Yes it is, Lady's hearing is good.

291
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Spring is here.

292
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,300
All the snow will melt.

293
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,200
His Majesty went to the Palace of Supporting Earth. Are you not angry?

294
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,600
I'm aware now that

295
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,500
being the Emperor is difficult and complicated.

296
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,600
Since we each have our own difficulties,

297
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,800
we will end up troubling each other.

298
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,600
I'm just afraid that once His Majesty meets with Consort Nian

299
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,100
she will become your enemy again.

300
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,400
If she becomes my enemy,

301
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,300
then yes, I'll have no choice.

302
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,900
But if His Majesty and I are together,

303
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,400
my enemy will become the Emperor's enemy.

304
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,100
Empress, please have some tea.

305
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,000
Did you sleep well last night?

306
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,500
Yes, I'm fine.

307
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,000
I heard the snow melting last night,

308
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,400
dropping all night.

309
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,100
Empress didn't sleep well.

310
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,200
I'm afraid that all the consorts did not sleep well.

311
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,900
Consort Nian has arrived.

312
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,000
Greetings Empress.

313
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
Please, sit down.

314
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,300
Greetings Consort Nian.

315
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,600
Stand.

316
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,200
Thank you Consort.

317
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,100
Lady Wan, long time no see.

318
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,600
I think so.

319
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,500
But I'm always thinking of you.

320
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,400
Even though it's been a long time,

321
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,900
it seems just like the opposite.

322
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,900
I met with His Majesty yesterday.

323
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,800
His Majesty seemed to miss you very much.

324
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,100
You really know His Majesty well.

325
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,600
You can read everything.

326
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,000
I dare not.

327
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,700
But everyone knows that

328
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,000
His Majesty misses Consort.

329
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,100
Thanks to you.

330
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Consort Nian, His Majesty chose some imported items and had them sent to your palace.

331
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,600
Are they to your liking?

332
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,700
Yes, as long as they were chosen by His Majesty.

333
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,000
It's good that you like them.

334
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,700
It's been so long since I've seen you, you've become a stranger.

335
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,900
Please visit me more often.

336
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,600
Yes, I will.

337
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,800
As long as you don't think of me as a meddler.

338
00:18:42,158 --> 00:18:45,036
Emperor has arrived.

339
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,900
Your Majesty.

340
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,000
Your Majesty visits so often,

341
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
aren't you getting tired of the dishes?

342
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,100
You've never asked that before.

343
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,700
I'm afraid...

344
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,700
Then I'll leave, so you won't have to ask.

345
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,800
Your Majesty.

346
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,900
You're thinking rubbish.

347
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,600
Tell me what you have prepared.

348
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,000
You'll know once you see it.

349
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,900
Zhen Yuan-Dao greets His Majesty.

350
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,100
Zhen Yuan-Dao, stand.

351
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

352
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,000
Outsides these walls, you're my minister,

353
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,400
but here, you're my father-in law.

354
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,600
So there's no need to be so formal.

355
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,700
Su Pei-Seng, prepare a seat.

356
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,400
Zhen, please sit.

357
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,900
Thank you, Eunuch.

358
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,200
May I ask why Your Majesty

359
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,800
has called for me?

360
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,500
I promoted you as Left Deputy Censor.

361
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,600
Are you getting used to the work?

362
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,900
Thank you, Your Majesty, for caring.

363
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,600
Sit down. I'll feel strange if you keep standing.

364
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,800
I wasn't so polite with Lady Wan.

365
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Lady Wan is a mischievous and playful girl,

366
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,500
because she is young.

367
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,000
I hope Your Majesty does not mind that.

368
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,800
I like her the way she is.

369
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,500
Thank you for Your Majesty's kindness.

370
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,800
Such a lucky star to my family,

371
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,000
and to Lady Wan.

372
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,700
I called you here

373
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,200
to tell you to keep in contact with useful people in the Censorate,

374
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,000
and to find out what's happening at the Censorate.

375
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,300
Your Majesty.

376
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,700
I will follow your order.

377
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,600
In the Censorate, Left Deputy Censor, Lady Guwalgiya E-Min,

378
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Lady Xue Chong-Jian, Lady Luo Ping, and I

379
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,100
have gathered evidence that proves the disloyalty of Nian Gengyao.

380
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,400
But without Your Majesty's command,

381
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,100
we dared not make a move.

382
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,800
Since Nian Gengyao's return,

383
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,500
complaints keep coming in.

384
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,600
I didn't look into it before,

385
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,200
because I didn't have a suitable plan

386
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,000
to gain success with one strike.

387
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,300
I understand what Your Majesty means.

388
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,800
I will do whatever Your Majesty requires.

389
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,400
Good.

390
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,400
When the time comes, I'll tell Zhang Ting-Yu to inform you.

391
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,000
I'll do whatever I can.

392
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,700
Oh.

393
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,400
Lady Wan is in the palace. Since you are here,

394
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,200
why not pay her a visit?

395
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

396
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,700
Since Lady Wan miscarried

397
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,600
my wife and I have been so worried.

398
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,600
We cannot come and go as we please to the palace.

399
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,800
We will wait for Your Majesty's call,

400
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,400
and then come and visit Lady Wan.

401
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,600
Don't worry. I'll take good care of Lady Wan.

402
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:22,000
Lady Wan and I, thank Your Majesty for taking care of us.

403
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,600
It's late.

404
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,200
I'll let you go home now.

405
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Su Pei-Seng, escort him.

406
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

407
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,700
Your Majesty, I'll take my leave of you now.

408
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,500
Consort.

409
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,300
What happened?

410
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,100
His Majesty is good to Consort these days.

411
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,400
All the servants are happy about it.

412
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,600
By the old rules,

413
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,000
there must be many people waiting to meet you, and give you gifts.

414
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,200
Times are different now.

415
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,800
It's not easy for me to gain His Majesty's love.

416
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,600
So, don't be careless.

417
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,800
But His Majesty still shows Consort favor.

418
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
I can't tell what is different,

419
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,300
but His Majesty does not treat me the way he did in the past.

420
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,800
Even though His Majesty visits here often,

421
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,000
he hasn't returned either my title

422
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
or my status to me.

423
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,700
I still feel unstable.

424
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,800
As long as His Majesty continues to come here, all those things will soon be yours.

425
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,800
I heard that His Majesty rewarded the General again.

426
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,700
That's good for him.

427
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,400
Even though I behave badly,

428
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
I'm still better than Brother.

429
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,400
What I'm most afraid of is, once Brother becomes too happy, he might cause trouble carelessly.

430
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,000
But since Brother is trustworthy,

431
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I, also, can settle down here.

432
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,600
Go and check whether the medicine is ready.

433
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,300
Then send it to His Majesty.

434
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,500
Yes, Consort.

435
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,600
You really have good technique.

436
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,200
I served my mom like this when I was at home.

437
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,900
You're a dutiful daughter.

438
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,600
I have this body because of my parents,

439
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,700
so I should be a dutiful daughter.

440
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,400
I wish to know,

441
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,200
why you treat me so well.

442
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Empress Dowager is the mother of His Majesty.

443
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,400
Therefore, also my mother-in-law.

444
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,200
My owner.

445
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,300
So, I should treat you nicely.

446
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,100
You are so loyal to me.

447
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,200
But you should spend more time with His Majesty.

448
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,400
You are young, but you are always by my side.

449
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,800
You need to plan for yourself.

450
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,300
Your make it sound like I do it on purpose.

451
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,400
It's not that I don't want to get close to His Majesty.

452
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,000
It's just that,

453
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,200
His Majesty cares about Empress Dowager's health.

454
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,300
So I should serve and take care of you.

455
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,600
Secondly, His Majesty has many wives.

456
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm not very good with makeup.

457
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,700
I can't compare to you.

458
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,300
I hope that when Empress Dowager has time, you will give me a lesson.

459
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,800
I've gained so much from Empress Dowager,

460
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,200
it's hard for me to leave.

461
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,000
You've become very good with words.

462
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,400
I have you by my side,

463
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,600
and the skill of Imperial Doctor Wen.

464
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,400
I'm sure to stay healthy.

465
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,500
This is all because of Imperial Doctor Wen.

466
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,000
I just stay by your side.

467
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,800
I cannot really help very much.

468
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,500
I know Empress didn't use perfume,

469
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,800
but I don't understand why.

470
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,900
Who doesn't like perfume?

471
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,500
But I wished to follow His Majesty's will.

472
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,200
It was to save money.

473
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,800
But no matter how I save,

474
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,200
once the others saw the precious perfume used by Consort Nian,

475
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,200
they complained about it, and said I was being stingy.

476
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,900
So that resulted with me not using perfume.

477
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,300
Empress is very kind.

478
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,700
His Majesty must appreciate your view.

479
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,500
It is just a small matter.

480
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,900
Greetings Empress.

481
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,300
Greetings Lady Wan.

482
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,900
Stand.

483
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,700
His Majesty has declared to all the consorts,

484
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,000
that the title of Noble Consort has been restored to Consort Nian.

485
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,700
I'm already aware of that. You may leave.

486
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,900
Look, it's just a change.

487
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,500
Empress doesn't feel weird about it?

488
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,600
Things like this can happen anytime.

489
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,700
Just like a flower that blooms in spring,

490
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,900
but only shows for a short time,

491
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,300
turns out to be meaningless.

492
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,600
Congratulations Consort! Congratulations Consort!

493
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,800
Stand.

494
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,100
I've waited so long for this. Finally it is here.

495
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,700
Consort missed His Majesty so much.

496
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,900
Now the world will know that His Majesty sensed it,

497
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,100
and treat Consort nicely now.

498
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,700
I'll never know the truth.

499
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
But might I dare to ask

500
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,300
does His Majesty treats you nicely again?

501
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Yes.

502
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,500
Consort kept up with the proposals.

503
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,900
Not just His Majesty,

504
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,400
but also I was touched by that.

505
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,600
Consort is loyal to His Majesty.

506
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,100
I'm sure His Majesty knows this.

507
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,500
There were so many rumors at that time. So in order to stop the rumors,

508
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
His Majesty had to avoid Consort.

509
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,700
Consort has finally gained success.

510
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,100
I'm not sure why,

511
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
but I feel a bit at a loss.

512
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,800
I've been with His Majesty for so many years,

513
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,400
but feel like I don't really know him.

514
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,300
I don't understand.

515
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,100
His Majesty treats you so well.

516
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,300
Clearly this shows that.

517
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
Keep safe the Imperial edict.

518
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,000
I don't care about the title,

519
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,000
as long as His Majesty keeps me in his mind.

520
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,500
This is the new tea for the year.

521
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Sister, what do you think?

522
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,500
It has a nice flavor. Thank you for thinking of me.

523
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,400
Sister seldom walks in front of His Majesty.

524
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,900
Therefore, I miss Sister, and have come to visit.

525
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,700
Sleepy in spring, and lazy in autumn. I don't really like celebrations.

526
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,700
I heard that Empress Dowager likes Sister very much.

527
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,900
Isn't it hard for you, to always be by her side?

528
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,100
No, as long as she doesn't complain about me.

529
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,500
Sister has the Empress Dowager's support,

530
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
so you should have nothing to worry about.

531
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,200
Unlike me, who is always facing trouble.

532
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,000
It could be

533
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,000
that His Majesty will plan for you.

534
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,600
But His Majesty restored the title to Consort Hua.

535
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,100
When I think about the way Consort Hua intimidated everybody,

536
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
I'm so scared I can't sleep.

537
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
The return of Consort Hua.

538
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,300
Sadly, it appears that His Majesty has forgotten all about

539
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,900
the miscarriage of Huan.

540
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,300
All her effort gone, just like that.

541
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,200
I would not dare to talk in front of His Majesty,

542
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,200
but Sister is different.

543
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,300
As long as you gain His Majesty's love,

544
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,900
His Majesty will love to hear what you have to say.

545
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,400
Is Sister angry with me?

546
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,600
Honored Lady Hui has misunderstood.

547
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,800
Lady did not advise His Majesty.

548
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,200
It was Lady Wan who asked His Majesty to restore Consort Hua's title.

549
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,900
What is this rubbish?

550
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,300
Servant wouldn't dare. I heard it from Xiao Sha-Zi.

551
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,400
- Are you sure there was no mistake?<br>- Xiao Sha-Zi works at the palace.

552
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,600
It wouldn't be a mistake.

553
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,700
Sister, why would Sister Huan do that?

554
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,700
Rumors cannot be trusted.

555
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,600
Huan hates Consort Hua. She wouldn't do that.

556
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,400
But last time, Sister Huan advised His Majesty to meet Consort Hua.

557
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,700
Enough.

558
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,600
If Huan did that, she would have told me.

559
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,300
If she didn't, that means she didn't.

560
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,200
We shouldn't listen to rumors.

561
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,800
It's late.

562
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,800
I need to go and visit Empress Dowager. You should leave too.

563
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I'll go first.

564
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,800
Lady, Honored Lady An's words seem to be true.

565
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,955
It might not be a rumor.

566
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,400
I know. Huan must make it clear.

567
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,600
If she asked His Majesty to restore the title,

568
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,400
then she shouldn't be my good sister.

569
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,800
But I don't think she is like that.

570
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,900
Greetings Empress Dowager. Auspicious wishes for the Empress Dowager.

571
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,600
- Stand and talk.<br>- Thank you, Empress Dowager.

572
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,400
Sit down and talk.

573
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,100
It's been a long time that I haven't talked to you.

574
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,200
What keeps you so busy?

575
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,300
Nothing in particular.

576
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,200
Just spending time doing things.

577
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,700
Then tell me how you are spending it.

578
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,000
Listening might bring me some news.

579
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,000
The Imperial Household bred two cranes in the garden.

580
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,000
They look nice.

581
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:58,200
With two deer in the garden, they really reflect the scene of spring.

582
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,400
This medicine is very bitter.

583
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,000
Even my tongue became woody.

584
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,800
Empress Dowager.

585
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,800
Empress Dowager, this is the newly made hawthorn.

586
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,500
It is sweet and sour. It will be good with your medicine. It will suit you the best.

587
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,900
You are so thoughtful.

588
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,200
- It has a nice flavor.<br>- It's good that Empress Dowager likes it.

589
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,000
I was thinking that since your medicine is bitter,

590
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,700
if you had it with something sweet, it might taste worse.

591
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,600
But if you had it with something sweet and sour, it might taste better.

592
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,600
Lady Wan, do you know your mistake?

593
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,200
I'm afraid I don't. Empress Dowager, please tell me.

594
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,700
How dare you, as a Lady, interfere with the government.

595
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,600
- Empress Dowager, she...<br>- I'm asking her. What are you worried about?

596
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,400
I don't understand Empress Dowager.

597
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,900
But I do not dare to make a mistake.

598
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,000
I'll allow you to talk

599
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,000
about the restoration of the title, and how much you are involved.

600
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,500
Empress Dowager, please check clearly. Even when I was young and mischievous,

601
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,700
I understood that I shouldn't be involved in ruling.

602
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,800
His Majesty is a good Emperor.

603
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,300
He had to make a decision about the title being restored.

604
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,400
I can't move him to change his mind.

605
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,400
I was foolish.

606
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,000
I thought the title return was about all the consorts.

607
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,200
So, I dared to say a few words.

608
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,400
About ruling, I really would not dare to interfere.

609
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,700
Even if you never meant to do so,

610
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,200
you dare to say you didn't try to gain something?

611
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,900
I wouldn't lie to Empress Dowager.

612
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,200
His Majesty is an Emperor,

613
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,400
always worrying about the country -- forgetting to eat and sleep.

614
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,500
I am thankful for His Majesty's love, and that I can serve him.

615
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,400
If I wish for anything,

616
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,300
it is for His Majesty to have a long and peaceful life.

617
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,200
And from that, I would benefit, and be at peace until the end.

618
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,000
All the consorts have this same wish.

619
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,900
Fine then, stand.

620
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,300
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

621
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,900
Your wish. It is the same for all of us.

622
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,600
You're here because the Emperor is here.

623
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,300
As long as His Majesty is here, no matter who is in the palace,

624
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,200
you still have hope, a goal.

625
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,400
If His Majesty is gone,

626
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,000
not to say Empress,

627
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,100
as the Empress Dowager

628
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,700
just like Honored Lady Cao,

629
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,800
she can rely upon her daughter.

630
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,700
but you and Mei don't have any children.

631
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,400
You might have a beautiful life, but you may have a sad end.

632
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,500
In a word, waiting for the time to pass.

633
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,900
The only person you can depend upon

634
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,800
is His Majesty.

635
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,600
I heard it from His Majesty

636
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,600
that the title return was your idea.

637
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,300
Yes, Empress Dowager.

638
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,500
Now you dare to say.

639
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,000
Clever, Empress Dowager.

640
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,700
Try to disobey His Majesty.

641
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,900
Even though I'm stupid,

642
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,800
I understand what Empress Dowager means.

643
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,400
I hope Empress Dowager can check clearly,

644
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,500
that in this situation, the government needed to be settled down,

645
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,500
as well as all the consorts.

646
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,900
I wouldn't cause trouble to the country,

647
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,300
just for myself.

648
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,300
Someone had to suffer.

649
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,200
And I wished to be that person.

650
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,900
Nice girl.

651
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,400
I didn't realize you had such thoughts.

652
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,900
That's why His Majesty loves you so much.

653
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,700
And allows you to enter the Imperial Study Room.

654
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,500
Empress Dowager shouldn't say so. I'm not as good as that.

655
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,500
Empress told me that

656
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,600
your accompanying His Majesty would be no problem.

657
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,900
I didn't feel that way.

658
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,300
How can a consort enter the Imperial Study Room?

659
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,400
But you are so clever.

660
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,300
If you use your cleverness in a bad way,

661
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,700
or encourage His Majesty blindly,

662
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,600
ruling the world by threatening others to follow you,

663
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,800
you'll become a problem for this country.

664
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,100
Then I can't have you in this palace.

665
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,000
I would not dare.

666
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,600
Serve His Majesty well,

667
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,200
so that you may have a child soon.

668
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,800
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

669
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,900
Mei is calm and steady,

670
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,000
while you are clever and smart.

671
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,800
After Empress Chun-Yuan passed away, His Majesty never had

672
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,900
a helpful and understanding person beside him.

673
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,400
If you two serve him with full attention,

674
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,400
I'm sure he'll have nothing to worry about.

675
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,700
Empress Dowager just gave me a big responsibility.

676
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,600
It's my napping time.

677
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,700
You can go and walk around.

678
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,800
I take my leave.

679
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,800
Lady Wan.

680
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,900
There's a saying, that a girl without talent is the best.

681
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,200
But I don't think so.

682
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,400
But if a girl is too clever, she might pay for it with her life.

683
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,700
It's wasted.

684
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,100
A talented girl who knows how to retrieve becomes smart and lucky.

685
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,600
That's the best way to do it.

686
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,600
Even though you are all just consorts in the palace,

687
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,900
with your actions,

688
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,300
you can make a great change.

689
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,300
Beware of your talk and movements.

690
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,600
Yes, Empress Dowager.

691
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,500
Where is Sister Mei?

692
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,600
She took the servants and went to the kitchen.

693
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,600
Seems she's making dessert for Empress Dowager.

694
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,600
She might not come back early.

695
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,200
Let's go home.

696
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,700
Lady.

697
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,000
Speak.

698
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,700
This afternoon, I saw Lady Hui.

699
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,900
She was very angry, rushing from Palace of Long and Healthy Life.

700
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,400
Then I saw Lady Wan leaving as well.

701
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,300
Not sure, but maybe Lady Hui disturbed the Empress Dowager.

702
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,700
If she disturbed the Empress Dowager, why would she be angry?

703
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,600
If Lady Hui was seen angry, she probably found out

704
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,600
that it was Lady Wan who asked for the title return.

705
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,600
But Lady Hui last told you, she didn't believe it.

706
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,300
She wouldn't believe my words.

707
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,500
But later, she discovered the truth.

708
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,300
Because she had doubted it, that's why she's so angry.

709
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,000
I really wish to know.

710
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,200
Since she is so close to Lady Wan,

711
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,200
will she really trust her

712
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,200
to where she never doubts her.
