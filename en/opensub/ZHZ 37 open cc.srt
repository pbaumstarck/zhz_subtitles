00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Episode 37

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,000
How does it smell?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,900
Sister Cao.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,700
Greetings, Lady Wan.

5
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,800
Sister, please, stand.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,800
Sister is in a really good mood.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,200
Wen-Yi wants to go out and play everyday.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,000
This little child is giving me such a headache.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,046
Not everyone can be as happy as you.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,400
Let me hold her for a while.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,100
My goodness, Princess Wen-Yi.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,800
Stop it, Wen-Yi. Greet Consort Wan.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,100
- Consort.<br>- It's okay. She is so adorable.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,600
Give Consort Wan a kiss.

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,000
Here.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,100
Good. Careful of your clothes.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,400
Consort Bin has something to say to you.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,100
The sunshine is very good today.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,300
I think I'll take a walk in the spring garden.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,100
I'll leave first.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Farewell, Consort Wan.

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,900
Sister Cao.

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,300
Do you have something to tell me?

24
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,500
Consort Hua's position has been restored.

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,400
Yesterday, Consort Hua invited me to the Palace of Supporting Earth.

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,300
That's good.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,800
Sister Cao has had a constant relationship with Consort Hua all this time.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,900
Now that she has been restored, you should go and congratulate her.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,100
Yes, I have already sent presents.

30
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,000
It's just that, Consort Hua has asked some questions

31
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,100
about your actions during her captivity.

32
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,263
You are a smart person.

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,500
You will be able to handle it well.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,400
No matter what,

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,700
it's still in your control.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,700
Nothing is in my control.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,100
It all depends on you.

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,900
No matter what, Consort Hua is still your previous master.

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,600
Although she has mistreated you and the Princess,

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,475
she has also helped you.

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,400
Her family status is far above my own.

42
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,100
It's natural you would want to maintain

43
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
your close relationship with Consort Hua.

44
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,500
There is no need for you to deny me.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,400
Although I am not that smart, I know that the restoration of Consort Hua is just temporary.

46
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,300
No matter what, her end will come soon.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,400
I will not take that risk, for the sake of the Princess and myself.

48
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,100
Your observation skill is better than anybody else.

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,700
Actually, I wish for you and Consort Hua to maintain a close relationship.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,363
Princess and I have surrendered ourselves to you.

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,819
We only listen to your orders.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,700
How can I serve her as well?

53
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,400
I understand your meaning.

54
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,500
I will not disappoint you.

55
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,667
You are very smart.

56
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,100
I won't have to worry.

57
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,444
Since Consort Hua wants to spy on my actions,

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,500
I will return it to her by her own means.

59
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,200
What does she think of her restoration?

60
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,400
Consort Hua is delighted with it.

61
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,700
But she is always in fear that she may be neglected again.

62
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,700
She is cautious of you

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,100
because she has been neglected before,

64
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,800
and she heard about the incident between Consort Qi and Lady Fuca.

65
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,100
She has treated me like an enemy for a long time.

66
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,500
Of course, the same goes for me.

67
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,702
You will have your own method of dealing with her.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,200
I'm just providing some assistance to you.

69
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,000
There is one thing.

70
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,470
I have no direct, mutual relationship with you.

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,500
If we stand together, it's because of some certain mutual benefit.

72
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,500
We may even separate one day.

73
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,700
I know my own status.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,200
I know I'm no match for you.

75
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,100
I only worry that I won't be of much help to you.

76
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,239
Good, Sister.

77
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,000
Then your problem will be my problem.

78
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,800
I don't have a child yet.

79
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,500
Princess Wen-Yi is very adorable.

80
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,700
I wish to keep her as my step-daughter after everything is finished.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,100
Then, both of us can rely upon each other.

82
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,300
What do you think?

83
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,600
If that's the case, both of us will feel better.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,800
You have a bright future.

85
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,300
Wen-Yi will be blessed to have such a person as her step-mother.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,400
Sister, this looks familiar.

87
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,500
I think I've seen it before in His Majesty's chamber.

88
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,300
It is a gift from His Majesty?

89
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,900
Yes, it is just a small novelty.

90
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,200
Sister, you have a beautiful hand.

91
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,200
It's a pity you only used jasmine lacquer.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,600
His Majesty will like it better,

93
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,900
if you put some interesting decoration on it.

94
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,200
Thank you for the advice.

95
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Officer Wen is in a hurry today.

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,100
No time, even for tea.

97
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,300
There's no need to show me out.

98
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,000
Consort Wan's medicine is still cooking.

99
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,900
I'm worried the eunuchs will not properly tend to the medicine,

100
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,300
and miss the time when the medicine is most effective.

101
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,726
Consort Wan is ill?

102
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,600
No, it's just the special face power used by Consort Wan.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Those eunuchs are careless, so I have to supervise them.

104
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,100
It's just a small matter.

105
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,600
His Majesty now favors Consort Wan a lot.

106
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,400
Now that she has His Majesty's attention, she doesn't care about the special medicine.

107
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,900
Consort Wan has grown to be very important.

108
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,000
Everybody is moving to her side.

109
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,200
I think I should have to avoid her for a while.

110
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,300
Doctor Wen, I think you are rushing to help her as well.

111
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,100
Master, why would you say something like that?

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,700
My mood is not good, and I have offended you.

113
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,600
But I have to give you a piece of advice.

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,300
No one remembers those who rise in times of glory.

115
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,300
People remember those who help in times of need.

116
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,400
Sir, I trust you understand what I'm saying.

117
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,237
It's my responsibility to formulate new medicines.

118
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,100
Just as it is to serve you when you are ill.

119
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
I don't dislike helping during times of glory.

120
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,900
I sincerely hope that neither Consort Wan

121
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,000
nor you would need my help during a time of need.

122
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,000
I wish that Doctor Wen would treat

123
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,100
me and my sister equally.

124
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,675
Both you and your sister are people I tend to.

125
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,300
I have no other intentions.

126
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,260
Cai-Yue, show Doctor Wen to the door.

127
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,800
Yes.

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,200
Farewell, Doctor Wen.

129
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,900
Master.

130
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,966
Sister, why do you stand in front of the door?

131
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,800
You will catch a cold.

132
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,800
Sister, why are you here today?

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,700
Don't you need to accompany His Majesty in visiting Consort Hua?

134
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,200
Sister, don't be angry.

135
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,363
I've come here today,

136
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,200
to explain this matter to you.

137
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,800
I'm tired. I want to take a nap.

138
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,500
I'll be going to the Empress' palace later. Please return.

139
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,600
I know you are angry.

140
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
But please, listen to me for a moment.

141
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,200
Do you not care about our past relationship?

142
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,400
Come in.

143
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,000
Why is nobody here?

144
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,000
Where are the servants? Why is there no one here to serve you?

145
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,690
The palace officials are distributing summer clothes today.

146
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,300
I told them to get it from the Imperial Household.

147
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,300
It's different from your court.

148
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,154
where everybody wants to go.

149
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,800
Eunuch Lee from the Imperial Household,

150
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,700
will personally send the summer uniform to your servants.

151
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,600
I know.

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You don't care about being neglected by His Majesty.

153
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Sister only cares about

154
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,800
the restoration of Consort Hua.

155
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,360
Fine, let me ask you then.

156
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,800
Are you the one who suggested to restore Consort Hua to His Majesty?

157
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,500
Yes.

158
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But Sister, I was forced to do it.

159
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,700
Who would be willing to help the person who killed her own son?

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,100
Please Sister, think of it from my point of view.

161
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,100
Why would I do that,

162
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
if I wasn't forced to?

163
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:03,000
My sufferings were no less than yours.

164
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,900
Then why did you do it?

165
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,100
Sister, think about it. It was to calm down Nian Gengyao.

166
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,500
His Majesty has to restore Nian Shi-Lan's position sooner or later.

167
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,500
The lowest rank being the position of Consort.

168
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,100
If the situation were to worsen,

169
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,200
we'd have to promote her to Imperial Consort.

170
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,629
Although you have captured the heart of Empress Dowager,

171
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,200
you wouldn't have been able to prevent this matter from happening.

172
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,900
Since the situation was like that, I was willing to be the one who suggested it.

173
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,800
His Majesty would feel regret because of what happened to me.

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And my position in the court would become more stable.

175
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,724
Although you have explained everything so clearly,

176
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,769
I really still don't understand.

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,600
Now she is a Consort,

178
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,700
it only becomes easier for her to become an Imperial Consort.

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,500
Even if you think of everything, she may not fall into your trap.

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,400
Yes, I don't know when I

181
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,300
became so calculating and selfish.

182
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,000
I know

183
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,600
that I am no longer a naive person with a pure heart.

184
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,000
But I have a strong reason

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,700
for what I doing.

186
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,500
Fine, fine. You have your reasons, and I have mine.

187
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,900
It's hard for me to talk to you right now.

188
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,400
I think you wanted to side with Nian Gengyao because he is more powerful.

189
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,800
You used the position of Consort Hua to build up your relationship with him.

190
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,500
Sister,

191
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,900
am I this kind of dishonorable person in your eyes?

192
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,223
Did you forget

193
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,600
how I lost my son?

194
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,900
Huan, we have been together since we were children.

195
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,000
I know I am not as smart nor as beautiful as you.

196
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,200
So I try to improve myself as much as possible to find a good man.

197
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,500
You are good at dancing, while I am good at playing the zither.

198
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,700
I never did anything better than you.

199
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,600
After that, we entered the palace together.

200
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,200
We helped each other.

201
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,100
Although His Majesty neglected me,

202
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,300
I never hated you.

203
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,100
But for some reason I don't know,

204
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,600
whenever I see you,

205
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,100
I feel faraway from you.

206
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,083
You have an admirer like Doctor Wen.

207
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,100
You are adored by His Majesty.

208
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,800
Your father is His Majesty's favorite officer.

209
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,200
You have the whole world with you.

210
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,700
But I don't have anything.

211
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,200
I still remember the paper boats

212
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,800
we put into the water when we were little.

213
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,888
Grandmother said the further apart the boats went,

214
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,100
the further apart we'd be married.

215
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,338
But you said

216
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,900
that our boats should float together,

217
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,600
so that we'd be married to a pair of brothers.

218
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,100
Then we could be together forever.

219
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,700
Now it seems we are together

220
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,400
but actually we are very far apart.

221
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,700
Sister, do you want us to separate?

222
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,682
Yes. Every relationship must come to an end.

223
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,600
There is nothing that lasts forever.

224
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Return now. You need not come here again unless there is a matter that concerns you.

225
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,100
You will understand me one day.

226
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,500
Perhaps.

227
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,900
If you don't want me to visit you anymore,

228
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,500
then I will only visit you, once I have succeeded.

229
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,500
Greetings, Your Highness.

230
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,700
Greetings, to all.

231
00:15:00,808 --> 00:15:03,760
- Stand.<br>- Thank you, Empress.

232
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,400
Lady Hui is here as well.

233
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,200
It's been a long since I've had all of you here gathered together.

234
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,758
I'm busy accompanying Empress Dowager, so I am unable to come here often.

235
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,300
It is almost time

236
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,900
for Empress Dowager to take her medicine.

237
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,700
I have to go now.

238
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,305
It's good that the Empress Dowager likes you.

239
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,800
You should go then.

240
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,500
Consort Wan, come take a seat.

241
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,200
Lady Hui likes to act like this lately,

242
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:44,180
you don't take it seriously.

243
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,100
Sister Mei is feeling weak lately

244
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Maybe its because of the weather.

245
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
Its normal to get a flu when the weather is bad.

246
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,100
But no matter what, girls should always take care of their health.

247
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,900
Don't be like Consort Duan. Now she's having a terrible illness.

248
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes.

249
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,200
His Majesty told me that you never met your parents since you entered into the palace.

250
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,400
So I have arranged for your mother to enter into the palace today.

251
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,400
You go and wait for her at the House of Broken Jade.

252
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,000
Thank you, Empress.

253
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,800
Go and prepare now.

254
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,000
Your mother and sister will enter into the palace in the late afternoon.

255
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,700
Yes.

256
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,700
You are all dismissed.

257
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,700
Consort On, Please stay here.

258
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,800
Yes.

259
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,100
Farewell, Your Highness.

260
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,000
Empress.

261
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,300
Just now you saw it.

262
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,600
Lady Hui Dan and Consort Wan are like complete strangers.

263
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,700
Both of their family status is very high in the court.

264
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,400
There will be a lot of trouble if both of them formed an alliance.

265
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,158
I also think so.

266
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,000
It will be trouble if Lady Hui Dan and Consort Wan formed an alliance together, similar to those of Consort Hua.

267
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,600
You are right.

268
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,700
His Majesty can pamper anyone.

269
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,300
But he cannot pamper anyone with the the likes of Consort Hua.

270
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,400
Mother, why are we not there yet?

271
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,800
Shut up. This is the Forbidden Palace.

272
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,200
There is no place larger than this.

273
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,026
Of course it may take some time.

274
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:31,100
Watch your mouth when you see your sister later.

275
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,400
Understand?

276
00:17:32,502 --> 00:17:33,428
Yes.

277
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,500
Madam Zhen and your sister wish to meet you.

278
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,800
Summon them quickly.

279
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,400
Mother.

280
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,017
Greetings, Lady Consort Wan.

281
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,400
Stand up, quickly.

282
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,800
Thank you.

283
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,930
Mother, you must tired from the long journey. Please sit.

284
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:05,787
Huan-Bi, prepare some tea.

285
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,100
Sit.

286
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,100
Come.

287
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,700
Huan-Bi has become more beautiful

288
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,500
after you have changed your status.

289
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Thank you, madam.

290
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,211
Its hard for you to come here mother, why don't you give me some praise?

291
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:27,505
Of course my lady, you are the most beautiful one.

292
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,800
Sister, your shoes are so beautiful.

293
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,400
Everything in this house is so beautiful.

294
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,000
Yu-Rao

295
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,300
This is just a pair of normal shoes worn by master.

296
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,300
His Majesty has given another pair of shoes to master.

297
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,200
It was made from a special cloth with many pearls on it.

298
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,100
Those shoes are very beautiful.

299
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,900
On my way here, I have heard that His Majesty has treated my lady very well.

300
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,600
Madam, please have some tea.

301
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,200
This is the precious tea leaf of this year's tribute.

302
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,800
I can't drink this precious tea.

303
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,800
Mother, Its just a tea leaf.

304
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,800
I know you like to drink tea. Come, drink it.

305
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,100
You still remember, thank you.

306
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,800
This is the favourite dessert for you and miss.

307
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,500
Master had prepared it before you came here.

308
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,300
Master was very happy when she heard you were both coming.

309
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,700
Master, just now, Lady An sent Ju-Qing to bring something.

310
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,100
She said it is for you. I have to keep it for you first.

311
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,600
You are all dismissed now.

312
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,400
I want to have a nice chat with my mother and sister.

313
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,100
Yes.

314
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,800
Let me have a look at you.

315
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,100
Master.

316
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,700
Have you sent it over there?

317
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,100
Good

318
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,400
That is a precious medicine sent by the Governor of Shandong.

319
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,300
I think Lady Zhen will like it.

320
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,800
Good. Dismissed.

321
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,700
Yes.

322
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,700
Who she think she is?

323
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,500
Everything in the palace is good.

324
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,800
I still remember when i first enter into the Zhen's chamber.

325
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,600
Everything I saw is beautiful.

326
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,000
I never saw anything like it before.

327
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,700
Now it's also the time for me to send a gift to them.

328
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,700
Master is really very kind.

329
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,300
Not that I'm kind.

330
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,200
Its just that today I am on the higher rank,

331
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,800
I don't need other people to pity me anymore.

332
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,900
Congratulations, master.

333
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,600
I don't know

334
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,600
when my parents can come to visit me.

335
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
There will be such a day, don't worry master.

336
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,900
Maybe after you get pregnant

337
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,000
your mother can come in too.

338
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,400
But Her Majesty will not allow me to get pregnant.

339
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,800
Her Majesty will allow you to have a baby soon.

340
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,600
I am willing to draw His Majesty's attention rather than waiting for a baby.

341
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,200
By that time, I will be at the same level with Consort Wan.

342
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,400
Then my parents can come to visit me in the palace proudly.

343
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,200
Sister, are you happy in the palace?

344
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,200
Does brother-in-law treat you well?

345
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:25,100
His Majesty has treated me very well.

346
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,300
It's just that sometimes I have to think of something to make him happy.

347
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,500
It's quite tiring.

348
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,200
That's why you've become slim.

349
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,300
Yes, that why I'm thin.

350
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,200
And you must have eaten too much food. You have grown taller and fatter.

351
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,700
My lady has become thin. You had a miscarriage last time.

352
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,400
Is your body well?

353
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,800
Doctor Wen is looking after me.

354
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,600
Now I feel much better.

355
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,000
Good, you are still young.

356
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,100
You can have a baby after you recover.

357
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,600
Besides, His Majesty ha treated you so well.

358
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,100
Everybody think I have all the glory.

359
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,200
But in here, It's more easier to get a precious jewellery than a lover.

360
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,800
My lady, it's not good to say all of those things in the palace.

361
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,200
Not even in front of a parrot.

362
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,100
Mother is so cautious.

363
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,400
Love between a pair of lover is protected by nothing but cautiousness.

364
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,800
Not to mention, this is the royal family.

365
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,700
My lady still has a gap between His Majesty and you.

366
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,200
I will always remember your teaching.

367
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,600
Besides from His Majesty,

368
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,300
you should be cautious in everything you are doing.

369
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,800
One consort has caused enough trouble for you.

370
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,200
Not to mention there is still many people in the palace.

371
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,500
I know you treat Huan-Bi very well,

372
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,200
But its just not good for a servant to

373
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,900
make herself up too well.

374
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,600
Huan-Bi and Liu-Zhu are my good friends since we were small.

375
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,500
We are just friends.

376
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,600
No matter what, do not have any ties with her.

377
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,900
That is your own blood sister.

378
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,100
I don't care once I enter into this confused palace.

379
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,000
I just wish to find a good husband for Yu-Rao.

380
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,500
Yu-Rao is also the same with you. I think it's hard.

381
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,900
That's why i have to give all my effort.

382
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,500
For you and father and also for Yu-Rao.

383
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,300
We know your effort.

384
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,200
Your father is also worried about you.

385
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:43,300
He felt regret for not being able to help you.

386
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,400
My lady, the time has come.

387
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,100
Madam and miss have to go now.

388
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,400
My lady, we have to go now.

389
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,300
Why do you leave in such a rush?

390
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,800
Mother, why don't you stay for a bit longer.

391
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,500
It's not convenient here.

392
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,500
I'm worried people may say something bad about you.

393
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,300
Actually, your father also didn't let me visit you.

394
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,600
He's scared others may say something bad about it.

395
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,100
I don't know

396
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,200
when i can meet you again next time.

397
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,100
You have to depend on yourself now.

398
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,200
Don't worry, mother.

399
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,500
Let's go.

400
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,900
Consort Wan's relatives have left so early.

401
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,300
<br>

402
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,200
Pity her. It's hard for her mother to enter into the palace.

403
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,600
Last time, my parents always enter into the palace.

404
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,000
Consort Wan can also have the same privilege in the matter.

405
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,100
His Majesty has promoted Consort Wan's father just for the sake of her.

406
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,300
No matter what, he is just an ordinary officer.

407
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,300
His Majesty has arrived.

408
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,700
What is so funny?

409
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

410
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,000
I was just joking with Song-Zhi.

411
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,300
Saying that the weather is getting hotter and plan to take a vacation with you at the summer palace.

412
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,400
If not, we may become baked potatoes here.

413
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,800
I always bring you to the Summer Palace.

414
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,800
Your Majesty, dinner is served.

415
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,600
I have asked the imperial chef to prepare many of your favourite dishes.

416
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,300
Good.

417
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,200
This herbs was mixed with what kind of spices?

418
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,200
Last time the soap was made by wrapping the nard, angelica root, guizhi, and bamboo leaf together with animal pancreas,

419
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,400
then placing it in the sun.

420
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
My lady doesn't like the smell of guizhi.

421
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,300
so we changed it into magnolia and added some santalaceae.

422
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,200
It will smell better and it is good for the hand.

423
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,200
I didn't know you knew all these things before.

424
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,000
My lady is very cautious when she is using this kind of things.

425
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,600
I'm just testing it for my lady.

426
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,600
I'm impressed you know all these things.

427
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,300
Your hands are so white and soft.

428
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,600
That's why Consort Hua used things that you have tried.

429
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I still remember that your name is Song-Zhi.

430
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,200
Your Majesty, my surname is Qiao.

431
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,600
Song-Zhi is the name given to me by my lady.

432
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,800
What a good name.

433
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,500
It;s time to have dinner.

434
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,900
Yes.

435
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
You can just ask the servants to do it.

436
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,400
You don't need to do it personally.

437
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,300
Song-Zhi, take the food to His Majesty.

438
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,300
You just do as His Majesty told you.

439
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,800
Yes.

440
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,000
Your kitchen prepared some delicious food.

441
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,700
If you don't like it then its no use

442
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,300
no matter how nice the food was.

443
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
You are trying to tell me something.

444
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,400
I don't know how to speak very well.

445
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,500
But you have people that know how to speak.

446
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,400
That means you are very good in teaching them.

447
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,400
You're right.

448
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,100
I didn't see sister and sister Wan together for a long time.

449
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,200
Did something happen?

450
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,500
His majesty is always there, its inconvenient for me to go there.

451
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,500
Besides, I'm busy serving dowager,

452
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,100
thus we were not able to meet.

453
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,800
That's good. I was thinking too much.

454
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,200
I've not seen you and sister together for quite a while.

455
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,700
I thought the both of you quarreled.

456
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
What makes you think so?

457
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,100
If our relationship is close,

458
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,800
nothing can separate us.

459
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,800
I was worried, so I asked.

460
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,800
Please forgive me Sister.

461
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,400
Its not the first day I've known you.

462
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,500
If not you will not come here to tell me

463
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,700
about Consort Wan advising his majesty to restore Consort Hua's position.

464
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,300
I'm just worried about the both of you.

465
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,300
Worried? If you truly are,

466
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,400
you would not have used Bao-Jun's to tell me.

467
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,600
You are as cunning as Consort Wan.

468
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,000
Are you blaming me?

469
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,200
We both have a common enemy, Consort Hua.

470
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,200
That's why I'm worried that Sister Wan will make a mistake.

471
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,900
You can tell her directly if you're worried

472
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,700
that she'll make a mistake.

473
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,500
Sister, don't be angry.

474
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,700
Its all Ling Rong's fault

475
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,300
causing sister to be angry.

476
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,900
No need.

477
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,100
You don't need to spend energy explaining it to me.

478
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,500
You can save your breath for his majesty.

479
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,600
And advice his majesty to punish Consort Hua.

480
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,400
I'm useless.

481
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,800
Being useless is just a small problem,

482
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,900
it will be a big problem if you act immorally and instigate people.

483
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,600
Yes sister, you're right.

484
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,300
Its not that I want to speak ill of you, we are friends after all.

485
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,400
Its okay to speak frankly to each other.

486
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,400
There is no need to have any secrets between us.

487
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,600
It will be difficult to lead such a life.

488
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,400
If you are like this again in the future,

489
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,800
you can just tell her directly.

490
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,800
There is no need to let me know.

491
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,300
Lady Hui is really direct.

492
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,700
I think she's changed alot after his majesty neglected her.

493
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,800
She's been like this all this while, she has never changed.

494
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,200
What are they holding in their hands?

495
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,100
This road leads to the house of broken jade.

496
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,000
Maybe its medicine for health.

497
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,400
Is Consort Wan still taking any medication?

498
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,800
I heard that Consort Wan's body is still weak after the miscarriage.

499
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
That's why his majesty has ordered this.

500
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,700
Consort Wan is indeed his majesty's favorite among the 3 of us.

501
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,900
Her majesty is right. After Consort Wan has gained his majesty's favor,

502
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,500
all those around her will naturally benefit.

503
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,500
But it seems that Lady Wan has stayed

504
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,000
away from master after she recovered.

505
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,700
I'll visit her if she doesn't come see me.

506
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,700
Go and get a pack of health medication from the pharmacy.

507
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,200
Yes.

508
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,700
You sure spoke well just now.

509
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,400
Why did you speak of a word now?

510
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,400
Please forgive me, my lady.

511
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,800
Forgive you? What have you done wrong?

512
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Don't you just like to show your claws in front of his majesty?

513
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,100
My lady, my lady.

514
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,900
You can give the comb to me if its not to your liking.

515
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,300
Its a waste to throw such a beautiful comb.

516
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,500
Miss Song Zhi, the medicine for my lady is still brewing outside,

517
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,100
go and monitor the fire.

518
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,700
Don't be angry my lady.

519
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,700
His majesty is only giving her a small praise.

520
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,300
What harm can it do?

521
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,600
It will be trouble if his majesty knows that you're angry.

522
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,800
Even seducer has appeared around me.

523
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,800
Sweet talk and showing off her claws.

524
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,700
My lady, every girl in the palace is for his majesty's picking.

525
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,700
Its normal for you to be concerned about his majesty.

526
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,300
But my lady now is pregnant,

527
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,300
you have to pretend to be tolerant even if his majesty likes Lady Song Shi.

528
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,400
Don't let his majesty think that you're a narrow minded person with no tolerance.

529
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,200
My lady, your main objective now is making his majesty happy.

530
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,500
I will ask her to leave the palace tomorrow.

531
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,000
So that she can't meet his majesty.

532
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,300
My lady, please do not show your anger on your face.

533
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,900
You even have to praise Lady Song Zhi.

534
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,600
Then will he feel your tolerance

535
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,300
and can use that as an excuse to shut people up.

536
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,200
I have nothing to hide anyway.

537
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,700
My lady, be careful of gossips.

538
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,700
I'm not afraid of gossips.

539
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,100
I'm just worried that his majesty will believe in those gossip.

540
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,100
I know.

541
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,300
My lady cares about his majesty the most.

542
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
Give this to Song Zhi.

543
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,700
Brilliant my lady, I will do it right away.

544
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,700
Hand me the medicine Bao-Juan.

545
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,900
Is it done? <br> Yes.

546
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,000
I've did it as you instructed.

547
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,300
Did you use the best medicine?

548
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,900
Yes.

549
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,500
Good, Sister Wan is weak now.

550
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,400
She has to take some tonic.

551
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,800
Master, what are you doing?

552
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,800
How can there be no medicine usher accompanying such a good brew?

553
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,600
The best medicine usher is human blood.

554
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,500
How can you hurt yourself?

555
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,100
Let me do it<br> No need.

556
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,300
Master let me do it.<br> No need.

557
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,500
Huan-Bi, what time is it?

558
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,700
Sister has awaken.

559
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,600
You're here.

560
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,700
I've cooked some medicine for you.

561
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,200
I've cooked it according to Doctor Wen's prescription.

562
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
I've also added some useful herbs.

563
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,500
You'll recover soon once you've drank it.

564
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,700
But Doctor Wen

565
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,000
didn't prescribe any new prescription for me.

566
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,200
Sister, its best that you drink it while its hot.

567
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,900
What is this? Why is it so smelly?

568
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,300
Come.

569
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,500
Sister, don't be worried.

570
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,100
I've tried it, its ok.

571
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,000
Don't you trust me anymore?

572
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,100
What happened?

573
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,000
Nothing, its just some small injury.

574
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,500
What happened to your hand?

575
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,500
What happened?

576
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:20,200
Although you have recovered from your miscarriage, your body is still weak.

577
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,300
I read in an ancient prescription that said human blood is the most effective.

578
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,200
That's why I gave it a try.

579
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,100
I wish you to have a healthy body soon

580
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
and help his majesty have babies.

581
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,500
You're crazy. How can you take an ancient remedy seriously?

582
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,100
Besides, I'm not suffering from any serious illness.

583
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,800
I will recover from taking some medicine.

584
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I don't care. I just want you to have a healthy body

585
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,900
and be able to give birth again.

586
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,100
I've noticed that we've distanced from each other

587
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,700
ever since his majesty is giving you his attention again.

588
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,300
I didn't know if it was because His Majesty loves me as well,

589
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,700
or if you blamed me for not being able to rescue you

590
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,500
from the Palace of Supporting Earth,

591
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,600
which caused you to lose your baby.

592
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,200
Don't think too much, Sister.

593
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,900
I have nobody in this palace

594
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,900
besides you and his majesty.

595
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,200
If you distance yourself from me because of the attention that his majesty has given you,

596
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,000
I'd rather only have you.

597
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Ling-Rong, that was not what I meant.

598
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:35,400
Sister, Sister Mei has stayed away from me.

599
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,800
Are you leaving me too?

600
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,200
3 of us entered the palace together.

601
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,000
Although my relationship with you is nothing compared to Sister Mei,

602
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,500
But I will never forget the times

603
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,500
that we went through together in Zhen's house.

604
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,300
Yes, even with my good intentions in mind,

605
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,500
why do you need to hurt yourself?

606
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,400
Because you are the only one willing to help me.

607
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,000
If you don't trust me,

608
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,600
then who will?

609
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,500
Yes, we will age quickly.

610
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,100
But its pity to lose our friendship before we are old.

611
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,800
Only you and Sister Mei

612
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,700
will keep me company when I'm old.

613
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,500
No. His majesty will not neglect you.

614
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,200
I will always be by your side.

615
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,200
Ok, don't be sad anymore.

616
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,400
If you really want,

617
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,000
you can copy some Buddha scriptures for my child.

618
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,800
Hope that he can reach heaven soon.

619
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,100
I have copied a lot.

620
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,900
Great!

621
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,900
I've been feeling tired these days,

622
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,775
why don't you send the scriptures

623
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,900
to Bao Hua temple and burn it to my child.

624
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,400
Its the least that I can do for my baby.

625
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,077
Pass me your copied scriptures to me then.

626
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,800
I will go there now.

627
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,900
Huan-Bi, go and take the scriptures and accompany Lady An to Bao Hua temple.

628
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,800
Yes.

629
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Sister, take a good rest.

630
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,300
I will go there immediately.

631
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,900
Master, do you want to drink this medicine?

632
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,400
I will not drink any medicine that is not prescribed by Doctor Wen.

633
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,100
Throw it away.

634
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,400
Lady An treated you well.

635
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:56,700
I don't need her to do this.

636
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:02,000
I just wish that she still has a truthful heart for our sisterhood.
