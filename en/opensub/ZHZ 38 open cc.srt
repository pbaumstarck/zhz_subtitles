00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,900
Episode 38

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,000
Greetings, Empress.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,000
May you enjoy great fortune.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,100
Rise.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,700
Thank you, Empress.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,600
It's been a long time since I've met all of you here.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,200
If only everyone is the palace were as<br> harmonious as all of you.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,900
Jiejie and I have always gotten along quite well.

9
00:00:31,956 --> 00:00:35,547
The temperatures are getting high lately, his majesty suggest to go to Yuan Ming garden.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,800
We will be leaving in a few days time.<br>Do prepare in advance

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,600
for things and people that you want to bring along.

12
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:42,912
Yes.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,900
Your highness

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,200
ever since the empress has fallen ill, she has never left the palace to escape from the summer heat.

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,500
I would wish to stay to accompany the empress.

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,900
To contribute some filial piety.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,100
It is naturally good that you have this intention.

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,800
Thank you your highness.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,800
Everything has already been arranged.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,500
His majesty is still at Kyushu,

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,400
The empress is at plum flower

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,600
Consort is still at Bluish Wood Library.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,900
Isn't Lady An staying at House of Flourish?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,200
Why are we going this way?

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,000
Lady An is staying in the House of the Free Moon now.

26
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,000
According to His Majesty,

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,300
You and Lady An are very close.

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,000
Therefore, it is good for you to be near each other.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,800
His Majesty is nearby as well.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,300
I have something to do.

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,900
You can leave first

32
00:01:48,948 --> 00:01:50,788
Yes.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,700
Are you feeling sad for Lady Hui?

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,600
She was amazing last year,

35
00:02:06,646 --> 00:02:09,567
now that Ling Rong has moved into the House of Free moon,

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
things have changed.

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,300
I'm afraid that I'll feel sad when I go there.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,400
Its good that you care about her.

39
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,900
But you have to know that,

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,900
there are a lot of women in this palace.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Today you may be favored, but tomorrow, <br>she could be favored.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,100
It isn't set in stone

43
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,400
Although you care about Lady Hui,

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,800
but you don't have to be sad about it.

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,300
Jin-Xi,

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,100
I have always cared about the little things in life.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,900
You are sentimental sometimes.

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,600
But, only gentle people would think too much.

49
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Cruel people will never do so.

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,100
Your soft heart is your flaw.

51
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,700
You've always think too much.

52
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,100
Consort Wan!

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,400
Consort Wan!

54
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,100
Get down 4th prince! Be careful.

55
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:14,272
Come down quickly

56
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,400
Greetings empress, Consort Wan.

57
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:23,147
Why did you climb so high?

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,800
Aren't you afraid of falling down?

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,600
No one else cares about me other than grandmother Mo.

60
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,000
Silly child

61
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,000
I heard that father is here. I wanted to greet him, but he doesn't wish to see me.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,400
So I climbed all the way up there to see if I could spot his majesty.

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,500
I will bring you to him if you want to see him.

64
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,400
But your father is discussing things with some officers,

65
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,300
he's going to be busy.

66
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,100
How about you go home first. When his majesty is free, I'll call you.

67
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:54,410
Thank you, Empress!

68
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,000
I just want to see father.

69
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,900
Go along now

70
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh empress, this is for you.

71
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,500
Your majesty.,

72
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,500
Nian Genyao used the credits,

73
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,988
that he doesn't deserve when the government needs power from the military.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,100
He went into collusion.

75
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,700
And tried to gain extra advantages for his subordinate.

76
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,900
Nian Genyao's servant,Wei Zhi-Yao has always been arrogant.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,200
He actually made the officers

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
kneel down

79
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:39,244
when he entered the capital.

80
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,500
Yet he just passed them by.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,200
Your majesty,

82
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,300
Nian Gengyao has been rude to us.

83
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:52,161
He used some excuses to hold the children.

84
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,600
of many officers in his camps.

85
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,200
After Wang Yun-Ji retired,

86
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,400
Nian Gengyao ordered him to send one to him to train him.

87
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,000
But he actually held him as hostage,

88
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,600
and forced the officers to obey him.

89
00:05:07,677 --> 00:05:08,676
Fine.

90
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,154
This is a big matter.

91
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,100
We will stop here first.

92
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:24,437
Ask Zhang Ting-Yu and Long Kodo to see me tomorrow.

93
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:26,391
Leave first.

94
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,100
Thank you, your majesty.

95
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,500
Empress,

96
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,500
Where is his majesty?

97
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,900
He can't come and have dinner with you today.

98
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:44,554
Please enjoy your meal.

99
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,700
And his majesty can't

100
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,326
come and keep you company as he is busy with state affairs these days.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,600
I will take my leave first.

102
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,900
Stand up.

103
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,300
I have asked everyone besides his majesty,

104
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,400
so Zhen Yuan Dao reported about my brother and his subordinates.

105
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,200
His majesty has sent the ministry of justice to probe into those things.

106
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,400
They said that

107
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,800
my brother tried to bribe by using his position.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,100
And depended on his subordinate to get extra money.

109
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,300
His majesty hates greedy people.

110
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,800
How can he be so careless?

111
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,700
And pissed his majesty off.

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,300
Its Zhen Yuan-Dao's fault.

113
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,200
Zhen Yuan-Dao is going against me for his daughter's sake.

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,400
I wonder if his majesty will lie the blame on my brother.

115
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:50,633
Its the thing of the servants.

116
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:52,709
It should not involve General Nian.

117
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,566
Some fools reported on General Nian in the past.

118
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:59,820
They were excused by his majesty in the end.

119
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:03,024
Its because his majesty has always protected my brother.

120
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,155
Now he has sent people to investigate,

121
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:10,024
if my brother knew about the things that Wei Zhi-Hao was doing.

122
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:13,849
It means that he has suspected my brother.

123
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:19,590
Empress, it is common for his majesty to follow the rules.

124
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:22,929
My brother's subordinate

125
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:26,501
still tried to hide it for Wei Zhi-Yao.

126
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:31,046
Now his thinks that my brother's subordinate are protecting each other.

127
00:07:31,046 --> 00:07:33,784
That's why he sent men to question my brother.

128
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:37,496
No wonder,

129
00:07:39,455 --> 00:07:42,337
his majesty has not been visiting me.

130
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:45,832
I think that he is partly blaming me too.

131
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,593
Don't be sad,

132
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:51,738
it is hard for you to meet his majesty now.

133
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:55,099
The more you should not speak of General Nian now.

134
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,200
What should I do now?

135
00:07:58,748 --> 00:08:02,947
I can't say anything.

136
00:08:03,512 --> 00:08:07,312
Empress, I think that you

137
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:11,649
have to pacify his majesty.

138
00:08:12,097 --> 00:08:15,558
Then, I will get Lady Cao to speak up for me.

139
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:20,236
No. She isn't the one whom his majesty likes the most.

140
00:08:20,236 --> 00:08:22,635
Neither is she someone that his majesty dotes,

141
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,375
it is inconvenient for her to do so.

142
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,279
I will have to arrange for someone

143
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:32,602
to stay by his majesty.

144
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:35,502
so that that person can speak on my behalf.

145
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:11,631
Your majesty, Wei Zhi-Yao is a small case.

146
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:16,754
I was told that Nian Gengyao has sent his family to do business everywhere to earn money.

147
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:19,032
Nian Gengyao's sons have

148
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:21,813
monoplolised the salt business.

149
00:09:21,813 --> 00:09:26,699
Earning more than One hundred and seventy thousand dollars in the past 2 years.

150
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,925
These are only the tip of the ice berg.

151
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:34,390
According to the law of the Qing dynasty, the officers in our dynasty

152
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,669
have to use letters of contract to show that they are fair.

153
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:38,585
But Nian Gengyao used the decree

154
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,463
to contract with those officers.

155
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,466
He took himself as your majesty,

156
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:47,301
Nian Gengyao wrote

157
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:50,832
A poem for your majesty.

158
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:52,609
A few days ago,

159
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:56,059
Nian Gengyao used your name

160
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:58,382
to write a poem.

161
00:09:58,673 --> 00:10:00,510
And spread it to the public.

162
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:03,916
As an officer,

163
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:07,471
it is easy perform merits,

164
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:10,829
but it is hard to be successful.

165
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:12,984
If it is easy to suceed,

166
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:15,387
it will be hard to keep the merits.

167
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,200
If it easy to keep the merits,

168
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,300
it wil be hard to suceed in the end.

169
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,110
If you depend on your merits to create trouble,

170
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:27,103
you will be in trouble in the end.

171
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:32,284
This is common for everyone.

172
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:36,657
Spread this.

173
00:10:37,714 --> 00:10:41,348
Don't let him over estimate himself.

174
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,752
Your majesty, he is pushing his luck

175
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:46,745
and being rebelious.

176
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,100
Nian Gengyao

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,300
did many things for the country.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,600
I don't want to make a clean break with him yet.

179
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,300
Your majesty, its tea time.

180
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,700
Serve it then.

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,400
Your majesty, this is latest Long Jin tea.

182
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,500
Please try it. <br> I did not ask for your opinion, shut up.

183
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,500
Please pardon me.

184
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Song-Zhi,

185
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,000
its you?

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,300
Imperial Consort Hua ordered me to serve you tea.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You look good in this attire.

188
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,900
I will be taking my leave first.

189
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,700
Good bye your majesty.

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,500
Rise.

191
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,000
Did you say that it was Imperial Consort Hua who sent you here?

192
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,200
Greetings Consort Hua.

193
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,900
Greetings.

194
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,400
Rise.

195
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,300
Thank you, your majesty.

196
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,100
Please enjoy the tea.

197
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,700
Consort,

198
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,300
it is late now.

199
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,400
I think Miss Song-Zhi won't be

200
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,600
coming today.

201
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,700
Please take your leave first.

202
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,400
Thank you, eunuch Su.

203
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,000
You have really good taste.

204
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,800
That helped Miss Song-Zhi to see his majesty.

205
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,100
Aren't you sleeping?

206
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,300
I promoted them Consort

207
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,900
Cao and Consort Li were close to me.

208
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,000
But I don't really

209
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,700
want to send women to his majesty.

210
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,900
You were forced to do so.

211
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,300
I badly wish for Song Zhi's return

212
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,100
to tell me that his majesty doesn't fancy her

213
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,400
and wants her to leave.

214
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,000
But it brings no advantages

215
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,300
to our plan.

216
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,100
Leave.

217
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You are a good servant.

218
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,600
I dare not forget my identity.

219
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,700
Speaking of which, I must not let you suffer.

220
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,300
Since you are with Imperial Consort Hua, I won't treat you badly.

221
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,400
You may start

222
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,500
from a higher rank.

223
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,900
Thank you, your majesty.

224
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,000
Go and give Imperical Consort Hua a kowtow. <br> She is your master after all.

225
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,600
You should be grateful that she promoted you.

226
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,200
Yes.

227
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,700
Consort, the water is warm.

228
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,900
I have put the roses in too, let me wash your face first.

229
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,600
She's back.

230
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,300
Did his majesty give you any position?

231
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,300
He gave me

232
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:34,343
a higher position because of how much he cares about you.

233
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,900
Its rare that his majesty is so nice.

234
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,800
He must have liked you very much.

235
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Having these merit

236
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,000
is all thanks to you.

237
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,100
His majesty treated me nicely because I was your servant.

238
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,600
Fine.

239
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,400
You're already someone with position.

240
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,000
Stop mocking yourself.

241
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,000
<br>

242
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,000
Where did his majesty assign your new living quarters?

243
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,300
He asked me to stay with you

244
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,600
since I am your servant.

245
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,200
Although his majesty treated me well,

246
00:17:29,232 --> 00:17:31,552
but its all because of your promotion.

247
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,800
No matter what my position is,

248
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,700
I am always your servant.

249
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Rise.

250
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,000
Since you are grateful,

251
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I will treat you as if you are my sister.

252
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:01,083
As Zhou Ning-Hai to clean the room,

253
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,000
and send 2 more people to serve you.

254
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,100
Thank you.

255
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Go and have a rest.

256
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,900
Let the others serve me.

257
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,300
I am used to serving you,

258
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,900
please let me serve you.

259
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,300
That's rare of you,

260
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,600
Su Pei-Sheng,

261
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,900
Your majesty?

262
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,600
I am going to see the Empress.

263
00:18:35,637 --> 00:18:36,592
Yes.

264
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,400
Then are you going back to Kyushu or to Imperial Consort Hua's place?

265
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,000
To Consort Hua's place.

266
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,200
Onward to the house to cool winds.

267
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Do you think that I am temperamental?

268
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:52,194
Your majesty, you are ruler.

269
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,300
You can go anywhere you wish to go.

270
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,800
It is normal.

271
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,200
I haven't been visiting Imperial Consort Hua for quite a while.

272
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,900
She has become considerate.

273
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,900
I will wait and see.

274
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
You've not been coming here for a long time.

275
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,700
I was busy,

276
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,600
you have to understand that.

277
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Take your seat.

278
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:41,000
I am happy to be able to serve you and his majesty.

279
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,200
We're sisters,

280
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,500
I feel bad to see you suffer.

281
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Just let her be.

282
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,900
I remeber that you like gold,

283
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,000
my brother sent it here.

284
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,700
It is so rare that he is not extravagant.

285
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,500
He has always said

286
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,200
that we can't waste money.

287
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,700
His position is high

288
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,700
and your majesty has high regards for his ability.

289
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,900
Therefore, there are bound to be some people who are jealous of that.

290
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Consort Hua,

291
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,100
I know what to do.

292
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,000
you've been with me for so long, you should know what can't be mentioned.

293
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:36,876
Yes.

294
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,300
Since you've finished your meal,

295
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:43,982
why don't we let Song-Zhi take a nap with you?

296
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,300
Yes, I am sleepy.

297
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,300
I will go to her room.

298
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,400
Yes.

299
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,500
Why did she

300
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,000
recommend her servant?

301
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,000
She is afraid of being dis commended again,

302
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,300
actually she started searching for a successor

303
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,300
ever since she lost Consort Li.

304
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,400
It just that she doesn't want to use girls from rich families.

305
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,153
As it might hard for her to control her in the future.

306
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,700
Thus, she chose Song-Zhi.

307
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:19,068
She's smart.

308
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:23,122
Do you think that Song-Zhi will succeed?

309
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,500
Do you want to hear the truth?

310
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Imperial Consort Hua has overdone it.

311
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,700
Why?

312
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,000
Song-Zhi is smart and pretty,

313
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:41,197
but she is too obedient.

314
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,700
Therefore, she won't succeed.

315
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,400
Imperial Consort Huan wants to use Song-Zhi to fight with you and Lady An.

316
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,500
It is not a good idea at all.

317
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,700
I never knew that Song-Zhi can go against us.

318
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,700
Imperial Consort Hua has run out of ways.

319
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
In the past,

320
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,000
she will never allow any of her pretty servants

321
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,100
to get near his majesty.

322
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,000
But now..

323
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,700
She knows that.

324
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,600
Time has changed,

325
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:11,526
Yes your father

326
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,900
leads the other to lodge a report against Nian Gengyao.

327
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,000
She is doomed.

328
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,300
Consort, his majesty has honored one of the

329
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,100
servants of Imperial Consort Hua.

330
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,000
She is suppose to start from the lowest position.

331
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,600
Why did I not hear any news of this?

332
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,300
About them,

333
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:41,934
I don't think it follows the rules.

334
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,600
The rules are set by his majesty,

335
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
This palace hasn't had a new consort for a long time.

336
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,100
Just let them be.

337
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,500
How did you comb?

338
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,500
Comb my hair properly.

339
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,400
The weather is so hot, thank goodness your highness is bringing us to a show.

340
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,200
Its the order from his majesty.

341
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,000
It is so how now, it won't be any better in the afternoon.

342
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,100
Young master hates the hot weather, I'll give you a change of clothes when we get back.

343
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,400
Greetings, Imperial Consort Hua.

344
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,300
Rise.

345
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,900
Did you know that

346
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,100
what contributed to what I have today?

347
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,600
You are a blessed person,

348
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,000
your future is unpredictable.

349
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,800
Congratulations

350
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
to you.

351
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
Save it,

352
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,000
I wouldn't dare be disrespectful to Consort Wan.

353
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,100
The more you respect me,

354
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,000
the more I hate you.

355
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,800
Aren't you humorous.

356
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,300
Do you want me to be rude to you?

357
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,000
I dare not be rude to you.

358
00:24:08,004 --> 00:24:10,359
Even if so, you have already done it.

359
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,900
I won't forget the past.

360
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,300
You are right.

361
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,000
I am willing to learn a lesson from you anytime.

362
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,100
You might want to listen,

363
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,700
but yet, I don't want to see your face at all.

364
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Don't be angry,

365
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:38,000
its not worth it for you to feel angry because of me.

366
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,400
Everybody is different,

367
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,000
it is impossible for a honorable person to be angry because of a lowly individual.

368
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,600
It will only bring advantages to those lowly people.

369
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,400
You...

370
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,100
Isn't this Song-Zhi?

371
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,800
You are right,

372
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,072
everyone is different.

373
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,800
Its too bad

374
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,500
for you to be lowly ranked.

375
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,800
I will definitely speak up for you

376
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,100
to his majesty for a higher position.

377
00:25:15,154 --> 00:25:17,441
It will bring out your identity.

378
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,500
His majesty

379
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,500
invited us to go for a show.

380
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,500
He even ordered them to perform your favorite songs.

381
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,000
Why should we speak with

382
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,400
such people under such a hot day.

383
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,200
Liu-Zhu, lets go.

384
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,500
I was worried that you weren't back from the hot weather outside.

385
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,400
I was about to send someone to look for you.

386
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,800
I was just walking around in the garden.

387
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,500
Nothing will happen.

388
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,900
It angers me so much.

389
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,400
We actually met Imperial Consort Hua and the newly favored Song-Zhi.

390
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,300
Young master suffered because of them.

391
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,100
Why?

392
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,000
His majesty likes young master now. Don't they know how to be careful?

393
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Imperial Consort Hua used to be like this.

394
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,000
But Song-Zhi, who is a servant actually dare to be mean to master.

395
00:26:30,043 --> 00:26:32,340
She is with Imperial Consort Hua,

396
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:34,447
its only natural that she helps her.

397
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,100
Young master was being too kind. We can let Imperial Consort Hua go,

398
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,900
but Song-Zhi was being too arrogant.

399
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,200
If I were young master, I would have given her a slap to the face

400
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,755
and report it to his majesty.

401
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,800
She is so mean.

402
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,100
She's my first subordinate.

403
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,800
You are being too anxious.

404
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,600
Nothing can be done like that.

405
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,300
I told you not to talk back to Imperial Consort Hua.

406
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,800
Don't even talk back to the people around her.

407
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,600
Just let them be, we still have a long way to go.

408
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,400
But Song-Zhi was so mean to you, are you just going to let it slip?

409
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,700
Huan-Bi, what do you think?

410
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,100
We should bear with it first.

411
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,400
We must do this.

412
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,500
Moreover, it is not worth it to take action on Song-Zhi.

413
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,900
Bearing with Song-Zhi doesn't mean that I am okay with such behavior from others.

414
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,900
Song-Zhi did so because she has Imperial Consort Hua backing her.

415
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,600
Do you think she has the ability for it? She is only a small servant.

416
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Do you mean...

417
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,100
We should

418
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,000
aim the master first,

419
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,600
Yes.

420
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,600
I have read these documents.

421
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,800
They are all reporting about Nian Gengyao.

422
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:07,992
I have replied to them too.

423
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,700
Yes.

424
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,900
Please punish him.

425
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,800
Nian Gengyao is arrogrant.

426
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,100
Therefore, its natural that his subordinates are unhappy with him.

427
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,000
As the emperor,

428
00:28:22,078 --> 00:28:25,322
I have to listen to the

429
00:28:25,354 --> 00:28:30,155
the words of my officers.

430
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,100
Zhen Yuan-Dao,

431
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,300
Yes.

432
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,000
You have to

433
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,000
get everyone who has power in the government to speak up.

434
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,500
Yes your majesty.

435
00:28:41,514 --> 00:28:42,728
2 days ago,

436
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,700
I asked Nian Gengyao regarding an important matter.

437
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,000
Of course,

438
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,200
I want to listen to your opinions.

439
00:28:51,245 --> 00:28:52,215
Yes.

440
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,900
My 8th and 9th brother

441
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,100
have been imprisoned in the Clan Court for quite some time.

442
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,000
I hear that not only have they not reflected on their wrong doings,

443
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,600
instead, they accused me and my father.

444
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,000
What do you think I should do?

445
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,944
They went into collision secretly,

446
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:18,987
they deserve the punishment for not reflecting on their wrong doings.

447
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,600
What does uncle think of this?

448
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,500
Although they are guilty,

449
00:29:26,526 --> 00:29:29,994
but they are still our family.

450
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
How about sending some elders from our family to teach them.

451
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,500
Zhen Yuan-Dao,

452
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,900
I think that we can't be easy on them simply because they are our family.

453
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,100
<br>

454
00:29:47,112 --> 00:29:50,310
Perhaps, they are not reflecting on their wrong doings because of their relationship with us.

455
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:54,504
<br>

456
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,000
You are right.

457
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,600
I will think about it.

458
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,800
Your majesty has asked about the actions to be taken on his brothers.

459
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,700
What are your opinons?

460
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,400
The general has been complaining recently,

461
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:22,034
and yet his majesty...

462
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,800
But his majesty rewarded those who made the complain.

463
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,000
I think General is unhappy about it,

464
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,315
but he can't offend his majesty now.

465
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,600
Therefore he can't,

466
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,700
simply give an answer to his majesty.

467
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:38,585
Yes.

468
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,100
If his majesty shows no mercy to his brothers,

469
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
he will do the same to brother too,

470
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,500
When I am maligned in the future.

471
00:30:50,562 --> 00:30:52,562
You are imagining things.

472
00:30:52,577 --> 00:30:55,224
His majesty would not do such a thing to general.

473
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,200
Many people are complaining about my brother,

474
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,800
even his followers want to rebel against him.

475
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,000
What does his majesty want posing such a question to my brother?

476
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,400
What does he mean?

477
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,800
Perhaps...

478
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,000
Perhaps his majesty just wanted opinions.

479
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,300
No,

480
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,000
his majesty is not like this.

481
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,500
He has always been biased to brother.

482
00:31:24,504 --> 00:31:27,032
But now he is starting to desolate him.

483
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,500
The Nian family has always been loyal to the royal family.

484
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,300
Yes.

485
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,500
His majesty must have been suborned by rumors.

486
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,600
He is concerned.

487
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,100
If you think that it might affect you, you can get

488
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,400
general to behave in front of his majesty, and try to move his majesty.

489
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,100
His majesty must be reminded

490
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,000
of the contributions that General has contributed to the country.

491
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,900
But my brother tried to fight for the crown with his majesty.

492
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:01,035
<br>

493
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,900
His majesty hates them the most.

494
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,300
Is it ok for me to answer to him like this?

495
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,900
Of course we can't let General to advice his majesty to release them,

496
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,500
but he may mention their brotherly love.

497
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:25,041
And show his loyalty.

498
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,700
Well, there's no harm in doing so.

499
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,600
It is only a moderate way.

500
00:32:39,943 --> 00:32:42,834
His majesty is a soft-hearted person.

501
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,900
He must treat everyone the same way.

502
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,600
You sure are relaxed.

503
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Greetings your majesty.

504
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,800
I have nothing to do.

505
00:33:25,823 --> 00:33:27,857
Have you finished meeting with the officers?

506
00:33:29,459 --> 00:33:31,759
Were you here just now?

507
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,200
Was it regarding General Nian?

508
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,500
Its regarding you.

509
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,000
Of course, I knew that you've done your best to tolerate.

510
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
You won't believe me, right?

511
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,100
Yes.

512
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:56,100
Imperial Consort Hua told me that you were disrespectful to her even though she bought Song-Zhi to argue with you.

513
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,700
She is stubborn.

514
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,800
Then what is your plan?

515
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I don't want this to happen too.

516
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,400
I don't want you to be bothered by these things.

517
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:32,300
I just want to tell you that I can no longer tolerate Nian Gengyao anymore.

518
00:34:33,246 --> 00:34:37,027
You are the ruler, there is nothing you can't do.

519
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,700
Since the blade has been in your heart for so long,

520
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:41,505
its time to remove it.

521
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,900
The reason why I tolerated him till now is just so that it will be easier for me to remove it.

522
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,800
Would you do so if it was you?

523
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,000
I understand.

524
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,100
Good,

525
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,900
its still early, I'll be going back first.

526
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,400
You may rest.

527
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,600
Goodbye, your majesty.

528
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,300
I will be organizing a feast at Kyushu inn tomorrow,

529
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,800
be there early.

530
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,100
Yes.

531
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,100
Consort,

532
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,900
his majesty too Song-Zhi's card again.

533
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,200
Take your leave first.

534
00:35:25,227 --> 00:35:26,244
Yes.

535
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,400
Did you hear that?

536
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,300
His majesty went to see Song-Zhi again.

537
00:35:31,315 --> 00:35:33,314
He has been so lately.

538
00:35:33,346 --> 00:35:37,318
She is his majesty's new love.

539
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,100
Who does she think she is?

540
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,600
She was still a low servant yesterday.

541
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,900
But now, she has climbed onto his majesty's bed.

542
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,300
I don't want her to dirty the beds of Kyushu.

543
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Sister Wan is straight forward.

544
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,200
But you can't speak like that to outsiders.

545
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,900
This is a fact. I am not afraid of other people spreading it.

546
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,600
I must make her desolated.

547
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,600
Your majesty, I hear that you been disliking General Nian these days.

548
00:36:15,622 --> 00:36:17,991
And always scolding him.

549
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,900
Who told about it?

550
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,200
I dare not utter nonsense,

551
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:29,100
I heard this from Imperial Consort Hua.

552
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,600
What did they say?

553
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:36,360
Did they say that I wronged him?

554
00:36:36,378 --> 00:36:37,867
No.

555
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:42,300
They said that General Nian did not behave properly and angered you.

556
00:36:42,344 --> 00:36:46,475
I am angry is because I have high regard for his abilities.

557
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,500
I wanted him to settle everything for me,

558
00:36:49,544 --> 00:36:52,986
and not let other people get a hold of him.

559
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,200
So you did not desolate him.

560
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,700
I love you and Imperial Consort Hua,

561
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,100
Nian Gengyao has contributed well to the society.

562
00:37:03,107 --> 00:37:05,335
Moreover, I am his brother-in-law.

563
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Imperial Consort Hua has been

564
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,700
serving me for many years and nurturing you.

565
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,700
I know what to do.

566
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,400
Your majesty.

567
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,400
My brother has followed my instructions and sent the document to his majesty.

568
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,290
His majesty said nothing.

569
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,400
But he has stopped accusing brother.

570
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:36,710
That's great, I can stop worrying too.

571
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,300
You know nothing.

572
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,200
I know how his majesty accused brother everyday.

573
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,000
It is really terrifying.

574
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,300
Luckily Song-Zhi knew that his majesty thinks

575
00:37:50,366 --> 00:37:53,830
from his tone of voice,

576
00:37:53,984 --> 00:37:56,918
that he thinks brother has done well for the society.

577
00:37:56,937 --> 00:37:58,044
Yes.

578
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
I am assured too.

579
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,000
His majesty was just acting

580
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:07,200
in order to satisfy those despicable men.

581
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,400
How would he truly accuse the general?

582
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,800
Your idea really did worked.

583
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:19,072
As long as his majesty cares more about you, I am happy.

584
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,100
<br>

585
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:22,598
Good.

586
00:38:22,652 --> 00:38:26,056
I will be good to you too

587
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,400
as long as his majesty treats me and my brother well.

588
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,500
I will let his majesty

589
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,800
honor you as consort soon.

590
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:42,322
Empress, Consort Song-Zhi is back.

591
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,400
She wants to give her greetings to you.

592
00:38:46,045 --> 00:38:48,982
Ask her to go and rest.

593
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,800
Yes.

594
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:50,880
Wait a minute,

595
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,500
don't forget to bring some ginseng soup for her.

596
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,400
Yes.

597
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,300
Song-Zhi slept with his majesty again.

598
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,100
Your lesson is really good. She is new favor now.

599
00:39:12,111 --> 00:39:14,305
It is her fate.

600
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:16,777
I trained you too.

601
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:18,627
But you don't seem to be getting the same treatment.

602
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,200
But recently,

603
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,100
I've heard some rumors

604
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,700
that Consort Wan isn't happy about Song-Zhi.

605
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,400
I've heard these from his majesty too.

606
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,300
No wonder his majesty

607
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,400
didn't visit her recently.

608
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,356
Why would his majesty

609
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,700
listen to Consort Wan's words of jealousy?

610
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,700
<br>

611
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,700
I will let her get what she wants.
