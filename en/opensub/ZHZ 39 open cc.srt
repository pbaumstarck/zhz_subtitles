1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,775
Episode 39

2
00:00:05,462 --> 00:00:08,835
Look at the document sent by Nian Gengyao.

3
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,394
Nian Gengyao has requested His Majesty to consider his brotherhood.

4
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:32,397
It doesn't look the same on the outside.

5
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,841
You have to be able to know the hidden meaning behind it.

6
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:40,934
You are now testing me.

7
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:45,676
Nian Gengyao is actually trying to use the brotherhood as his reason

8
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:50,225
and trying to find a way out for himself.

9
00:00:51,105 --> 00:00:53,464
He is smart enough.

10
00:00:54,376 --> 00:01:00,968
If I can forgive the rebellion of Yun-Si and Yun-Tang,

11
00:01:01,372 --> 00:01:04,132
then I can forgive the discretion of Nian Gengyao.

12
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:06,024
<br>

13
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,463
His words are just the same

14
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:11,258
as said by Long Kodo.

15
00:01:11,258 --> 00:01:15,456
Nian Gengyao and Long Kodo

16
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:18,643
are my helpful officers.

17
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:23,591
Even they were fooled by Yun-Si,

18
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:29,188
and pleaded for him, I'm very disappointed

19
00:01:29,972 --> 00:01:32,651
in the both of them.

20
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:35,515
Before the titles of Yun-Si and Yun-Tang were taken away,

21
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:37,569
they were very close to Lord Dun.

22
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:42,638
So he's the one that you should be mad at, Your Majesty.

23
00:01:42,638 --> 00:01:45,775
Now even Nian Gengyao is the same,

24
00:01:45,775 --> 00:01:47,682
and he has military power too.

25
00:01:47,682 --> 00:01:51,090
I think he's being controlled by Lord Dun.

26
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,166
It will be a grave matter.

27
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:56,512
I guess your worries will become reality soon.

28
00:01:57,104 --> 00:01:59,972
I've know the conspiracy between Nian Gengyao and Lord Dun since the beginning.

29
00:01:59,972 --> 00:02:02,164
It was not something done in a day or two.

30
00:02:02,534 --> 00:02:06,737
You thought that Nian Gengyao is just a greedy and cruel person

31
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:12,062
But he is no different from those other rebellious officers.

32
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:16,556
I think that it's better to cut off their contact from each other.

33
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:23,192
You must eliminate Lord Dun first, before getting rid of Nian Gengyao.

34
00:02:24,305 --> 00:02:26,462
There will be a lot of trouble

35
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:30,781
coming from the inner palace.

36
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,418
I must settle the matters of the inner palace first,

37
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:38,143
before I can concentrate with state affairs

38
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:41,640
Brother Zhen.

39
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,910
I feel that there is something wrong with His Majesty's words.

40
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,681
You are being too humble, be honest with me

41
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:50,458
I have only been here to see His Majesty twice,

42
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,448
so I don't understand what His Majesty meant.

43
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:56,036
Imperial Concubine Wan is most favored by His Majesty,

44
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:59,307
and would like to send you a message.

45
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:01,302
Do tell.

46
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:06,812
His Majesty mentioned Nian Gengyao and Long Kodo together today.

47
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:10,692
Maybe Nian Gengyao is not the only one that His Majesty wants to eliminate.

48
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:12,778
His Majesty is wise in his own way.

49
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:15,351
It is not something that we can fully understand.

50
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:19,620
Those that have followed His Majesty for a long time,

51
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:22,870
will naturally know what His Majesty is actually talking about.

52
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,607
There is another thing I noticed,

53
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,738
His Majesty wants the issues of the inner palace to be resolved

54
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:32,796
before the state affairs.

55
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:35,300
This might be due to his

56
00:03:36,554 --> 00:03:40,208
promises to balance out everything

57
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,014
In the inner palace,

58
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,929
His Majesty needs to be aware of the situation.

59
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,200
Since all my sisters are present today

60
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:56,673
I would like to toast Your Majesty and Empress,

61
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,700
May you both always stay healthy.

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,900
Your Majesty, I know that drinking is no good for your health,

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,800
so I've sincerely prepared a plate of fruits

64
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,900
for Your Majesty to taste.

65
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,100
Not bad.

66
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,500
Song-Zhi Meimei, are these fruits really sincerely chosen for His Majesty?

67
00:04:51,556 --> 00:04:53,796
He did not praise you for that,

68
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,100
looks like you have to pay more attention to what His Majesty likes.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,600
Yes, you are right.

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,900
I've only been here for a couple of months

71
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,656
please do guide me along if I make any mistakes.

72
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,200
Although I don't know what His Majesty likes but

73
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,000
I do put in my best effort for all matters related to His Majesty.

74
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,400
All I think about is for you, Your Majesty.

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
I hope Your Majesty knows how I feel.

76
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,100
Yes I do know.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,900
With me here,

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,300
no one will dare speak of you badly.

79
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,400
Your Majesty likes Wan Meimei

80
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,500
it's rare that he will speak up for you.

81
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,800
Looks like Your Majesty really appreciates you, Song-zhi Meimei

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,600
You are right, Song-zhi Meimei,

83
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,800
we all have to learn little by little what His Majesty likes.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,600
So you expect His Majesty to be satisfied with empty passion?

85
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,396
But you really have to buck up

86
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,700
it's already July,

87
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,400
His Majesty has to leave in August,

88
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,400
for the once in three years beauty pageant be during mid-autumn.

89
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,000
And when the new ladies arrive, that's when you will have your hands full.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I can't be as busy as you

91
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,400
Imperial Concubine Wan is older and is doted on by His Majesty

92
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,000
I think you can handle everything well while teaching everyone else.

93
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,300
At the same time,

94
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,100
you are not just hardworking but you're good at observing

95
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,200
that's why Imperial Consort Hua likes you

96
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,300
and sends you to His Majesty often. All these are what I'm not capable of.

97
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Imperial Concubine Wan is going too far

98
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,100
Your Majesty, are you going to just let her be?

99
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,700
Empress, what is your opinion?

100
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,500
With so many women around, bickering is unavoidable

101
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,300
I think they've drunk too much and didn't mean what they said

102
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,000
I will talk to them about this later on.

103
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,500
Is this how Empress takes care of the inner palace for me?

104
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:33,200
No wonder there has been so many problems in the inner palace.

105
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,200
Don't be angry, it is all my fault.

106
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,300
Do you know what you have done wrong?

107
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,500
Aren't you useless if you

108
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,200
can't even handle this small fight. It just shows how incapable you are.

109
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,600
Yes I know I'm guilty, please don't be angry Your Majesty.

110
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,400
Imperial Concubine Wan!

111
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,300
Yes

112
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:04,510
Go

113
00:08:06,628 --> 00:08:07,710
Your Majesty?

114
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,800
Your Majesty means...

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,200
His Majesty is fair and just, he has never been biased.

116
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:24,632
Imperial Concubine Wan did not choose her words wisely

117
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:30,224
she will be sent to Penglai Island to reflect on her mistakes tomorrow

118
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,200
and may not leave the island until further notice.

119
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,400
Your Majesty, Penglai Island is such a deserted place only reachable by boats, not to mention how far away it is

120
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:51,300
and there hasn't been anyone living there. Seeing how it's Jiejie's first mistake, please forgive her.

121
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,200
Your Majesty, I've been here for 3 years

122
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:02,000
I know I have said the wrong words but please reconsider your decision

123
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,500
and forgive me this once. I will never do it again.

124
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,200
Weren't you all proud and arrogant when you spoke to Song-zhi just now?

125
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:16,600
If you could do this in front of me, I can't imagine how you are like behind my back.

126
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,100
I didn't speak those words on purpose.

127
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,900
I have doted on Song-zhi during this time,

128
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,800
so you have been making things difficult for her

129
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,400
and talking about her behind her back.

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,600
How can I forgive you?

131
00:09:32,602 --> 00:09:33,756
I did not.

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Your Majesty knows

133
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,600
I've always been straightforward

134
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
but I really didn't mean it.

135
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,500
Your Majesty, seeing as how it's her first mistake

136
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,200
why don't you just forgive her?

137
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,500
Penglai Island is too deserted and far.

138
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,900
His Majesty has already made his stand

139
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,500
do you still dare to challenge him?

140
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,400
Consort Jing,

141
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Consort Jing, would you like to accompany her as well?

142
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,000
Ah.

143
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,900
It's must be hard on Zhi.

144
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
I will console her myself.

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,200
Su Pei-sheng.

146
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,400
Yes.

147
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,300
Imperial Concubine Wan, please rise

148
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,000
I will get some people

149
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:30,021
to send you to Penglai Island.

150
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,000
Imperial Concubine Wan, do take care.

151
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,800
I will take my leave now.

152
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,000
Although I am inadept

153
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:47,561
but I will help you take good care of His Majesty.

154
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,200
Please take care.

155
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,100
Good evening, Empress.

156
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,000
Go ahead.

157
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,600
Thank you, Empress.

158
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,200
Why did you ask me here in such a hurry?

159
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:10,797
Is anything the matter?

160
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
I feel that what happened tonight

161
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,300
is strange and

162
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:17,584
I can't stop worrying about it.

163
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,300
Yes, I agree as well.

164
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,700
No matter how much His Majesty likes Song-zhi

165
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,900
he needn't to go to the extent of getting angry with Wan.

166
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:32,236
Imperial Concubine Wan's father is the biggest critic of Nian Gengyao.

167
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,600
Is His Majesty using Song-zhi to protect Lady Hua?

168
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,700
Has His Majesty changed his mind

169
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,600
is protecting Nian Gengyao the reason for this?

170
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,600
If this is really the case

171
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:50,472
doesn't it mean that Imperial Concubinet Wan can't be saved.

172
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,600
If Imperial Concubine Wan is not the favorite, Zhen Yuan-dao will have no support at all.

173
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,300
And nobody will be able to defeat Nian Gengyao.

174
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,900
I refuse to let this happen.

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,100
What are you planning to do?

176
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Although Nian Gengyao has been criticized,

177
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,600
thus getting scolded by His Majesty

178
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,700
but he was never really punished before.

179
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,700
Lady Hua has power in the inner palace

180
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,300
after Imperial Concubine Wan leaves, you'll be her next target.

181
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,600
Why don't you accompany Imperial Concubine Wan, and observe from afar?

182
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,700
What do you think?

183
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,800
Er...

184
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,600
If Imperial Cocubine Wan doesn't even come back

185
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,900
won't have to stay there forever with her?

186
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,500
Don't worry,

187
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:44,026
by then even if you want to stay of your own accord

188
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,200
I will still make you leave.

189
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,200
For this matter

190
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,100
I keep feeling that

191
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,300
it would be better

192
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,600
if you accompanied Imperial Concubine Wan.

193
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,400
Yes,

194
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,900
I will go with her then.

195
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,300
Jiejie!

196
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,200
Are you here to send me off?

197
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,600
I have already informed His Majesty

198
00:13:28,077 --> 00:13:30,157
that I will stay with you in Penglai Island.

199
00:13:30,197 --> 00:13:31,517
What are you saying?

200
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:33,717
I will stay with you in Penglai Island.

201
00:13:33,797 --> 00:13:35,957
His Majesty has already given his approval.

202
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,700
So I'm not here to send you off.

203
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,600
Don't speak nonsense

204
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,700
do you really think

205
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,600
we're going there to be goddesses?

206
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,200
If you leave with me

207
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,700
your future in the palace will be ruined.

208
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,400
Why would you want live such a hard life with me?

209
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,900
Jiejie, I know it very well

210
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,200
that since I received this title,

211
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,900
I have offended a lot of people.

212
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,200
Only you treated me differently.

213
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:06,994
Now that you're leaving

214
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,394
rather than stay in the palace and be sneered at

215
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
and ignored

216
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,300
why not follow you there?

217
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,100
We can take care

218
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,700
and look out for each other.

219
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,100
Congratulations

220
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,200
you have eliminated another enemy.

221
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,500
She's only leaving for Penglai Island

222
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,000
you never know if she will come back.

223
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,871
With Song-zhi Meimeihere,

224
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,679
what do you have to be afraid of?

225
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,700
At the right moment

226
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,700
you just to utter a few more words,

227
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,400
which would be more than enough.

228
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,100
These are all not important

229
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,400
what matters is that His Majesty scolded Imperial ConcubineWan

230
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,400
teaching Zhen Yuan-dao a lesson.

231
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:50,079
I feel more relaxed now.

232
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,200
Precious An

233
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,600
even left with her.

234
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
The Empress' authority has been weakened.

235
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,300
Girls like An Ling-rong have no strong family backing

236
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,700
even if she sings herself hoarse, she is just someone who can sing.

237
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,600
She's just lucky that His Majesty dotes on her

238
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,800
but her luck is not going to last forever.

239
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,700
I have to say

240
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,200
you're really planned it out well

241
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,100
this time.

242
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,000
Now that Zhi is His Majesty's favorite,

243
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,800
of my effort would have gone down the drain.

244
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,800
Zhi has truly gained His Majesty's favour

245
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,800
it'll be even better if you can get the title of Chang Zai.

246
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,200
Yes, if you get pregnant

247
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,600
your position will be same as mine then.

248
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,462
Honoured Lady Cao please don't speak so highly of me

249
00:15:47,507 --> 00:15:50,056
no matter what titles I receive, I am still your slave

250
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:52,515
I will never dare forget that.

251
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,944
Glad you know that.

252
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:01,068
Let's go.

253
00:16:06,277 --> 00:16:08,801
There's only one way to Penglai Island

254
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:13,544
once the boat leaves you're stranded here and won't be able to leave the island.

255
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,587
I'm grateful that His Majesty has assigned me to such a peaceful place.

256
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,914
Although it can't be compared to Shu Yuan but it's not too run down

257
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:51,113
I initially believed that Penglai Island has lost all its lustre

258
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:54,580
but it looks clean and nice.

259
00:16:55,665 --> 00:17:00,036
Although His Majesty sides Lady Hua but he would never treat you badly.

260
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:05,614
This place has been tidied up so well, I know that you must have done a lot.

261
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:08,595
Thank you very much. <br> You've always

262
00:17:08,665 --> 00:17:12,067
taken care and looked out for me

263
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,108
now that you're here, I just wanted to show my gratitude.

264
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:19,509
I hope I have the chance to serve you in future.

265
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:25,874
Look, you've always treated others well and others are now reciprocating.

266
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:29,095
Even I get to enjoy the benefits of this.

267
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:32,875
I can't stay for long

268
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:36,708
in future I will get someone to send supplies to the island.

269
00:17:36,774 --> 00:17:41,197
It's getting back, do rest early.

270
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:44,076
Thank you Gonggong.

271
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:55,345
Don't be dejected, His Majesty is just momentarily fooled by Lady Hua.

272
00:17:55,345 --> 00:17:59,074
He still loves you deeply.

273
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:02,530
Who knows, one day he'll get someone to escort you back.

274
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:07,386
Don't worry about me, I feel bad for implicating you.

275
00:18:07,408 --> 00:18:11,554
Why did you only bring along Bao-juan? What about Ju-qing?

276
00:18:11,596 --> 00:18:15,146
Bao-juan has served me for the longest time

277
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:19,005
I'm used to having her around. Ju-qing was given to me by you

278
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:22,989
I'm can't bear to bring her along. Let her guard the House of Free Moon for me.

279
00:18:22,989 --> 00:18:27,956
But don't worry Jiejie, I know some sewing skills

280
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:31,312
we can do everything ourselves.

281
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,694
Sorry to trouble you.

282
00:18:35,624 --> 00:18:38,264
Consorts, Jing is here.

283
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:44,543
Greetings Empress, Wan has already left for Penglai Island.

284
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:47,264
Stand.

285
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:50,933
We can't even send her off

286
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:55,266
only Honoured Lady An is loyal and went along with her.

287
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:59,146
That's good too, with Lady Hua getting powerful

288
00:18:59,195 --> 00:19:02,583
they should go as far away as they can.

289
00:19:02,637 --> 00:19:05,795
Out of sight, out of mind

290
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:10,699
it's harder for us here, always having to be wary of others.

291
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:16,114
How do you expect us to feel if you say that

292
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:19,165
this palace needs you.

293
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:25,952
What else can I do? With Lady Hua lording over me.

294
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:30,705
That might not be the case, although His Majesty favours Lady Hua and Zhi

295
00:19:31,524 --> 00:19:35,015
but he hasn't made any decision on Nian Gengyao's issue.

296
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:40,306
Why do you have to be afraid of you, you're the leader of the inner palace and we all obey you

297
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:43,382
she can't do anything on her own.

298
00:19:45,543 --> 00:19:48,909
Yes I know and lucky I still have you all.

299
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:52,538
Wan and Honoured Lady An have both left

300
00:19:53,186 --> 00:19:57,895
if we don't stick together, I fear we'll

301
00:19:57,895 --> 00:20:00,465
be the ones going to Penglai Island next.

302
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:03,746
We see you as our leader.

303
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:06,635
We see you as our leader.

304
00:20:07,324 --> 00:20:10,864
That's enough, please stand.

305
00:20:11,985 --> 00:20:14,045
Thank you NiangNiang.

306
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,047
Zhou Ning-hai offers his greetings to the Empress.

307
00:20:22,384 --> 00:20:26,424
Lady Hua will be dining with His Majesty, so

308
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:28,895
she won't be able to offer her greetings today.

309
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:32,349
She hopes you can forgive her.

310
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:35,550
She's not coming but how about Zhi?

311
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:39,304
Zhi will be joining them, so she won't be able to make it as well.

312
00:20:40,086 --> 00:20:43,253
Empress, you won't get mad over such a small matter,

313
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:47,186
right?

314
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,572
If this is a small matter,

315
00:20:50,572 --> 00:20:53,621
what is considered a big issue then?<br> Forget it

316
00:20:53,677 --> 00:20:57,437
Lady Xin, issues pertaining to His Majesty are big matters.

317
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:01,985
Zhou Ning-hai you may take your leave.

318
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,540
Thank you Empress, I will leave now.

319
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:20,245
It's almost winter time, His Majesty should be back soon right?

320
00:21:20,985 --> 00:21:24,065
Yes I heard it's the beginning of next month.

321
00:21:25,154 --> 00:21:27,755
Then Consort Jing will be back soon too.

322
00:21:28,402 --> 00:21:32,741
Consort Jing will be back soon, but not Concubine Wan.

323
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:36,199
What?<br> I didn't dare inform you

324
00:21:36,226 --> 00:21:40,228
that Imperial Concubine Wan incurred the wrath of His Majesty and was banished to Penglai Island.

325
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:44,473
Penglai Island is worse than the cold palace (where disfavored queen or concubine was placed)

326
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:47,784
it's like being in jail. <br> Yes

327
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:50,585
His Majesty will be back soon

328
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:53,063
yet no one is cleaning the House of Broken Jade

329
00:21:53,121 --> 00:21:55,874
I don't think she can come back this time.

330
00:21:55,911 --> 00:22:00,167
Consort Wan is alone without anything

331
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,995
how pitiful.

332
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,500
We don't even know what's happening now.

333
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,500
Why don't we get someone to send some things over?

334
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,200
She was so favoured before, what does she lack?

335
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,100
Don't waste your effort.

336
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,200
Are you thinking of His Majesty?

337
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,100
No I'm thinking of myself.

338
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,000
Maybe His Majesty has already forgotten about us.

339
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,800
How would we even know that?

340
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,043
Don't be sad.

341
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,400
I cooked you fish taufu.

342
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,110
Please come in.

343
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,400
You go ahead. I will be there in a minute.

344
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,400
Quick.

345
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,600
Eunuch Su is here to see you.

346
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,200
It's almost winter now.

347
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,600
You didn't bring enough clothes.

348
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,000
Lady Hui asked to bring a few clothes from the palace.

349
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,000
She still remembers me.

350
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,800
Lady Hui is actually very concerned about you.

351
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,000
These are for the Honoured Lady An.

352
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,200
but she prepared two sets. How can she forget you?

353
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,100
Your Majesty asked about you.

354
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm fine thank you.

355
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,800
Yes.

356
00:24:22,824 --> 00:24:24,075
What about Your Majesty?

357
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,000
He's fine as well.

358
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:26,697
Everything's fine?

359
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Everything's fine. Don't worry.

360
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,100
Great then.

361
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,000
I came here this time is to inform you that

362
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Your Majesty is returning.

363
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,900
We don't know what the condition is.

364
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,400
Please take good care of Your Majesty.

365
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,700
Yes.

366
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,300
Yes I have to go tomorrow.

367
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,100
I have a smart student. He will

368
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,536
send your things to you.

369
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,100
If anything happens in Capital,

370
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,236
please send someone to inform me.

371
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,000
Your Majesty is worried that you might be the first to get hurt.

372
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,000
So he sends you away for good.

373
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,900
Yes, I will pray for his safety as well.

374
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,829
I can't stay very long.

375
00:25:14,835 --> 00:25:16,504
I have to go now.

376
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Yes

377
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,400
You've returned.

378
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,800
Your Majesty, I got this

379
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,100
mail from middle.

380
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,800
This mail is from the messenger of Lord Dun.

381
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,100
He's trying to persuade Nian

382
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,300
Gengyao to help him and

383
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,900
let Yun-Si be the emperor.

384
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:59,014
Mother to Yun-Si as Empress.

385
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,300
I can't let them succeed,

386
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,022
else it will be a disaster for us.

387
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,800
Come

388
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
Your Majesty

389
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,400
Order your assassins to

390
00:26:14,437 --> 00:26:17,312
guard Lord Dun for me.

391
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,400
I will send a troop of army

392
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:23,233
to capture everyone.

393
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,900
Thank you for your help.

394
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,800
I just tried my best to help.

395
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,200
You are the only one who can be around Lord Dun

396
00:26:34,233 --> 00:26:36,875
without raising suspicion.

397
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:41,033
Help me guard his house tonight.

398
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:44,236
Report immediately if anything happens.

399
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,112
Yes.

400
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,700
Su Pei Sheng.

401
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,400
Yes.

402
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,200
Tell Empress

403
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,000
that she is not feeling well tonight,

404
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,900
so she needs Lord Dun's wife and son

405
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,600
to serve by her side.

406
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,552
Yes.

407
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,500
Empress had already reminded me regarding that matter.

408
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,200
Your Majesty had already returned for almost a month.

409
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,500
It's almost winter time now.

410
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
What happened?

411
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,500
My hand is getting tired from holding the book.

412
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,000
No wonder, you are reading the

413
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:42,796
You must be afraid.

414
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,000
Yes, I am afraid.

415
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,600
The fight between the brothers,

416
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,900
there will always be a losing side.

417
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,200
This is a matter of life and death.

418
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,000
Those are the men's pride.

419
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,200
As for us, Your Majesty is the one who

420
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,100
gives up pride and honor.

421
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,800
We might not be able to share his glory,

422
00:28:08,822 --> 00:28:12,994
but when he is humiliated, we will definitely be humiliated too.

423
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,600
You just can't let go of him, don't you?

424
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It is not that I can't let go,

425
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,300
but after all these years, other than life and wealth,

426
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,900
there must be something that you can't let go.

427
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,500
He is the only man

428
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,100
in my whole life.

429
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,400
Yes.

430
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,900
Recently, you always seem worried,

431
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
is there anything bothering you?

432
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,500
After this light, no matter

433
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,700
what you worries are, they will be settled.

434
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,200
Look, this lady has been sleeping

435
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,900
I just made some food, please eat it while it's still hot.

436
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,600
It's been a long time since I last had taro.

437
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,700
I always had it at home.

438
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,000
Smells nice.

439
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:11,276
Eat it.

440
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,800
Your Majesty.

441
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,700
How was it?

442
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,900
Everything is under control.

443
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,700
We have captured Lord Dun.

444
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,500
When my father was still alive,

445
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,700
Yun Si, Yun Tang and Yun Er tried to

446
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,700
seize the throne.

447
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,100
They have gone too far.

448
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:54,767
So their title had been taken away.

449
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,900
However, because of Imperial Consort Xi,

450
00:29:57,916 --> 00:30:02,004
they got their title back.

451
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,079
In order to calm him,

452
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,300
I gave him the Duke title.

453
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
But he is too greedy.

454
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:09,557
Yes.

455
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Thank you for your help.

456
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,700
I never wanted to let you see this,

457
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,000
but thank you for your help.

458
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,900
There are still a lot of rebels,

459
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,700
but I hope that Yun will be the last

460
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,100
I hope that the others will just obey.

461
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,400
I can't say for others,

462
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,900
but I am just an ordinary person.

463
00:30:46,954 --> 00:30:49,030
I just wanted to keep my position,

464
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,800
I do not wish to be involved in such dangerous matters in the future.

465
00:30:53,824 --> 00:30:55,747
Since you have already said that,

466
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,100
how can I say no to you?

467
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,100
Thank you.

468
00:31:14,574 --> 00:31:17,383
Honoured Lady An has not woke up yet?

469
00:31:17,424 --> 00:31:19,787
Yes, she stayed up late sewing last night.

470
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:26,065
Look.

471
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,226
What are you doing?

472
00:31:43,304 --> 00:31:45,966
Your Majesty told me that nothing is guaranteed,

473
00:31:45,994 --> 00:31:48,821
so I have to protect myself.

474
00:31:48,862 --> 00:31:51,636
I've promised Your Majesty that

475
00:31:51,664 --> 00:31:54,283
if anything happens, I will not live alone.

476
00:31:54,304 --> 00:31:57,104
Consort.

477
00:32:02,064 --> 00:32:05,103
If Your Majesty failed,

478
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:07,864
I can't protect myself either.

479
00:32:07,898 --> 00:32:10,418
Rather than being tortured, I rather die.

480
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:32,227
Is Your Majesty safe?

481
00:32:32,273 --> 00:32:35,223
Yes, he is safe and healthy.

482
00:32:39,902 --> 00:32:41,863
Consort

483
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:47,246
Consort, please do not cry. This is

484
00:32:47,272 --> 00:32:50,864
Your Majesty order me to send you and

485
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,883
During these few months,

486
00:33:04,907 --> 00:33:08,103
you've lost some weight.

487
00:33:09,131 --> 00:33:13,464
I've been worried about you

488
00:33:14,545 --> 00:33:16,612
Me too.

489
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:20,331
So I rushed here immediately once I know you are back.

490
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,180
when she knew that

491
00:33:31,223 --> 00:33:34,114
you will be sent to Penglai Island.

492
00:33:34,143 --> 00:33:38,783
It is really hard to find such a great friend.

493
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,578
Yes, she is

494
00:33:43,302 --> 00:33:46,632
but I do not dare to tell her the truth.

495
00:33:46,668 --> 00:33:49,547
It's for her own good.

496
00:33:50,427 --> 00:33:53,104
Your Majesty, are you alright?

497
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:57,226
You have been asking this question ever since you returned.

498
00:33:58,188 --> 00:34:01,462
Really? I did not realise that.

499
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:06,188
Everything is over now.

500
00:34:16,963 --> 00:34:21,343
Yun Si will be renamed as Akina

501
00:34:21,995 --> 00:34:24,543
Akina Saisihei?

502
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,262
It means pig and dog in our language.

503
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:33,874
They tried to rebel, giving them such names

504
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:36,952
is an insult to the animals.

505
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:40,691
Your Majesty captured Lord Dun.

506
00:34:40,691 --> 00:34:43,187
This is all heaven's will for everything to go well.

507
00:34:43,613 --> 00:34:46,693
I would like to tell you another thing.

508
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:50,673
Before he tried to rebel, he once requested

509
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:54,271
army from Nian Gengyao, but this letter

510
00:34:54,271 --> 00:34:57,049
had been intercepted by Guo Jun Wang.

511
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:06,941
I don't think he really wants to rebel.

512
00:35:06,983 --> 00:35:10,492
He just can't give up his wealth. If he really does that,

513
00:35:10,492 --> 00:35:13,543
he would get less than what he owns now.

514
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:17,062
Nian Gengyao is unsatisfied with me...

515
00:35:17,062 --> 00:35:21,103
but he will still consider about Lady Hua.

516
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:25,498
I am just curious,

517
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:29,224
why did Lord Dun seek Nian Gengyao instead of others?

518
00:35:33,455 --> 00:35:36,291
Let me think about that.

519
00:35:38,022 --> 00:35:42,070
I don't care about what other thinks,

520
00:35:42,113 --> 00:35:46,553
all I know is that you have suffered

521
00:35:47,426 --> 00:35:50,919
To be honest, I am not willing to send you to Penglai Island.

522
00:35:52,057 --> 00:35:55,423
I am worried that you will be hurt if you remained here.

523
00:35:56,344 --> 00:35:58,992
Without you here,

524
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:02,343
Nian Gengyao and Lady Hua will be less cautious.

525
00:36:02,938 --> 00:36:06,684
Yes, I understand. This is nothing

526
00:36:07,313 --> 00:36:10,032
compared to Your Majesty.

527
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:15,104
You are the one who understands me best.

528
00:36:19,024 --> 00:36:23,866
Greeting, Empress.

529
00:36:24,784 --> 00:36:28,023
Come back in the morning if you are just here to greet me.

530
00:36:28,643 --> 00:36:31,944
You must be exhausted from

531
00:36:31,985 --> 00:36:34,873
Thank you, Empress.<br>If I don't visit you, I won't be able to sleep well tonight.

532
00:36:34,885 --> 00:36:36,978
Please rise.

533
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:41,304
Did you complain anything

534
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:44,425
to Wan on the way back?

535
00:36:44,486 --> 00:36:47,023
No, I would not dare to speak much.

536
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:54,787
Good to hear that. She will not easily tell you what Your Majesty told her.

537
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:01,105
and she will be praised for keeping secrets.

538
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:03,656
It will be better for you

539
00:37:06,946 --> 00:37:09,581
Your Majesty had a great impression of you

540
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:12,267
for accompanying her.

541
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:15,546
If not for your advise,

542
00:37:15,603 --> 00:37:18,678
I would not have

543
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:22,544
Wan is too smart,

544
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:25,692
making you seem foolish.

545
00:37:25,692 --> 00:37:29,373
Although I don't understand, but I will listen to you.

546
00:37:29,425 --> 00:37:32,425
Your Majesty is not sharing his worries with me now.

547
00:37:32,469 --> 00:37:35,971
So I will have to find my own way,

548
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:39,303
else Wan might be the second Lady Hua.

549
00:37:39,303 --> 00:37:42,347
I guess she won't be that serious.

550
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,028
She does not have the ability to do that either.

551
00:37:45,585 --> 00:37:48,912
She have the ability to get Your Majesty love her.

552
00:37:48,946 --> 00:37:51,433
It is always good to be more wary.

553
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:55,155
Nian Gengyao is also affected

554
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:58,864
by the capture of Lord Dun.

555
00:37:58,887 --> 00:38:02,104
You can worry less about Lady Hua now.

556
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:08,473
Good morning Empress.

557
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,285
Please rise.

558
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:15,853
Thank you.<br>I am feeling unwell,

559
00:38:15,853 --> 00:38:18,783
I would like to excuse myself.

560
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:23,189
It's okay. Since there's nothing much, everyone may leave.<br>Wan, please stay.

561
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:31,609
Goodbye.

562
00:38:38,622 --> 00:38:41,234
Please have a seat.

563
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:47,344
Thank you.

564
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:50,347
You've have a hard time.

565
00:38:50,383 --> 00:38:54,668
This is nothing compared to Empress.

566
00:38:54,747 --> 00:38:58,707
It is our responsibility to take care of Your Majesty.

567
00:39:03,328 --> 00:39:07,013
the people around here will be involved as well.

568
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:09,738
After that, not many will be left here.

569
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:13,233
Are you going to select more ladies for Your Majesty?

570
00:39:13,822 --> 00:39:16,741
Your Majesty does not want that.

571
00:39:17,353 --> 00:39:21,347
What we meant is that, many people have contributed

572
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:27,826
to put down Lord Dun. <br>If there are any suitable

573
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:31,838
ladies within these people,

574
00:39:35,804 --> 00:39:38,589
You have the same thinking as Your Majesty and I.

575
00:39:38,634 --> 00:39:41,936
Then I shall choose a good day

576
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:51,178
Empress is the leader of the Inner Palace, it's up to your decision.

577
00:39:51,178 --> 00:39:55,475
But you are also from a family that contributed as well.

578
00:39:55,507 --> 00:39:59,183
I da
