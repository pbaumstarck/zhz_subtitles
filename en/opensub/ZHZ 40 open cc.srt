Subbed by the Legend of Zhen Huan Team@Viki
Episode 40

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,700
Look.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,000
These are Yun-Li's indictments that were drafted
by the imperial ministers.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,500
There are a total of eight accusations.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,800
Contempt towards the king, desertion of the late emperor,

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,000
Cronyism, disordered affairs of state,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,800
impeding anothers voice, beating up the minister,

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,300
ill-intentioned, abuse of martial arts.

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,500
All the indictments lead to the death penalty.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,000
All of it is the truth. He isn't innocent.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Does Your Majesty really want to sentence him to death?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now matter how, I have to forgive his sins.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,800
I can forgive him because of

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,000
him killing his own brothers.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,500
He is not worth it.

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,400
On account that Dun Qinwang has merits on the battlefield, <br>and contributed for so many years,

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,900
and him being my brother,

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,600
killing him will upset the soul of the previous Emperor.

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,000
I cannot bear to kill him so I need to <br> spare him the death penalty.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,900
His title is to be removed...

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,143
and he will be demoted to a commoner.

22
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:11,835
He is to spend the rest of his days<br> under arrest in Zhong Ren Fu.

23
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:14,613
No visitors will be allowed.

24
00:01:14,703 --> 00:01:18,191
Then what about his wife, daughter, and son?

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,400
They will be demoted to commoners too.

26
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,000
But I have allowed them

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to stay in Lord Dun's old residence.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,965
Empres Dowager agreed with me.

29
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:30,900
Since Yun-Li has been punished,

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,000
his followers must be dealed with next. <br>

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,900
This is the most important now.

32
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,900
One of my ministers said,

33
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:44,000
in order to avoid another upheaval

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,900
we must annihilate Du Family

35
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,800
as a warning to others.

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,000
What do you think Your Majesty?

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,900
It is somehow reasonable.

38
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,900
Your Majesty, the greeting memorial <br>from the Northwest has arrived.

39
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,700
Please look over it, Your Majesty.

40
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,900
Nian Genghyao's is acting fast.

41
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,900
Lord Dun's case has just happened,

42
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,800
I don't know what could <br>Nian Gengyao's memorial contain...

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,000
... I am afraid his intention is to test Your Majesty.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's a congratulatory letter

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,600
about the sky phenomenon.

46
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm too lazy to read. You read, I'll listen.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,700
Your Majesty, I don't dare to read.

48
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,500
Why? Let me see.

49
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Your Majesty, you shouldn't look over the words of regicide.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,400
Bring it over.

51
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,700
The four words "Chao Gan Xi Ti",

52
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,900
originally praise me for working hard on government affairs.

53
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,100
Except in illegible handwriting in Nian Gengyao's letter

54
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,300
He has written the four words as "Xi Yang Chao Gan"

55
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,687
It means the end of a Dynasty.

56
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,800
This might have been because of <br> General Nian's inadvertent mistake.

57
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,100
Nian Gengyao is not a careless person.

58
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,000
He doesnt wish to praise me with the words

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,600
"Chao Gan Xi Ti"

60
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,700
That being the case,

61
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,800
with Nian Gengyao's merit at Qinghai,

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,400
I am still considering whether I want to approve.

63
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,900
For the most recent cases,

64
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,200
I have reprimanded Nian Gengyao

65
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,000
for his unsuitable speech.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,600
But he did not mend his ways,

67
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,100
but he counted on his merits

68
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,300
and even used disrepesctful words.

69
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,800
This mistake is definitely deliberate.

70
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't get angry, Your Majesty.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,800
Why don't we make note of those disrepectful words,

72
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,800
and send them back to General Nian

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and let him explain to your majesty.

74
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,300
This is obviously in black and white. <br>What else should he explain?

75
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,900
Your Majesty, just let him explain..

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,200
We should give him the chance to explain

77
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,700
before we judge him.

78
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,400
Su Pei-Sheng

79
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,400
Your Majesty.

80
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,000
Send it back to the Northwest as it was to Nian Gengyao's hands..

81
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,600
Don't make any mistakes.

82
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,700
Yes.

83
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,900
Deliver an imperial order- dismiss Nian Genyao's relative-

84
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,800
Hu Qi-Heng, the grand coordinator in Gansu province.

85
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,700
Transfer the Temporary Sichuan Prefect, Na Tai back to Beijing.

86
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,000
Your servant will handle this immediately.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,900
Zhou Ning-Hai, make your words clear.

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,100
Imperial Consort.

89
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,200
General Nian has sent a congratulatory letter to the Emperor about the astrology matter.

90
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,900
But maybe because General Nian is busy, he wrote the wrong words.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,100
What are the words?

92
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,300
Great General wrote the "Chao Gan Xi Ti" as "Xi Yang Chao Gan"

93
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,300
Thats not too bad..

94
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,300
It is just a bit different..

95
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,500
But the Emperor is very angry.

96
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,800
How about the memorial?

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,600
The Emperor didnt approve it. He sent it back.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,100
Imperial Consort.

99
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,900
These days are really not as good as the past..

100
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,400
Last time it was brothers retainers..

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,600
...now it is Lord Dun's case..

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,600
Although it is not directly related to my brother,

103
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,700
it all depends on the Emperors approval.

104
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,000
It seems like it is not approved.

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,300
I am afraid it is not good news.

106
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,900
Imperial Consort, you have to find <br>a way to help Great General.

107
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,964
What else can I do?

108
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:28,430
We can only let brother give out his loyalty

109
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,200
and try to seek forgiveness from the Emperor.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Go and see

111
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,200
if the Emperor has time to meet me.

112
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes.

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,900
Your servant will go immediately.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,500
Report to Your Majesty.

115
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,000
Nian Gengyao relied on power and influence for domineering

116
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:50,250
recruited the people of the same view to take bribes,

117
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,300
abused military exploit, misappropriated public funds,

118
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:54,576
killed and persecuted the innocent civilians,

119
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,600
plotted rebellion matters is too numerous to record.

120
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,800
Your Majesty,

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,600
Nian Gengyao deceived monarch, disloyal and illegal.

122
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:05,512
Anybody has the right to put him to death.

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,700
Your Majesty, Nian Gengyao has failed to live up.

124
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,800
His loyalty to country, he should receive death penalty.

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,600
But he has a high official position and military power.

126
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:18,917
He is far away at Northwest and has many partisans.

127
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:21,068
We cannot be hasty.

128
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,000
I am afraid we might force him to rebel with his military power.

129
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,500
Why don't we blame strictly and punish slowly?

130
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,000
Nian Gengyao didn't abide to the behavior of the minister.

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,400
Nian Gengyao didn't abide to the behavior of the minister.

132
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,700
He broke the law openly without fear.

133
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,000
If I don't punish him strictly,

134
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,400
how can I appease the people and regenerate the imperial regime?

135
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
How can I appease the people and revive the imperial regime?

136
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,100
Nian Gengyao's followers

137
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,000
are still together.

138
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,300
If they follow the old ways

139
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,000
and fail to live up to the loyalty of the country for self-benefits,

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,200
outwardly denoucing

141
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
but secretly encouraging,

142
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,300
they should be punished strictly

143
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,700
for the crimes agains the country.

144
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,300
Your Majesty is brilliant.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,100
Your Majesty is brilliant.

146
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,000
Greetings Your Majesty.

147
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,800
Get up.

148
00:08:41,864 --> 00:08:43,870
Thank you Your Majesty.

149
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,000
This is Nian Gengyao's explanatory memorial.

150
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:49,369
You may read it.

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Nian Gengyao recites his loyalty to the Emperor

152
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
over all those years.

153
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,900
Only, this is my presumption,

154
00:09:01,944 --> 00:09:04,417
Nian Gengyao carefully calculated his merits.

155
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,100
He lists his merits to the Emperor only to gloat.

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,800
He is using his merits to intimidate the Emperor.

157
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
It is obvious.

158
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,100
In order to clear his name,

159
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,700
he even took the risk to indicate <br>that his merit is greater than the Emperor.

160
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,600
I also think so.

161
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,400
He means

162
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,000
I can't bring peace and stability

163
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
to the country without him.

164
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,500
Nian Gengyao has gotten arrogant.

165
00:09:34,516 --> 00:09:37,989
Your Majesty repeatedly tolerated him <br> but he only got more arrogant.

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,900
When punished minister, Yun-Li wanted to rebel

167
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:43,217
he contacted Nian Gengyao by sending letters.

168
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:45,900
Your Majesty just got one of the letters,

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,900
there must have been more previously.

170
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,700
Nian Gengyao withheld the information

171
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,400
and attracted Yun-Li to become his friend in order to cooperate with him.

172
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,948
Without Nian Gengyao's mistake,

173
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,000
I would've never believed that.

174
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,100
Nian Gengyao makes my blood freeze.

175
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,600
I have tolerated it for too long.

176
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,600
Now I no longer have to.

177
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,200
My order.

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Dismiss Nian Gengyao's post as Sichuan's and Shaanxi's Governor

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and demote him as Hangzhou's general.

180
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Yue Zhong-Qi will concurrently be responsible for his post.

181
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,600
Zhang Ting-Yu,

182
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,300
draft an imperial decree according to my words.

183
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Yes.

184
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,500
I heard that brother's explanatory memorial has been sent.

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,800
I don't know how it is.

186
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,800
His Majesty was always generous <br>with Great General and Imperial Consort.

187
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,300
No matter how angry His Majesty is, it will be fine after His Majesty reprimand or punish him.

188
00:10:36,313 --> 00:10:38,158
Don't be worry, Imperial Concubine.

189
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,300
These events happen constantly.

190
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,900
Although His Majesty dotes on you

191
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and also treat me as usual,

192
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,900
his heart is still unstable.

193
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,400
After the replacement, Imperial Consort is uneasy everyday.

194
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,900
If it goes on like this, it will affect
Imperial Consort's health.

195
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,400
Imperial Consort, bad news..

196
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,800
Great General's post as Sichuan's and Shaanxi's Governor will be dismissed.

197
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,200
Imperial Consort.

198
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,200
Greetings Your Majesty.

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,900
Your Majesty seems to be in a good mood today.

200
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,900
Yes.

201
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,500
Lately I was too busy with political affairs

202
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,000
and had no mood to listen to your singing.

203
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,200
I, too, haven't seen Your Majesty for a long time now.

204
00:11:31,246 --> 00:11:32,799
Haven't seen for a long time?

205
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,300
Do you have no energy to play Yueqin?

206
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,200
Yes.

207
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:39,793
Because I haven't seen Your Majesty for awhile now, my skills are rusty.

208
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
What happened to your hand?

209
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,100
Its nothing.

210
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,600
It is almost healed.

211
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,500
You are not allowed to hide something from me.

212
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:52,536
Sister Wan and I are as close as sisters,

213
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:55,617
A while go, Sister miscarriied.

214
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,000
Although she recovered, she is still weak.

215
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,800
I heard that taking human blood as medicine is the best for physical health.

216
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,900
So I cut my wrist

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,100
for my Sister.

218
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,700
It is an unreliable rumor. You're silly.

219
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,100
But Sister's body improved a lot,

220
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,700
didn't it?

221
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,100
That day, I sent Imperial Concubine Wan to Penglai Island.

222
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:23,967
You came to me and beg to follow.

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,300
At that time I knew that there is a strong bond between you two.

224
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,000
If you didn't follow her,

225
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,000
then she must've had it tough in those days.

226
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,800
I should share weal and woe with my sister.

227
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,800
In the future, I also hope to always accompany Your Majesty

228
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,628
and my sister around.

229
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,000
Stop the sedan chair.

230
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,100
Stop quickly.

231
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100
My lady.

232
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,500
I wish Imperial Consort Hua auspicious. I wish Imperial Consort Zhi auspicious.

233
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:01,706
Is His Majesty here?

234
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,400
Lady An is accompanying him.

235
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,800
Move aside.

236
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,477
His Majesty gave orders that Imperial Concubine doesn't need to come greet or request to meet.

237
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,300
Why does His Majesty refuse to meet me?

238
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,200
It is His Majesty's orders. I don't dare to speculate.

239
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,511
Imperial Concubine. Imperial Concubine, think twice...

240
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,767
Imperial Consort. Imperial Consort

241
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:19,200
Imperial Consort...

242
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,000
Your Majesty.

243
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,700
My brother did not intend to confront Your Majesty's dignity.

244
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,765
The four words "Xi Yang Chao Gan" is an unintentional mistake.

245
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,900
I hope Your Majesty look at my brother's credit,

246
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,837
and forgive him, Your Majesty.

247
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
Imperial Consort..

248
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,500
the more you do things like this,

249
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,000
<br>the more embarassing it will be for you.

250
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,800
I must kneel

251
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,100
until His Majesty is willing to meet with me.

252
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,900
Your Majesty!

253
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,800
Your Majesty!

254
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,400
Your Majesty. Imperial Consort is begging outside.

255
00:13:56,445 --> 00:14:00,870
Your Majesty. Imperial Consort is begging outside.

256
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,300
Would you like to see her?

257
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,900
I knew she would come.

258
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,400
I don't want to see her so I summoned you.

259
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,600
But Imperial Consort Hua is begging miserably outside.

260
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,587
It has disturbed Your Majesty.

261
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,900
Su Pei-Sheng.

262
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,400
Your Majesty.

263
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,100
Go tell Imperial Consort Hua that if she wants me to be angry, then just keep crying.

264
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,300
Yes.

265
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,900
Your Majesty.

266
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,600
Sister,

267
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,697
you're being at leisure.

268
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,600
You've came.

269
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,200
Are you still blaming me?

270
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,600
If I did, I woud've let you <br>freeze at Penglai Island

271
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,700
Why did I send You autumn clothes then? <br>I am regretting it.

272
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,200
It's too late for that.

273
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
I have already worn them.

274
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,400
It was all my fault that day.

275
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,200
I shouldn't have doubt you.

276
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,000
That day I told you I have <br>reasons for concealing it

277
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,000
As it was connected to state affairs,<br> I was unable to tell you.

278
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,200
This caused our misunderstanding.

279
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,100
I do not know why

280
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,600
I said to you those things then,

281
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,200
Sister's tongue is sharper<br> than her heart.

282
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,800
I always knew that.

283
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,100
I heard that Nian Gunyao has lost the favor.

284
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,900
Imperial Consort Hua's position <br>is precarious.

285
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,000
Lady Zhi also moved out.

286
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
It's not enough for her <br>precarious position

287
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,300
I am like you, sister.

288
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,600
We are both waiting for <br>this building to tumble down.

289
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,300
We are not from her circle,

290
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,100
therefore have no information about her

291
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,900
It's time for us to use few people.

292
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,300
Imperial Consort Hua's brother was punished<br>for his disrespect towards the Emperor.

293
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,900
Although I am aware

294
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,300
that you don't like Consort Hua's temper

295
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,400
we are all however sisters in the palace.

296
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,600
We have to comfort her at this time.

297
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Yes, Imperial Consort.

298
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,900
Anyway

299
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,100
Although Imperial Consort Hua is to be pitied,

300
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,700
it was her brother's, Nian Gengyao's fault.

301
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,100
He was always dominant and arrogant.

302
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,800
he even dared to disagree with the Emperor.

303
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,100
If he mended his wrongdoings earlier,

304
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,700
he wouldn't have come to the situation, <br>where all ministers are blaming him.

305
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:51,537
Please forgive me, Imperial Consort. I am guilty.

306
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,400
What happened to you suddenly?

307
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,600
I am aware of a matter but has concealed it until now.

308
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,400
Now I don't dare to conceal it anymore.

309
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,306
What is it? Say it.

310
00:17:00,306 --> 00:17:04,669
A few years ago when I was in the Summer Palace, Imperial Consort Hua incited someone to

311
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:07,778
put tapioca into Princess Wen-Yi's chesnut soup to poison her

312
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,553
put the blame on Imperial Concubine Wan.

313
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,100
She failed to put the blame on Imperial Concubine Wan

314
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
so she incited Xiao Tang from the Imperial kitchen to be the scapegoat.

315
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,700
Since you knew this,

316
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,100
why did you hide the truth until now?

317
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,000
Originally, I didn't know about that.

318
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,000
I was hoodwinked by Imperial Consort Hua too.

319
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,400
I believed that Imperial Concubine Wan did it.

320
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:28,184
Until one day, I saw Imperial Consort Hua

321
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:31,427
incited Xiao Tang to be the scapegoat did I know.

322
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:35,100
But Imperial Consort Hua discovered me,

323
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,200
she threatened me

324
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,000
that if I spread this matter,

325
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,800
then she will deprive the custody of princess.

326
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,300
Poor little Wen-Yi.

327
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,550
She has to sustain to such a sin at such a young age.

328
00:17:47,582 --> 00:17:50,654
I understand Lady's Cao's feelings.

329
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,000
What mother is not afraid that her child

330
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,200
is deprived of them.

331
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,300
That day, her poisoning incident,

332
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,400
Everyone doubted it.

333
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,463
But His Majesty refused to track down

334
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:03,203
In order to take account of consorts' dignity.

335
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:05,292
If that is the truth,

336
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,493
Consort Hua is really evil!

337
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,900
Although she isn't Wen Yi's biological mother,

338
00:18:09,943 --> 00:18:12,977
-how could she do that to a child?<br>- But Niangniang,

339
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,800
Xiao Tang has already been beaten to death.

340
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:19,386
The dead can't bear witness now!

341
00:18:19,386 --> 00:18:22,800
That day, Consort Hua instigated two courtiers to say that they saw...

342
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,900
Imperial Concubine Wan passing my residence.

343
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,870
Later on, Consort Duan bore witness to the fact that it was slander.

344
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,100
That was Imperial Consort Hua's real intention.

345
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:36,436
My poor Wen Yi. <br>She is just an infant, but has to suffer so.

346
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:41,429
Imperial Concubine Wan,

347
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
this case is related to you.

348
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,100
What do you have to say?

349
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,200
That day

350
00:18:47,235 --> 00:18:49,105
I

351
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,600
...really am innocent.

352
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,700
I know.Sit down.

353
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,600
Thank you Niang Niang.

354
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,700
Jiang Fu Hai

355
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,300
Your servant is here.

356
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,900
Ask Imperial Consort Hua to come here.

357
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,100
Yes.

358
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:08,831
Imperial Consort.

359
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,600
In regard of Great General,

360
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,600
there is a new decree.

361
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,500
What did Emperor say?

362
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,800
That... that...

363
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,600
Just say it.

364
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,100
There is nothing I can't stand.

365
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,700
Great General is to lose his title as a teacher,

366
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:26,572
and the title of the First Duke.

367
00:19:26,572 --> 00:19:30,223
Also his two sons, Nian-Fu and Nian Xing, <br>will loose their posts

368
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:35,449
It's brother's fault.

369
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:37,300
Why are Nian-Fu and Nian-Xin also involved?

370
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,800
Emperor must still be angry, <br>otherwise he wouldn't refuse

371
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:42,400
to meet Imperial Consort.

372
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,300
Greetings, Imperial Consort.

373
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,200
What is it?

374
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,700
Empress wants to meet you.

375
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,300
Please go to the Palace of Great Benevolence.

376
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,100
Great. I also want to meet the Empress.

377
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,800
Let's go.

378
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,941
Please forgive me, my lady,

379
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,168
I have something I dare not disclosure.

380
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,400
Don't be afraid to speak.

381
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:10,778
Lady Chun

382
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,200
was murdered.

383
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,800
Didn't she drown?

384
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
As I know,

385
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,600
Lady Chun knew how to swim.

386
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,594
You speak

387
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,900
That day, Lady Chun picked up at kite by the lake.

388
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,000
I was playing with princess at rockery.

389
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,900
Who would've known

390
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:37,704
I will see Consort Hua ordering her eunuch, Zhong Ning-Hai

391
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,222
to press Lady Chun under water.

392
00:20:41,822 --> 00:20:44,492
Lady Chun died after few moments of struggling.

393
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,570
Then Zhou Ning-Hai <br>pushed Lady Chun into water

394
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,682
to make it look like she drowned.

395
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,500
What happened then?

396
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:58,109
I... I was to scared.

397
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,777
I wanted to leave as soon as possible.

398
00:20:59,777 --> 00:21:02,389
But the princes started to cry.

399
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:03,918
The cry alarmed Consort Hua.

400
00:21:03,918 --> 00:21:07,116
I was so scared I lost strength <br>in hands and feet.

401
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,300
Imperial Consort Hua said

402
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
that if I tell others

403
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,300
she would kill me and the princess.

404
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,200
I was really scared.

405
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:22,643
Imperial Consort Hua dared <br>to kill Lady Chun in the palace,

406
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:25,182
naturally she would also <br>kill me and the princess

407
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,900
However, every night I see Lady Chun<br> succumbing to her terrible fate.

408
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:34,847
I really can't stand it anymore.

409
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:37,532
Why did she kill Lady Chun?

410
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,900
I inquired some more after this incident.

411
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:45,317
Lady Chun was killed because <br>she accidentally ran into Imperial Consort Hua

412
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:49,808
collecting bribes from the officials from outside, <br>who were willing to get introduced

413
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,837
to General Nian as officers.

414
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,878
My lady, how can Consort Hua be that audacious?

415
00:21:54,928 --> 00:21:57,810
No wonder she likes expensive things.

416
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,401
She spends the money like water.

417
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:03,691
I thought the money comes from <br> her mother's house or General Niang

418
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,200
I didn't expect her <br>to actually collect bribes.

419
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,000
How much has she received?

420
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,400
I don't know it for sure...

421
00:22:10,408 --> 00:22:12,988
but the total shouldn't be less<br> than two hundred thousand.

422
00:22:12,988 --> 00:22:15,523
His Majesty hates corrupt officials the most!

423
00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:18,107
But the corruption has entered the palace!

424
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,179
Slut!

425
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,778
Consort Hua, what are you doing? <br>I will not tolerate such wanton behavior in Palace of great Benevolence!

426
00:22:30,778 --> 00:22:33,720
This is not the first time I act like this, <br>although you barely tolerate it.

427
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,200
From now on it will only become worse.

428
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,686
Slut. Slut. How dare you betray me?!

429
00:22:40,686 --> 00:22:43,075
Did you forget who gave you this position?

430
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:45,386
Weren't you willing to please me in any way?

431
00:22:45,386 --> 00:22:47,705
I wasted all that effort on you!

432
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:50,200
Everybody heard what Consort Hua said herself!

433
00:22:50,254 --> 00:22:52,832
Lady Cao was under her care previously, <br>

434
00:22:52,832 --> 00:22:55,973
thus there is no doubt in Lady Cao's words.

435
00:22:55,981 --> 00:22:58,688
Jian Qiu, inform the Emperor <br>I request Criminal Division

436
00:22:58,688 --> 00:23:01,113
to investigate people <br>from the Palace of Supporting Earth

437
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,500
Yes.

438
00:23:05,057 --> 00:23:06,885
It's you.

439
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,900
Or the Empress.

440
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,800
Or maybe one of you here

441
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:19,054
who incited this slut to frame me!

442
00:23:20,004 --> 00:23:21,643
No one wants to frame Imperial Consort.

443
00:23:21,643 --> 00:23:25,180
What is done by night, appears at day.

444
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,774
You are all putting salt in my wounds.

445
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,500
You all want to go against me.

446
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,200
I don't think I will get anything <br>from you in this condition.

447
00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:38,941
Go back to your palace.

448
00:23:38,941 --> 00:23:41,717
Don't act like a shrew.

449
00:23:41,717 --> 00:23:44,800
No matter what, you are still emperor's concort.

450
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,900
If the Empress wants to ask anything,

451
00:23:49,943 --> 00:23:52,769
just come to the Palace of Supporting Earth<br> for answers.

452
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:55,484
I will be waiting for you.

453
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,876
I have tolerated her for so many years.

454
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:10,767
Finally, the happy day of her downfall came.

455
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:13,155
Interrogate all people from her palace.

456
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:16,300
Don't miss anyone.<br>Especially Zhou Ning-Hai.

457
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,599
Ling Zhi, the sound <br>you heard from outside

458
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,572
was it Zhou Ning-Hai <br>suffering from torturing?

459
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,800
Imperial Consort, don't fret about it.

460
00:24:35,026 --> 00:24:37,671
I's already two days and nights.

461
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:43,300
After Criminal Division' investigation, <br>some serets will be revealed

462
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,786
They are able to get information <br>even from the dead.

463
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,678
Imperial Consort, in case you...

464
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,800
I will not regret anything I have done.

465
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,454
I will not blame Zhou Ning-Hai <br>if he betrays me to save himself

466
00:25:02,454 --> 00:25:05,437
I will answer for all by myself.

467
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,657
I only hope that for the sake <br>of our old relationship

468
00:25:09,657 --> 00:25:12,500
Emperor will stop punishing my brother.

469
00:25:17,357 --> 00:25:19,666
Has Huanyi perfume finished?

470
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,812
Hurry, refill it.

471
00:25:21,825 --> 00:25:23,728
Yes.

472
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:29,937
Greetings, Imperial Consort.

473
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,811
Why did you come here again?

474
00:25:34,811 --> 00:25:39,552
Empress knows you are concerned <br>about your brother

475
00:25:39,552 --> 00:25:42,500
So she asked me to inform you that...

476
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,810
My brother has been demoted.

477
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,935
The Emperor is still refusing to spare him?

478
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:52,871
As soon as the general returned to his provinces <br>there were rumors saying

479
00:25:52,871 --> 00:25:56,455
he accused Emperor of believing calumnies <br>said by one of the ministries.

480
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:58,199
What was also said?

481
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:03,327
He even dared to utter that <br>he wants to become the Emperor.

482
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:06,500
One should not believe in gossips.

483
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,800
My brother would never <br>utter such rebelious words

484
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:16,376
I think all of you just want <br>to put the blame on him.

485
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:21,327
Imperial Consort. It is people who gossip, <br>but it is the person who does the deeds.

486
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:23,473
You can't blame others.

487
00:26:23,473 --> 00:26:27,356
General arrived in Yizheng of Jiangsu and did nothing

488
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,651
than instigating others to give him<br>the position of Shaanxi Governor.

489
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:35,333
Emperor scolded him angrily <br>for doing nothing and delaying.

490
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,900
Imperial Consort, <br>there is a new decree from Emperor.

491
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
General is demoted to being <br>a guard at Hangzhou gate.

492
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:49,200
Imperial Consort. <br>This decree was just written out.

493
00:26:55,173 --> 00:26:58,283
Emperor is really ruthless.

494
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,200
Emperor is really very ruthless.

495
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,600
Imperial Consort. <br>Please wake up, Imperial Consort.

496
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,533
Your Majesty, this is <br>Zhou Ning-Hai's confession.

497
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:25,678
This confession mentions <br>the tapioca case mentioned by Lady Cao

498
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:30,152
Lady Chun's death, <br>collecting bribes from officials,

499
00:27:30,152 --> 00:27:34,896
inciting someone to put poison<br>in Consort Wan's medicine,

500
00:27:34,896 --> 00:27:39,184
pushing Lady Hui into the water,<br> framing Lady Hui for fake pregnacy

501
00:27:39,184 --> 00:27:44,367
and giving the utensils previously used<br>by epidemic patient in the palace

502
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,546
to Lady Hui in order to infect her.

503
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:49,916
There are also events <br>concerning other concubines.

504
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:53,463
Please have a look, Your Majesty.

505
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,308
That all was exposed by Zhou Ning-Hai?

506
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:07,548
Yes, Your Majesty. <br>Zhou Ning-Hai fainted twice during interrogation.

507
00:28:07,548 --> 00:28:11,792
He said he only knew of those <br>and of nothing else.

508
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:13,634
There are more?

509
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,000
Imperial Consort Hua's sins are not enough?

510
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,800
Take it away.

511
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:23,698
Imperial Consort Hua's crimes are too many.

512
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,972
Your Majesty, how do You plan <br>to dispose of Imperial Consort Hua?

513
00:28:28,055 --> 00:28:33,175
Go and investigate all people <br>that stayed in touch with Consort Hua.

514
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,200
All suspicious people <br>are to be beaten to death.

515
00:28:36,235 --> 00:28:38,064
Yes

516
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:44,900
Consort Hua has been doing <br>bad deeds in the palace for many years.

517
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,900
Take away all her titles and demote her to<br>Daying status (female attendand second rank)

518
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,600
You Majesty's generosity and tolerance <br>towards the harem

519
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,620
In my opinion will help Lady Nian <br>to turn over a new leaf

520
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,400
I thank Your Majesty in the name of Lady Nian.

521
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:02,816
But Lady Nian always ask<br>for a meeting with you, Your Majesty

522
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:05,604
I think she would like to appeal

523
00:29:05,665 --> 00:29:09,042
for Your Majesty benevolence <br>towards her family.

524
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,200
I have nothing to say to her.

525
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,600
I remember the day when she<br>first entered the palace.

526
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,000
She was bright and lively.

527
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,400
What made her turn out like that?

528
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,200
Lady Nian can only blame herself for her misfortune.

529
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:36,881
Which girls from contributor's families were picked <br> to enter the palace?

530
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I have to refer my thanks to them.

531
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,300
I have chosen,

532
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:46,304
Censorate Censor, <br>Guwalgiya E-Min's daughter,

533
00:29:46,304 --> 00:29:51,632
as well as Guwalgiya Wen-Yuan and deputy<br>commander of the Calvalry Camp, Li Bin's sister, Li Ying.

534
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:53,267
Please make a decision, Your Majesty.

535
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:55,682
- Li Bin serves under Han's flag?<br>-Yes.

536
00:29:55,821 --> 00:29:58,955
Guwalgiya E-Min serves under <br>Manchu Army's yellow flag

537
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,000
The palace does not have many consorts
under Manchu Army's flag.

538
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,100
It's good to add one more.

539
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,100
Yes.

540
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,300
What status will Your Majesty grant her?

541
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:13,100
I have chosen words "Qi" and "Xiang".<br>Both can be used as titles.

542
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,300
Just name her Lady Qi.

543
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Palace entrance on 1st November.

544
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,100
Good.

545
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,200
How should we dispose of Lady Zhi, <br>that was constantly with Lady Nian?

546
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,600
Just let her continue to be the maid, <br>serving Lady Nian.

547
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,200
Lady Cao was also very close with Lady Niang.

548
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:38,661
Lady Cao

549
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:44,914
Since you knew what she did, <br>why did you tell it only now?

550
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:49,375
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.<br>I dared not to say anything.

551
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:53,084
She was too domineering.<br>She hurt so many concubines.

552
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:56,991
Under her power,<br> I could only remain silent.

553
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,200
to protect myself and the princess

554
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,000
Now that Wen-Yi grew up

555
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,500
I do not want her to share my fate <br>of being compelled by other people

556
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:12,300
It doesn't matter what happens to me.<br>But Weng-Yi is Your Majesty's daughter.

557
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:15,611
Only after Your Majesty struck them down,

558
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:19,799
I was able to tell everything to the Empress.

559
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:22,905
I shouldn't have been forced by lady Niang.

560
00:31:23,101 --> 00:31:25,239
I am willing to receive any punishment.

561
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:28,601
But I beg Your Majesty<br> not to blame for it our princess

562
00:31:28,665 --> 00:31:31,293
Your Majesty, Lady Cao was forced.

563
00:31:31,363 --> 00:31:34,264
Moreover, princess is still young.

564
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:37,238
Sister Cao suffered greatly <br> for the sake of the princess.

565
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,200
Your Majesty should reward her for that.

566
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:57,520
Lady Cao, exposing lady Niang's crimes, <br> rises your virtue.

567
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,800
Thus your title rises to Pin<br> (imperial concubine),

568
00:32:01,035 --> 00:32:03,319
titled Xiang.

569
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:07,664
Elevating ceremony on 1st November.

570
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,000
Thank You, Your Majesty.

571
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,700
How...?

572
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:27,037
Was she sentenced the death penalty?

573
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,592
Then relegation to Cold Palace?

574
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,000
Her titles have been revoked <br> and she was demoted to Dayin.

575
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,199
She is still allowed to stay in Palace of Supporting Earth.

576
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,100
What?

577
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,900
Only this?

578
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,200
Emperor has known all her crimes.

579
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:47,462
He does so due to the guilt he feels<br> when recollecting their long relationship

580
00:32:49,354 --> 00:32:51,172
What about Cao Qin Mo?

581
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,100
Seven truths, three lies.

582
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:57,066
She evaded all the bad things she has done.

583
00:32:57,173 --> 00:33:00,177
She is just a helpless mother, used by the bad consort.

584
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,900
She gained sympathy and forgiveness.

585
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:06,168
Cao Qin Mo is much more smarter than Consort Hua.

586
00:33:06,243 --> 00:33:10,518
Imperial Consort Hua, without Cao Qin Mo,
 is like an eagle with broken wings.

587
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:13,620
Reckles, with no sense of direction,
only knowing how to snatch.

588
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,200
Unable to protest when being blamed.

589
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:32,209
Is your Majesty still worried  about Nian Gengyao's case?

590
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,100
I have deprived him of all his titles,

591
00:33:38,575 --> 00:33:41,388
and made him guard of the gate.

592
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,700
If he would took the punishment humbly,<br> I wouldn't have to kill him.

593
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,985
But Nian Gengyao dares to wear a golden jacket

594
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,100
gifted by me while on the guarding post!

595
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,200
He is so blatant and caused the rumor.

596
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,100
Letting everyone think I am an uncaring monarch.

597
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:07,119
Maybe Nian Gengyao is using this jacket <br>to remind Your Majesty about his merits?

598
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:11,405
It is only that he thinks only of himself,<br>forgetting Your Majesty's dignity.

599
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,200
It should remind me of his merits?

600
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,100
The ministers decided that <br>he committed crime of regicide 5 times,

601
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,100
crime of deceit nine times,

602
00:34:23,224 --> 00:34:29,174
crime of transgression 16,<br>crime of insolence 13.<br> In total 92 crimes

603
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,000
All his crimes should bring him death penalty.

604
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,200
Your Majesty, <br>Lady Nian request meeting with Your Majesty.

605
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,800
Your Majesty.

606
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,000
I refuse to see her.

607
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:46,100
But, Your Majesty, Lady Nian kowtowed 3 times already <br>begging for an audience.

608
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,700
This time even her head is bruised.

609
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,900
Go and tell her, <br>that it is useless even if she kowtows 300 times!

610
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,200
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

611
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:03,400
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

612
00:35:03,576 --> 00:35:07,937
It doesn't matter if Your Majesty punishes me

613
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,000
but please spare my brother's life.

614
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,800
Think of it like keeping a horse or a dog

615
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,186
to keep you company, Your Majesty.

616
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:25,200
Your Majesty, I beg you, Your Majesty.

617
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:32,600
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

618
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:36,882
Find someone to cure her wounds. <br> Let her go back to her palace.

619
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,400
Yes.

620
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:44,228
I beg you, Your Majesty.

621
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,700
Your Majesty.

622
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,200
Because of the contribution in Qinghai, <br>I am unable to give the severest punishment.

623
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,200
I am granting Nian Gengyao death by suicide, <br> Nian Fu - death by decapitation.

624
00:36:14,645 --> 00:36:18,286
His sons above 15 are to be exiled.

625
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,200
Things are almost done.

626
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:49,000
I plan to promote your father<br> as Chancery board of civil,

627
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,200
also for the position of <br> Left Censor in Censorate.

628
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,900
Thank you, Your majesty, for Your generosity,

629
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,100
but I am afraid my old father<br> will be unable to undertake such difficult tasks.

630
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,800
Although your father is old, <br> but having him with me brings me comfort.

631
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,400
Just like you do.

632
00:37:14,018 --> 00:37:18,424
Therefore the post is a reward for him,

633
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,900
but also for you.

634
00:37:23,607 --> 00:37:25,742
Thank you, Your Majesty.

635
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,300
Greetings, Madame.

636
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,300
Get up, girls.

637
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,800
Lady is so kind.

638
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:53,506
Young Master is waiting eagerly.<br> Please go in quickly.

639
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:06,284
Its is so warm, like in springtime.

640
00:38:06,456 --> 00:38:09,755
Young Master hates the cold, so the Emperor <br> ordered to bring in bronze heaters.

641
00:38:09,794 --> 00:38:14,101
- Nice smell. What flower is it?<br>- Its Camellia Pearl. We receive all of them, except the ones for the empress.

642
00:38:14,223 --> 00:38:16,483
- Mother.<br>- Greetings, Consort Wan.

643
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,200
If Consort will does not allow me this courtesy, others will think we are lacking in etiquette knowledge.

644
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,200
Get up, Mother. Sit, quickly.

645
00:38:31,952 --> 00:38:34,304
Why mother didn't bring Yao - Yu this time?

646
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:37,909
Your father just got promoted, <br> so Yao-Yu is getting busy.

647
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:43,321
This morning she went to see the snow with girls from Officer Zhou's family and Cavalry Camp's family.

648
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,300
Mother, I think that

649
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,100
girls should not get involved in official matters.

650
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,000
Father was favored by the former dynasty. <br> We should remember that big tree attracts the wind.

651
00:38:55,101 --> 00:38:57,600
Lately Nian Family disappeared

652
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,824
and our Zhen Family is still<br> in emperor's high regard.

653
00:38:59,824 --> 00:39:02,200
Father has to be careful<br> in his behaviour and speech.

654
00:39:02,336 --> 00:39:05,219
Family Nian's fate<br> is a good lesson for us.

655
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:08,248
Your father often says <br> we need to be very careful

656
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:10,715
In fact, you know your father well.

657
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,700
In his leisurely time just like to buy antiques.

658
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,200
I think that there's nothing to worry about.

659
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,900
Then that's good.

660
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:21,136
Since Mother came today, I will <br> request something of You.

661
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,200
Imperial Consort may freely ask.

662
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,300
Huan-Bi reached the marriageable age.

663
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:31,800
Please ask father to choose a well-behaved and good-looking person from the courtyard if possible.

664
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,100
I would like to accept Huan-Bi as my sister, <br> and marry her off gloriously.

665
00:39:39,874 --> 00:39:43,890
It is only natural that Imperial Consort <br> worries about Huan Bi

666
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,339
Thank You, Madame.

667
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,300
Mother, please take care <br> of this matter also for Liu-Zhi.

668
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,400
Huan Bi and Liu Zhu

669
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,100
both grew up with you.

670
00:39:54,154 --> 00:39:56,550
It will be best to have double good news.
