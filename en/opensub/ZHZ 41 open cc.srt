1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,200
His Majesty has arrived

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,500
Wishing your highness peace and fortune.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,200
You may rise

4
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:11,526
Yes, your majesty

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,900
How is your mother?

6
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:18,096
In reply to your majesty

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,100
Mother went back

8
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:20,907
What?

9
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:22,884
Am I really that frightening?

10
00:00:23,237 --> 00:00:24,834
I even scared away my mother in law?

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,900
Mother often says...

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,500
my father also reminded my mother

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,000
to avoid staying in the palace too long in fear of creating rumors.

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,500
Where are you coming from your majesty?

15
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:43,023
I just came from Chen Ju palace

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,700
Mei Jie Jie's Lotus Omanthus sweet cake tastes the best.

17
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:48,988
Did you try it?

18
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,785
The Lotus Omanthus cake was indeed sweet.

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,100
Yet the person wasn't sweet.

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,500
When I go

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,800
there were two out of three times that she doesn't get close with me.

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,400
Unless she's still angry at me for falsely accusing her.

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,400
Your Highness you mustn't blame her.

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,100
It is my fault.

25
00:01:14,512 --> 00:01:17,279
I didn't mean to blame her so why are you admitting your guilt?

26
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:21,078
Why would Mei sister be mad at you for something that happened so long ago?

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,200
Forgive me if I say to much

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,500
Mei Jie Jie and I were childhood friends

29
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,900
and came in at the same time. We hope to stay by your side for a long time.

30
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,900
Mei Jie Jie has been thoughtful and thinks about your health.

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,900
If you spend too much energy on your concubines

32
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,800
it will eventually be harmful.

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,000
So she told me this in private.

34
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,500
She is worried

35
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:50,107
and also you are concerned with me a bit more than An sister.

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,900
Mei Jie Jie has decided to be like the historical Xian Concubine

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,800
and pray for your health rather than your physical self.

38
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:07,113
All in all Precious Hui seems to care a lot for me.

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,000
On this matter I am not as good as Mei Jie Jie

40
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,700
What?

41
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,500
I can't be like Xian Concubine

42
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,900
I, just want to be with you some more.

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,500
Although Xian Concubine is good

44
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:29,875
she also lost her appeal, not like you.

45
00:02:33,272 --> 00:02:35,511
Niang Niang's long cherished dream is achieved. You don't have to worry anymore.

46
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,909
It doesn't disappoint my intentions.

47
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,109
I've created such good prospects for Wen Yi's future. I congratulate you.

48
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,300
Don't be in such a hurry to congratulate me, this is only the Imperial Concubine rank.

49
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,800
Consort, Noble Consort. I will climb up the ranks one step at a time.

50
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,400
The higher I climb the better Wen Yi's future will be.

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,000
In the future, she will be able to marry and gain a good husband.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,500
Niang Niang you are over thinking it.

53
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,200
Actually if the princess gains the Emperor's love that's the most important.

54
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,954
You don't understand this

55
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,700
The Emperor is in his prime years.

56
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,500
Soon he will have more and more sons.

57
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,800
Princesses already aren't as valued.

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,900
If it was the Empress's daughter Gu Lun Princess then okay.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,800
compared to a small Precious's daughter.

60
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,400
One small mistake

61
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,500
and I will have to take the path of Princess Chao

62
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,800
For the princess Niang Niang sure tries hard.

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,100
I only have Wen Yi this one daughter.

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,900
And she only has this one mother.

65
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,100
In this big palace

66
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,400
only the two of us have similarities.

67
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:50,311
Niang Niang please don't say that.

68
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,500
At least there is Imperial Concubine Wan.

69
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,100
We can't depend on Noble Consort Hua.

70
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,300
Imperial Concubine Wan even more so.

71
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,700
Coming and going when it is to their advantage.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,800
If one day Imperial Concubine Wan prevents me from getting a "Consort" ranking

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,500
I won't have mercy.

74
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:12,587
I've heard that you ordered Nian Geng Yao to commit suicide.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,400
Yes

76
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,200
Nian Geng Yao doesn't have the nerve to disobey.

77
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,700
Once Nian Geng Yao's matter has been resolvrd

78
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,100
you will have one less thing to worry about.

79
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,900
But Nian promised her...

80
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,300
How do you plan to deal with it?

81
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,000
Shi Lan and I

82
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,700
have been married for years and still have feelings.

83
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,600
There are many things I'm sorry for.

84
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,300
As long as she doesn't create problems

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,100
I will eventually give her the "Consort" title.

86
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,800
To let her live peacefully in the palace.

87
00:04:50,844 --> 00:04:52,964
You used your emotions to make decisions.

88
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,000
But Precious Nian's attitude is as aggressive as fire.

89
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,300
This may be difficult.

90
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,000
Mother,

91
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,600
Right now it is a good time to grant Precious Cao as a "Consort"

92
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,000
I will tell her to bring Princess Wen Yi to greet you.

93
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,000
Sounds good.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,800
I haven't seen Wen Yi for a long time.

95
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,000
You have done a good job of handling Precious Cao's issue.

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,300
It's not like I don't know that she betrayed her old master.

97
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,600
But that time

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,600
required her to do these things.

99
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,100
In exposing Promise Nian

100
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:38,202
only she can ensure everyone is convinced.

101
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,000
Your idea is very good.

102
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,300
But this kind of person

103
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,900
giving her a title is right,

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,700
but you shouldn't be intimate with her too much.

105
00:05:48,734 --> 00:05:52,755
Who knows what she thinks about as she goes to sleep?

106
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,500
Both intelligent,

107
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,000
Imperial Concubine Wan is much better.

108
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,300
Being too smart isn't a good thing.

109
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
Nian Geng Yao's problem has been solved.

110
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,500
You don't need to speak to Imperial Concubine Wan about political matters anymore.

111
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,600
Although she listens appropriately,

112
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,000
listening to political matters too often will cause her to be too calculating.

113
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,200
If that happens it would be difficult to deal with.

114
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,900
I have my own judgements.

115
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,800
Although Nian Geng Yao has been disposed of

116
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,000
there are still people in the court who, like him, fight to be favored.

117
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,900
We have to clean them up one at a time.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,500
Nian Geng Yao and Long Ke Duo

119
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,100
helped you become king and have accomplishments

120
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,700
Nian Geng Yao is bossy,

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,500
Long Ke Dong has aged.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,500
You can allow him to go back home.

123
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,100
Mother has been thoughtful for Long Ke Dong.

124
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:01,195
Yet he might not be.

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,700
We'll talk about this in a few days.

126
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,400
Not to mention that I didn't bring up uncle Long Ke Dong.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,800
How would mother first think of him?

128
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,600
It just came out of my mouth

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's getting late,

130
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:25,805
I will take my leave first.

131
00:07:25,835 --> 00:07:27,162
Okay.

132
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,800
Be careful on your way out.

133
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,400
Yes.

134
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,400
His Majesty is leaving!

135
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,300
Zhu Xi,

136
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,700
Yes.

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,400
What do you think the Emperor's intentions are?

138
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,100
After Nian Geng Yao

139
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,100
does he plan to dispose of Long Ke Duo?

140
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,500
The Emperor isn't the type to be ungrateful.

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,400
Really?

142
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,600
But Nian Geng Yao's situation

143
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,700
is being discussed by many people

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
"The Emperor is harsh

145
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,900
and is ungrateful"

146
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,500
Nian Geng Yao has been unrighteous

147
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,200
But Official Long Ke Duo isn't.

148
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,200
But the things I have heard

149
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Long Ke Duo sponsoring officials,

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,300
and creating factions

151
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,000
is not uncommon.

152
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
Empress Dowager,

153
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,200
Don't worry so much about the Imperial Court.

154
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,900
Healing yourself is the most important.

155
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,800
Cao jie jie,

156
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,100
Wan mei mei seems more energetic.

157
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,600
How can it not be? Cao jie jie is living well.

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,100
This morning Precious Qi entered the palace and lives in Chu Xiu Palace.

159
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:10,881
Now it will get interesting.

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,800
Chu Xiu Palace is wealthy and grand.

161
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,300
We can see how much the Emperor values Precious Qi.

162
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,900
Precious Qi's father Gua Er Jia E Ming

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,500
is the hero for managing Lord Dun and Nian Gen Yao.

164
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,800
The Emperor would naturally be more taken by her.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
Yes.

166
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,800
Are you alright?

167
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,100
Get up.

168
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,600
What happened?

169
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,900
What's wrong?

170
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:48,201
What's wrong?

171
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,400
Greetings to Consort Duan.

172
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,700
Greetings Niang Niang

173
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,000
No need.

174
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,000
What happened?

175
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,100
A bunch of worthless people,

176
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,000
How come you can't even properly watch over the princess?

177
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,700
Every day you know how to be lazy

178
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,700
Tomorrow when I return the Empress will beat the crap out of you.

179
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,400
Why don't you check to see that the princess is okay?

180
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,000
Thank you for helping, Consort Duan.

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,500
It's no problem.

182
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,200
Are you okay?

183
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,700
I'm fine.

184
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,000
The princess just slipped

185
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,000
and I was able to catch her in time so it should be alright.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,700
But you should call for a doctor to double check.

187
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,200
You are right,

188
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,700
Yin Xiu hurry and get a doctor.

189
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,400
Yes.

190
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,700
You may rise.

191
00:10:31,707 --> 00:10:32,827
Yes.

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,900
Little Wen Yi,

193
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,000
This child isn't afraid of strangers

194
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,900
and seems to be very close with you.

195
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,900
She's such a good kid.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,600
Princess Wen Yi really likes Consort Duan

197
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,600
It's very nice.

198
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,000
Niang Niang why are you along?

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,100
Where is Ji Xiang?

200
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,200
I asked her to retrieve some water from bamboo leaves.

201
00:10:58,209 --> 00:10:59,888
I was waiting for her here.

202
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,700
Careful you don't get your clothes dirty.

203
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,000
If you don't mind you can come to Sui Yu Xuan to get a change of clothes.

204
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,100
That will be good.

205
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,400
Huan Bi,

206
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,000
Escort her highness.

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,100
Yes.

208
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,200
Niang Niang can leave first, I will arrive shortly

209
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,800
It's a pity that my family is falling apart.

210
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,600
Although I have a Imperial Concubine title

211
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,200
It seems nearly impossible to ensure a good future for Wen Yi.

212
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
If I could be like Consort Duan and be a Consort

213
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,100
then that would be different.

214
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,500
I was just saying it,

215
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,700
please don't take it into heart.

216
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,100
Of course,

217
00:11:54,116 --> 00:11:56,560
It's a good thing that you have these kind of feelings.

218
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,100
Even if you don't care about yourself you need to think about the princess.

219
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm the princess's godmother,

220
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,100
I also hope that she will have a good future so I can benefit.

221
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,300
Then let's hope your words come true.

222
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
I can't compete against you for the Emperor's affection.

223
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,900
Your father just accomplished a major victory and has the Emperor's trust.

224
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,400
It seems that becoming a Consort is inevitable for you.

225
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,200
Wen Yi will have to depend on you.

226
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,600
Assist

227
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:29,926
Help

228
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,500
The Emperor selected these words for your title

229
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,000
and it has quite the deeper meaning.

230
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,400
But your words aren't very clear

231
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,900
so please explain it to me.

232
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,700
What is the reason for your "Precious" title?

233
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,000
It is because the Imperial Court subdued Nian Gen Yao's situation

234
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,600
and in the Harem

235
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,400
and Consort Hua needs someone in front of her to pull down.

236
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,500
You came at the perfect time.

237
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,200
So the reason why the Emperor gave you the "Precious Xiang" title is because of this.

238
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Unfortunately Nian Shi Lan is still a "Promise"

239
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,700
Due to his affection,

240
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,700
the Emperor won't cause her too much grief.

241
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,200
Consort Duan is still in your palace changing clothes.

242
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,400
You should hurry up and go back.

243
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,500
I also need to go back with the princess.

244
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,700
After today's events you need to be careful.

245
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,100
Thank you.

246
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,600
Niang Niang

247
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,700
You've returned.

248
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,200
Please sit.

249
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,400
Jin Xi, take her highness's clothes and tell people to wash it.

250
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:46,384
Okay.

251
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,600
It's cold outside isn't it?

252
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,100
Sit please.

253
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:54,992
Niang Niang are your hands alright? Let me look at it.

254
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,300
It's fine, nothing is wrong.

255
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,100
Niang Niang hasn't ever liked Consort Hua

256
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,600
and Imperial Concubine Xiang was once her person.

257
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,400
How can you selflessly save her child?

258
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,800
The child isn't in the wrong.

259
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,800
You must really love that child.

260
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,800
I am destined to not have any kids.

261
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,000
So I can only show some love for other people's kids.

262
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,900
But that kid really is adorable.

263
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,800
She does have her mother's intelligence.

264
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
Hopefully,

265
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,600
she won't learn to be cunning like her mother.

266
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,100
People learn from what they see and hear.

267
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:39,015
Unfortunately it seems impossible.

268
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,800
If we can change her mother,

269
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,900
and teach her properly then it would be fine.

270
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,400
Greetings to the Empress and my fellow sisters.

271
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,300
You may rise.

272
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,100
Thank you your highness.

273
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,500
So it's true that you were born a beauty.

274
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,100
Come to the front so I can look at you.

275
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,100
Yes.

276
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,400
The person looks decent,

277
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,600
and the title is also nice.

278
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,000
There have been many happy events in the palace.

279
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,300
Precious Qi is very beautiful.

280
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,900
But her eyebrows

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,200
reveals a calculating personality.

282
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,200
The more people in the palace, the more calculating people will be.

283
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,200
The drama will also increase.

284
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,600
But in the palace there will only be more people and never fewer.

285
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,800
You guys guess,

286
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,400
will the Emperor visit her tonight?

287
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,300
What's so difficult to guess? Unless it's going to be you or me.

288
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,500
Oh you!

289
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Her father is the hero for suppressing Nian Gen Yao.

290
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,800
Yes, I think that Precious Qi isn't an ordinary girl.

291
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,600
Of course.

292
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,300
The palace is going to get interesting.

293
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,600
Imperial Concubine Wan!

294
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,400
Wishing that Imperial Concubine and Precious Hui have good fortune.

295
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,800
Greetings Precious Qi.

296
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,400
Before I came in here, father had some instructions.

297
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,800
Your father and my father were at Du Cha together at one point.

298
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,300
So I especially came to greet you.

299
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,800
I have heard that your father

300
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,700
worked tirelessly to handle Nian Gen Yao and now the Emperor has rewarded him generously.

301
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,600
You are exaggerating.

302
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,400
I just came here so if there is something I do incorrectly,

303
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,200
please help me out.

304
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,229
We made it clear that we are old friends,

305
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,100
and yet you still speak so formally, aren't you making yourself a stranger?

306
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,300
If you don't mind,

307
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,300
Can I go to your place to sit?

308
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,800
Of course. I'm only worried that you won't come.

309
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,200
Emperor.

310
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,200
Someone from Jing Shi has come.

311
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Emperor,

312
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,900
It's time to choose the person.

313
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,300
What is that sound outside?

314
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Yes

315
00:18:12,514 --> 00:18:13,992
I will go look

316
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,600
Precious Qi,

317
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,900
Sister, I came here to accompany you.

318
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,200
How come you didn't tell me you were moving here?

319
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,800
That way I can arrange things for you.

320
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:28,942
I just came here and feel very close to you.

321
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,200
And I saw that you are the only one living in Sui Yu Xuan

322
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,600
and thought it would be lonely.

323
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,700
So I specially asked the Emperor and Empress to live with you.

324
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,300
But Sui Yu Xuan is far away

325
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:41,356
how can it compare to Chu Xiu Palace?

326
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,800
Please don't be upset for making my own decision.

327
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,800
In this palace I have no one to rely on.

328
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And the sisters in Chu Xiu Palace aren't easy to get along with.

329
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,700
I just hope for peace

330
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,947
so I came here to be by your side.

331
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,400
Although Sui Yu Xuan is a bit far, it is the most peaceful place.

332
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,000
As long as you like it it's fine.

333
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,600
but...

334
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,300
the west wing was once inhabited by Precious Chun.

335
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,000
Why don't you go to the East wing?

336
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,200
It's bigger too.

337
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:09,577
Thank you sister!

338
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,400
Miss, everything is ready.

339
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,600
You can leave.

340
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,000
It is quite smaller than Chu Xiu Palace

341
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
but it is indeed a nice place.

342
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,400
You may like it, but I think that it is small and far away.

343
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,500
Going to the Emperor's place would take a very long time.

344
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,000
It isn't nearly as convenient as Chu Xiu Palace.

345
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,500
Chu Xiu Palace is convenient,

346
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,400
But there's many people watching.

347
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,000
Although Sui Yu Xuan is far,

348
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,000
but as long as the Emperor thinks of me,

349
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
the distance doesn't matter.

350
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,900
I'm just worried that you will feel wronged.

351
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,500
Before you came in the master told us many times

352
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,500
that when you come here you must stand tall.

353
00:20:02,513 --> 00:20:04,952
Standing out is of important matter.

354
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,500
But I can't become someone who will be calculated by others.

355
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,200
Everyone knows that the Emperor likes Imperial Concubine Wan.

356
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Staying by her side

357
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,000
I won't be at an disadvantage.

358
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,200
Last night you served him

359
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,200
and came here early so it's fine.

360
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,400
Yet you personally help me get ready.

361
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,000
You have worked hard.

362
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,900
i was able to come to the palace because of your care.

363
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,700
Or even if I wanted to serve you I wouldn't be able to.

364
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,900
In the end your father is successful.

365
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,800
The Emperor knows of his accomplishments

366
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,700
or otherwise nothing I said would have worked.

367
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,600
Three years ago during the big serving girls selection

368
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,400
I was sick and missed it. It was a huge regret.

369
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,900
I thought I could depend on this year's selection

370
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
but who knew that he wouldn't choose?

371
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,400
Thankfully with your words you were able to grant my wish.

372
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,003
Helping you is helping the Manchurian people.

373
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Take a look around

374
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,600
Beside me and Precious Fu Cha

375
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,500
everyone else is Han.

376
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,000
Before, Consort Hua was. Now Imperial Concubine Wan also is one.

377
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,900
The Han people get affection...

378
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
How do we make ourselves known?

379
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,900
My father also said this.

380
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
Both are heroes for subduing Nian Geng Yao

381
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Yet why do some get to become officers of the Board of Civil Chancery

382
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,400
but my father is only a vice minister, ranking below others?

383
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,900
There are two kinds of people in this world.

384
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,300
One is first sweet then bitter, the other is first bitter than sweet.

385
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,800
It depends on which one you choose right now.

386
00:21:34,823 --> 00:21:36,959
I choose to work first and then enjoy life.

387
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,300
That's good.

388
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,100
The others can climb their way up because they have a daughter who is being loved.

389
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:45,341
You can also do that

390
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,100
If you want to receive affection, the best way

391
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,400
is to watch others and see how they behave.

392
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,100
Thank you Empress

393
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
The Empress is so kind to you

394
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
and thinks of everything for you.

395
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,400
It's not for any reason

396
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,800
other than we are Man.

397
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Of course she would treat me well.

398
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,900
Young miss is getting affection from the Emperor

399
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,800
Of course the Empress wants to keep you close.

400
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,800
Of the things the Empress awarded us select some of the better ones to give to Imperial Concubine Wan.

401
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,500
This will be a token of my gratitude for living with her.

402
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,000
Who is so insolent as to not bow to Precious Qi?

403
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's no other than concubine Hua.

404
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,200
But you are forgetful

405
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,000
You still think about your previous glorious days,

406
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,500
yet forgot that it collapsed and disappeared.

407
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,000
Collapsed and disappeared?

408
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,900
This phrase was well said.

409
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,000
You rely on your family's accomplishment to come into the palace.

410
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,100
What difference is there between you and the old me?

411
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,200
You think you are living in a wonderful dream.

412
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,900
I'm afraid you'll only end up just like me.

413
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,600
You are only a small "Promise"

414
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,000
yet you offend me.

415
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,500
Wait until I tell the Empress and Imperial Concubine Wan.

416
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,100
So what about the Empress?

417
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,500
So what about Imperial Concubine Wan?

418
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Back then they both lost to me.

419
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And you think you can do better? You are nothing but a maid next to them.

420
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,900
Even though right now they may be content,

421
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
do you think they will be like that forever?

422
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Let's wait and see.

423
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,400
Miss, let's hurry up.

424
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,300
It's illegal to burn paper money in the palace.

425
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,300
If we get discovered we will be punished severely.

426
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,800
In Yi Kun Palace there are only the two of us left,

427
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
and I can't leave the Forbidden Palace.

428
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,700
If I don't burn some money for brother here,

429
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,700
where would I go?

430
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,000
And there's only you

431
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,500
you've been dragged down with me

432
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,500
but you're still willing to stay with me.

433
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,500
I have served you since I was very young.

434
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,200
Everything I do is necessary for you.

435
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,100
I better go outside and watch.

436
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,100
Today you offended Precious Qi, there might be trouble.

437
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,700
Why should I be afraid of her?

438
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,600
If she wants to come, fine.

439
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,700
If the Emperor wants to kill me, fine.

440
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,700
Right now, living

441
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,700
and dying means no difference to me.

442
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,000
Don't be too sad, miss.

443
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,900
We still have many days ahead of us.

444
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But the Emperor,

445
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,200
he killed brother, Nian Fu and Nian Xing.

446
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,500
He's ended our relationship.

447
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,700
What else do I have to live for?

448
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,200
This life

449
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,700
will be spent waiting to die in here.

450
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,800
The Emperor is so unfeeling.

451
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,700
It is all because of Zhen Huan that wrench.

452
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,800
Even if I die,

453
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,600
I will never have mercy on her.

454
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,300
Where is Su Xi?

455
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,300
According to your wishes Su Xi went to work.

456
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,600
His majesty has arrived.

457
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,000
Greetings Emperor.

458
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,600
What's wrong?

459
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,000
You aren't happy?

460
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,500
Since I've come out of my mother's womb I've never suffered so much.

461
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,052
What exactly happened?

462
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,000
If you don't tell you how am I supposed to know your grievances?

463
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Emperor, when I came here,

464
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,200
I don't know if there are different statuses.

465
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,800
Of course.

466
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,900
If someone of lower status offends the one above,

467
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Shouldn't they be punished according to the rules?

468
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
You're right.

469
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,900
Look at you. You've said so much yet still haven't gotten to the point.

470
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,100
How am I supposed to bring justice for you?

471
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,000
I encountered Promise Nian

472
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,300
when,

473
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,200
she didn't respect me

474
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,800
and said that I came to the palace due to my family's accomplishments

475
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and that I am living in a dream.

476
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,800
Then I will end up like her.

477
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,100
Promise Nian's personality isn't that great.

478
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,600
Just ignore her.

479
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,800
Look at you,

480
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,400
after crying your make up is smeared and your face is crooked.

481
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,200
It's not pretty anymore.

482
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,700
Emperor you are being biased.

483
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,100
You just said that the ranks need to behave appropriately

484
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,300
yet when you heard it was Promise Nian you don't care anymore.

485
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,500
She has the nerve to treat me like this

486
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,000
If she kills me one day,

487
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,500
that's not impossible.

488
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,500
Okay,

489
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,800
if you get killed I will be sad.

490
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,800
Go wash your face,

491
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,500
and let me handle this issue.

492
00:27:41,502 --> 00:27:42,684
Really?

493
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,100
Then I can relax.

494
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
Su Pei Sheng

495
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:02,716
Yes?

496
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,100
Did what Precious Qi say really happen?

497
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Emperor,

498
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,300
Precious Qi's words hold truth

499
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,500
but Promise Nian also had a reason

500
00:28:12,522 --> 00:28:14,513
Today marks three weeks after her brother's death.

501
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:16,954
No wonder her mood isn't good.

502
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,400
I heard that last night Precious Qi was upset.

503
00:28:29,462 --> 00:28:32,437
As a girl, losing her temper like this is normal.

504
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,700
Precious Qi isn't the type to make a fuss

505
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,900
so this time there must be a good reason.

506
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,000
Not really, it's just being mad at Promse Nian.

507
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Promise Nian is really something

508
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,500
It's gotten to this point and she's still restless.

509
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:49,319
Promise Nian has made many errors

510
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,500
The Emperor has been gracious yet she still can't change.

511
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,500
It really is betraying his kindness.

512
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,700
Then what do you think we should do?

513
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,400
Nian Geng Yao has died.

514
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:02,941
Leaving Promise Nian's life is already showing mercy.

515
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,300
Yet she doesn't know how to be repentant.

516
00:29:05,325 --> 00:29:07,593
Your majesty why don't you punish her harshly?

517
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,700
Kill her, so the Harem can have some peace.

518
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,800
Come,

519
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,200
You are very smart,

520
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,100
and ruthless as well.

521
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,600
You think that Imperial Concubine Xiang is ungrateful and disloyal,

522
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:41,597
because she wants to kill her old master.

523
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,200
Then I also believe

524
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,000
that this type of person

525
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,500
shouldn't be left by your side.

526
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,800
Actually I know

527
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,900
that Shi Lan's personality isn't evil.

528
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,800
Many things,

529
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,100
were the result of Imperial Concubine Xiang's schemes.

530
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,100
Thankfully Imperial Concubine doesn't have a prominent family.

531
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,600
And you don't show her a lot of love.

532
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,400
or else this type of sly and evil woman

533
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,400
would have been able to stay.

534
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,600
but Wen Yi is still small

535
00:30:14,614 --> 00:30:16,380
and can't leave her mother.

536
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,200
There are plenty of women who don't have kids.

537
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,400
I think

538
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,900
that concubine Jing and concubine Duan are fine.

539
00:30:23,925 --> 00:30:25,842
They both really like kids,

540
00:30:25,855 --> 00:30:28,191
as much she does.

541
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,500
Miss wake up.

542
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,400
I just heated some medicine to calm the nerves.

543
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,900
You should drink it before you sleep to feel better.

544
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,000
In your reply,

545
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,100
What?

546
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,200
In these past few days I've been attentive

547
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,900
and noticed there are always people outside peeping at us.

548
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,500
You clearly saw it?

549
00:31:36,517 --> 00:31:37,406
Yes.

550
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,300
There were two time that I was unsure of,

551
00:31:39,302 --> 00:31:40,705
but I definitely saw it twice.

552
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
His disguise is as a road sweeper.

553
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
He hides by the corner of the wall.

554
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,600
Did you see who it was? Which palace her was from?

555
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,500
It's the servant from Promise Nian's place.

556
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,159
His name is Su Xi.

557
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,200
After the Emperor disposed of Zhou Ning Hai, it's been Su Xi who's been serving her.

558
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,600
I've seen him carrying flint around with the intent to use it.

559
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:03,538
Only the palace's rules are strict and he hasn't gotten it yet.

560
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Do you want me to capture him and take him to the Emperor?

561
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,700
Just ignore him.

562
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,500
Make sure that you watch his every move.

563
00:32:17,508 --> 00:32:18,800
Don't alert him to anything.

564
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:19,791
Yes.

565
00:32:19,831 --> 00:32:21,193
I will take my leave.

566
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,100
Today's sunshine is really nice.

567
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:36,962
Go invite Mei jie jie to come play chess.

568
00:32:36,962 --> 00:32:38,040
Yes.

569
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,800
But today the Empress invited Precious Qi and them to watch opera.

570
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,700
Do you want to go too?

571
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,100
I heard that Precious An is going too.

572
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,000
Today it's their turn to be the main character.

573
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I won't go disturb them.

574
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,100
Go invite Mei jie jie.

575
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:55,004
okay.

576
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,200
Today I've called you to watch opera

577
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,600
because it is almost the new year.

578
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,000
I believe that everyone will miss their homes.

579
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,900
Secondly, here we don't have to talk so formally like in Jing Ren Palace.

580
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,800
Niang Niang is generous. We will keep that in our hearts.

581
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,600
Okay, get up so we can watch opera.

582
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,300
Thank you.

583
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,500
Thankfully Empress is here.

584
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,400
Otherwise when it's the new year

585
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,900
I would feel all empty inside.

586
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,300
Including being bullied and be looked down upon.

587
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,000
In my heart -

588
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,500
Living in the Palace is different from living at home.

589
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,000
No matter what you will feel upset.

590
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,100
But everone here ares sisters.

591
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,400
So we must treat each other well.

592
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,600
With your words I feel so much more warmth in mt heart.

593
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,000
Precious Qi speaks so eloquently.

594
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,100
You've said everything we wanted to.

595
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,400
It makes us seem inarticulate.

596
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,900
Now we don't know how to say anything.

597
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,500
Listening to your conversations makes me think you are talking to family members.

598
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,300
I feel very comfortable listening to it.

599
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,000
As long as you don't mind my rambling then it's all good.

600
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,700
At home I have two concubine sisters but we can't carry conversations.

601
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,100
But after seeing you I feel as though I have many things to say.

602
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:39,023
I have misspoken, please forgive me.

603
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Empress, Precious Qi didn't do it on purpose.

604
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,200
No matter, let's watch the opera.

605
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,300
Thank you.

606
00:34:49,302 --> 00:34:50,906
Please forgive us.

607
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,300
I've already said

608
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,900
that we are all sisters and don't need to hold grudges.

609
00:34:56,925 --> 00:34:58,191
Get up.

610
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Thank you for your generosity.

611
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,100
You may all leave.

612
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,499
Yes.

613
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,700
You are also tired, why don't you retire early?

614
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,200
Talking to Precious Qi is indeed tiring.

615
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,400
But you are different, you are smart.

616
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,800
Thank you for your compliments.

617
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:39,387
But I hope that you won't be mad at Precious Qi.

618
00:35:39,394 --> 00:35:42,410
Precious Qi is foolish but is a beauty.

619
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,600
The palace needs this type of woman.

620
00:35:44,616 --> 00:35:48,579
To serve the Emperor well one does not need intelligence, beauty is all that's necessary.

621
00:35:48,591 --> 00:35:52,169
This type of person ensure that his love will be split and not compete for it.

622
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,800
So I like you.

623
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,400
You aren't the most beautiful but you are clever and loyal to me.

624
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,600
I am a boring person but being by you

625
00:36:03,638 --> 00:36:05,443
I will definitely be loyal.

626
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Being loyal isn't just something you say.

627
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,200
Time reveals a person's true character.

628
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,965
I understand

629
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm petty and lowly.

630
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,200
I have no title and I'm only a "Precious"

631
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,500
I can't compete with Precious Qi

632
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,600
So what if your background is low?

633
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,300
I was also born from a concubine.

634
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,000
So I hate it the most when others say the words "of lowly birth"

635
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,100
But then again so what?

636
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,900
I still am the mother of the entire kingdom.

637
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,000
At least your father was the county magistrate of Song Yang.

638
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,500
If you think your background is really that bad, why don't you use your charm to turn things around

639
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,300
and rise?

640
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,800
I thank you for your advice

641
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:55,592
and will definitely keep your words in my heart.

642
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,700
Wrong, wrong!

643
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,400
I want to change my piece.

644
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,000
Don't be like that.

645
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,400
Fine fine.

646
00:37:13,404 --> 00:37:15,051
It's inevitable that I'm going to lose anyways.

647
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,900
I don't want to play anymore.

648
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,000
What's with you.

649
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,000
You can't win so you don't play properly.

650
00:37:21,064 --> 00:37:23,033
You're being so petty.

651
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:25,067
Here, let's play again.

652
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,300
I am really troubled

653
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,400
even if we play ten more times I will still lose.

654
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,800
I know why you are frustrated.

655
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
But the time isn't right.

656
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,900
You've been loved for so many years

657
00:37:39,914 --> 00:37:43,566
but having results isn't something that can happen immediately.

658
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:46,796
You don't understand the hatred in my heart.

659
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,100
I can only hate even more.

660
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,100
The one I lost was my flesh and blood.

661
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,600
Where's Precious Qi? Has she returned?

662
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,000
You've forgotten

663
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,300
After she watched the opera she went to Consort Jing's palace to have dinner.

664
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,600
The snow outside has just melted.

665
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,600
I'm afraid she can't find her way

666
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,800
Go light some extra lights by her door.

667
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,600
Su Xi has arrived.

668
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,800
He sneaked into Precious Qi's sideroom.

669
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,700
After so many days

670
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
he finally has a chance to do his deed.

671
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,200
Whether or not he's able to all depends on you.

672
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,000
If I don't grant his wish

673
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,800
how will he tell his master?

674
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,500
What are you two talking about?

675
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,908
You wait outside first.

676
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,100
After the flames rise then catch him.

677
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:43,959
Yes.

678
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,200
Jie jie

679
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,800
Do you want to see how Nian Shi Lan digs her own grave?

680
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,300
Come with me.

681
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,300
Precious Qi's hall connects to mine.

682
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,800
If the fire on her side grows

683
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,700
I won't have a high chance of surviving.

684
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,600
This is oil used for brushing hair, what are you doing?

685
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,600
Don't say anything.

686
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,900
What are you doing, don't hide it from me.

687
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Nian Shi Lan sent someone to burn me to death.

688
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,700
I am not harming anyone

689
00:39:32,772 --> 00:39:34,634
but I can't let others kill me.

690
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,700
So

691
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
you want to help her.

692
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,500
I'll count it as "borrowing flowers to present to the gods"

693
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,500
Okay, if we are going to act then we need to do it thoroughly.

694
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,900
I don't want her to have a chance of living.
