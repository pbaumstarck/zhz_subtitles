1
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,960
Fire! Fire!

2
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,280
Hurry! Fire!

3
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,280
Hurry up!

4
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:39,040
Fire!

5
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:44,999
Who's there? Why are you acting suspiciously?

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,500
This is the person who started the fire. What?

7
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,958
His majesty has arrived.

8
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,958
Precious Hui how are your injuries?

9
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:16,080
Jie Jie is scared stiff.

10
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,900
It's all my fault.

11
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:20,878
Why did I have to invite her to play chess with me?

12
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,159
Please don't worry Imperial Concubine Wan

13
00:01:23,428 --> 00:01:25,679
Precious Hui's mental state hasn't been greatly affected.

14
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,079
But her injuries are a bit severe.

15
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,559
It was perfectly fine how could a fire start? Where were the servants?

16
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,919
Please forgive me. I was being negligent in my duties.

17
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,119
However the one who started the fire has been caught and is waiting for judgement.

18
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,319
The fire was intentionally started?

19
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:42,700
Yes

20
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,640
Bring him up.

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:43,960
Yes

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,759
Bring him up!

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,120
it was this servant who was behaving suspiciously by Sui Yu Xuan.

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,440
I have already found flint and oil that he carried.

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,800
Which palace are you from?

26
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:02,997
Emperor,

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,900
This person is from Yi Kun Palace and Promise Nian's servant. His name is Su Xi.

28
00:02:07,518 --> 00:02:10,038
I don't know how I offended this servant

29
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:16,959
to have him wish for my place to burn down and for me to die.

30
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:22,318
Emperor, both her and my father are heroes for subduing Nian Geng Yao.

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Promise Nian and I don't get along, Since her punishment she obviously hates the two of us.

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,480
Otherwise how would a lowly servant have the guts to burn down Sui Yu Xuan?

33
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,800
There had to be someone behind this.

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,480
Although Promise Nian is unhappy, she only felt hate towards me.

35
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,984
But I've involved Precious Qi and Mei Jie jie.

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,120
I originally didn't want to ruthless and kill them all

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,680
and wanted to give her a chance to reform.

38
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,480
Who knew that she would become even more devious.

39
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:54,799
Let it pass.

40
00:02:55,359 --> 00:03:00,239
Tell Empress and Consort Jing to interrogate Su Xi into the night.

41
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,000
If this is really the truth, immediately send her to the cold palace and reward her with suicide.

42
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,800
You don't have to report back to me.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,500
Yes.

44
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,700
My plase is smaller than Sui Yu Xuan

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,300
but bear with it and just live here.

46
00:03:22,597 --> 00:03:25,398
I'm very happy to be able to live here.

47
00:03:25,398 --> 00:03:31,317
Do you remember? When we were little we would lie on bed like this and talk.

48
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:33,157
Yes.

49
00:03:35,117 --> 00:03:36,360
It's almost new years.

50
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,079
Interrogating Nian Shi Lan

51
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,597
should not be pushed into the new year

52
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,560
or it may be inauspicious.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,500
Today is the 25th. The latest is the 29th.

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
She has to die.

55
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Or I would have burned myself for nothing.

56
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,760
The Empress and Consort Jing

57
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,100
have always been Nian Shi Lan's enemies.

58
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,440
Now that she's in their hands

59
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,640
even if she didn't send someone to commit arson

60
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,200
there is enough evidence.

61
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,000
right now

62
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,500
the evidence is concrete.

63
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,300
And you, really, why would you burn yourself?

64
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,100
Thankfully it's still cold out. If it was in the summer

65
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,799
it would definitely fester.

66
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,000
At worse it will leave a scar.

67
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,880
Exchanging it for Nian Shi's life isn't a bad deal.

68
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,800
If the Emperor sees my wounds

69
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,120
only then he will realize how scary a fire can be.

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,040
He will think of

71
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,200
if it had been on your body and how heartbroken he would feel.

72
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,159
Only then he would thoroughly hate Nian Shi Lan.

73
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,200
If she didn't force us to,

74
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,400
I wouldn't realize how ruthless I could be.

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,700
When Nian Shi Lan dies

76
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,520
I don't know who to fight with.

77
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,280
Isn't it easy enough to fight with someone in the Harem?

78
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,849
You can fight anyone.

79
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,840
But it's also simple to not fight.

80
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,900
And let it someone kill you silently without a trace.

81
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,900
New people are always coming in.

82
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,600
Are you worried that the rest of your days will be dull?

83
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,300
I'm just concerned about your injury. Does it hurt?

84
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,800
I'm fine.

85
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,600
When your wound heals

86
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:18,587
I'll give you a soothing balm.

87
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,760
It's the best to remove scars.

88
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,960
Promise Nian is not repentant

89
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,700
and has evil intentions,

90
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,300
she even had the nerve to order her servant Su Xi to burn down Sui Yu Xuan.

91
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,900
Such a cruel act.

92
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,200
I will pass a harsh punishment; suicide.

93
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,200
Otherwise there will be no justice in the Harem.

94
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,800
The Empress is fair in her judgement, we respectfully consent.

95
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Because she served the Emperor for many years,

96
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,440
I will show mercy and allow her to leave a whole corpse.

97
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,800
Jian Qiu. Notify Eunuch Su and prepare poison, a blade, and a white cloth.

98
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,159
And let her choose which way to go.

99
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,500
This will be to remember her for serving the Emperor.

100
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,800
You are merciful. If it was me who saw her do such devious things, I would have

101
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,880
beheaded her to relieve my anger.

102
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,680
You may all sit.

103
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,360
Yes.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,300
Imperial Consort Xiang,

105
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,100
What's wrong?

106
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:29,719
In your reply, I have not been feeling well.

107
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:34,000
I've eaten a lot of medicine but it still isn't better. I apologize for my appearance.

108
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Sit down.

109
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,719
Yes.

110
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:40,679
You must take care of Wen Yi and prepare for the new year.

111
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:44,200
No wonder you are exhausted. You must care for your health.

112
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,700
Empress you spent the night interrogating Su Xi and must be tired.

113
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,719
You should rest today.

114
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,400
I will take my leave first then.

115
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,400
Okay,

116
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,120
You may all leave.

117
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,159
We take our leave.

118
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,920
Jin Xi,

119
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,680
What time did Enuch Su say that he will send miss Nian on her path?

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,280
In the cold palace death sentences are carried out at dusk.

121
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,080
Help me with my hair and makeup . I want to see Madam Hua on her way.

122
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,480
You certainly have the guts.

123
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,320
You even come to the cold palace like this.

124
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,000
I've come to this place more than you.

125
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,300
Back then it was here that I saw Consort Li become crazy.

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,560
You are dreaming again.

127
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,400
You have hurt me to this point.

128
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,240
I won't let you get away with it even if I am a ghost.

129
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,880
No one wants to harm you. You reap what you sow.

130
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:38,200
You drowned Consort Chun, right? You were also the one who put cassava in Princess Wen Yi's food right?

131
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,840
You ordered Consort Yu to poison my food

132
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,400
and pushed Consort Mei into the water.

133
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Wrongly accusing Consort Mei of faking a pregnancy to get favor.

134
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,719
But you did all of it.

135
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,600
I know.

136
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,360
That evil woman Cao Qing Mo would only stab me in the back with you directing her.

137
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,800
With her ability? She doesn't have the guts.

138
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,200
You really don't understand people.

139
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,040
You used Wen Yi to compete for affection

140
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,840
even to the point when you don't care if you are playing with her life.

141
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,440
Imperial Concubine Xiang is her birth mother!

142
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,794
Why wouldn't she hate you?

143
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:18,680
Did you think that she only recently started to hate you?

144
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:22,719
Three feet of ice doesn't occur in one night.

145
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,520
You should have known earlier that she became unfaithful to you.

146
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:31,439
With my status back then,

147
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,479
even the old hag Empress had to back off.

148
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,040
Cao Qing Mo was only a dog by my side.

149
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,839
Why would I care about her?

150
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,000
Too bad but she is a person.

151
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,600
People are more complicated than dogs.

152
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,720
Wrench. You are as crafty as your father.

153
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,920
If it wasn't your dad who set up that plan

154
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,920
the Nian family wouldn't have been burried.

155
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,880
You became allies

156
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,199
just to ensure that I die?

157
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
If it wasn't the fact that the Nian family became arrogant and prideful after an accomplishment

158
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,959
This wouldn't have happened.

159
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,119
You forgot that your husband is the Emperor.

160
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,700
How can anyone else sleep on the Emperor's bed?

161
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,040
My brother is a meritorious official. For our kingdom he settled the dispute in the northwest.

162
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,760
A military expliot

163
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,880
No matter how much he contributed he is still the Emperor's official.

164
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,680
How can he behave as though he's above the Emperor?

165
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,280
Unless he intended to throw a coup.

166
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,113
Why would you be here?

167
00:10:41,113 --> 00:10:42,360
I came with my miss.

168
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,400
Imperial Concubine Wan is inside?

169
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,720
With the Empress's order's I need to send miss Nian on her way now.

170
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,400
You send her in your way and the miss will see her off in her way.

171
00:10:52,512 --> 00:10:55,073
Quickly go inside so you don't miss the time.

172
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,558
Good fortunes to you madam.

173
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,100
Eunuch Su please rise.

174
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:15,918
Under the Empress's orders

175
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:19,118
Please select one.

176
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:22,838
The Empress's orders?

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,400
Where's the Emperor's imperial order? Bring it.

178
00:11:27,843 --> 00:11:29,909
The Emperor's intentions

179
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,100
are to let the Empress take care of everything.

180
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:36,718
Without the Emperor's orders I refuse to die.

181
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:41,397
The Emperor can personally sentence my brother to death.

182
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:45,037
Why can't he give one to me?

183
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,300
The Emperor said

184
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:49,917
he doesn't want to hear anything about you.

185
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:56,697
The Emperor really despises me to this point?

186
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:07,149
Go ask for his Imperial Order.

187
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:10,012
I'll wait.

188
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:16,260
Eunuch Su, just let it go for now

189
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:20,899
Let me say a few goodbyes to Promise Nian

190
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:24,709
Yes. Please go ahead.

191
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:27,782
I will wait outside.

192
00:12:41,497 --> 00:12:44,738
I'm sorry, I got used to calling you Niang Niang

193
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:48,316
Now to call you Promise

194
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:50,861
is new to me.

195
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:55,817
The heater has cooled, go add some more charcoal.

196
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:58,514
Yes, but staying here by yourself is too dangerous.

197
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:00,946
Just go, if anything happens

198
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:03,299
Eunuch Su and them are outside.

199
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:18,708
The Emperor hates you..

200
00:13:18,738 --> 00:13:22,925
Do you know? The Emperor has never hated me.

201
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:27,341
He used to spoil me.

202
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:31,339
No matter what mistakes I made

203
00:13:31,736 --> 00:13:33,947
how angry he was,

204
00:13:34,718 --> 00:13:37,261
he couldn't stay away from me for too long.

205
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:41,536
The reason why the Emperor likes you, do you know?

206
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:46,342
It's because of your beauty?

207
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:49,741
The palace never is in need of beauties.

208
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:53,904
You are saying that the Emperor spoiled me because I was Niang Geng Yao's sister?

209
00:13:56,739 --> 00:14:00,826
Consort Duan was also a general's daughter. Actually you know very well in your heart.

210
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:04,290
Why do you need to lie to yourself? You're lying!

211
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:07,196
Why wouldn't the Emperor have real feelings for me?

212
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:11,381
Maybe he did. But even if they existed

213
00:14:12,396 --> 00:14:15,100
Nian Geng Yao was domineering for so many years.

214
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,662
These real feelings

215
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:20,409
would have dissipated until there was nothing left.

216
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:23,264
How would a wrench like you know anything?

217
00:14:28,098 --> 00:14:31,581
I remember the year I first entered the lord's estate.

218
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:35,694
and I became a side concubine.

219
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:39,818
I became the Emperor's most loved woman.

220
00:14:41,337 --> 00:14:43,941
The lord's estate had so many women

221
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:47,217
but everyone was afraid of him. Only I wasn't.

222
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:52,215
He brought me to ride horses,

223
00:14:52,262 --> 00:14:55,053
to hunt.

224
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:58,742
He said he only liked me.

225
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:06,142
But there were so many women in the lord's estate.

226
00:15:06,857 --> 00:15:09,496
It made me so angry.

227
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,498
Tonight he would stay at one concubine's place.

228
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:16,978
The next he would stay at a different one's.

229
00:15:17,828 --> 00:15:21,204
Just like that I waited and waited.

230
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:26,073
I waited until it was morning but he still didn't come.

231
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:35,825
Have you tasted the feeling of staying up until morning?

232
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:39,940
I knew he was the Emperor

233
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:45,097
so I knew that at night he never belonged to just me.

234
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:48,886
Of course.

235
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:52,459
You never liked the Emperor like I did.

236
00:15:55,518 --> 00:15:58,184
Then I got pregnant.

237
00:15:58,184 --> 00:16:00,856
The Emperor was really happy.

238
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:05,568
But then he became unhappy.

239
00:16:07,276 --> 00:16:09,775
although he didn't say it

240
00:16:09,816 --> 00:16:12,656
I could tell

241
00:16:13,651 --> 00:16:17,479
that there would only be 3rd prince who grew up in his estate.

242
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:23,031
I knew he was worried.

243
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:25,988
So I said "don't worry"

244
00:16:26,877 --> 00:16:29,877
I will give birth to a prince.

245
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:37,134
But not long after I drank pregnancy medicine given by Consort Duan

246
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:40,181
and I lost my child!

247
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:44,460
The Imperial Doctor told me

248
00:16:44,498 --> 00:16:47,967
that it was already a fetus that became a male.

249
00:16:48,886 --> 00:16:50,969
You lost your kid,

250
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,373
so you had to take my kid to accompany him to death?

251
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:57,714
He was only 4 months old.

252
00:16:57,741 --> 00:16:59,740
Yet you had to sentence him to death

253
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:01,828
I didn't kill your child.

254
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,800
It was because you were pathetic and kneeled for only and hour before having a miscarriage.

255
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
You couldn't keep your own child.

256
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,200
Why do you blame me?

257
00:17:17,383 --> 00:17:20,020
I hated how the Emperor took special notice of you.

258
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,778
I never saw

259
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:25,347
the Emperor spoil a woman so much.

260
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:28,822
With you

261
00:17:28,858 --> 00:17:32,025
The Emperor would not care about me anymore.

262
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:36,066
I didn't want to keep waiting until morning.

263
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:43,266
If any women compete with me for the Emperor's favor

264
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:45,407
they have to die.

265
00:17:45,485 --> 00:17:48,418
I did tell miss Yu to kill you.

266
00:17:49,182 --> 00:17:51,950
But I didn't want to kil your child.

267
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,155
You didn't?

268
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:57,137
Even if you didn't have that intention

269
00:17:57,137 --> 00:17:59,904
but if it wasn't for your "Happily Desirable" incense

270
00:17:59,947 --> 00:18:02,555
why would my body become so weak?

271
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:05,226
And kneel for only an hour before having a miscarriage?

272
00:18:09,418 --> 00:18:12,307
"Happily Desirable" incense

273
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:21,018
Do you know why you never got pregnant after your miscarriage?

274
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:24,226
Did you know that your incense had large amounts of musk?

275
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:28,022
How many years did you use it?

276
00:18:28,062 --> 00:18:30,905
Of course you wouldn't ever have children

277
00:18:30,947 --> 00:18:34,176
You are lying. That incense was a gift from the Emperor.

278
00:18:36,155 --> 00:18:37,936
The Emperor.

279
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,098
No, it can't be.

280
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:46,027
If it wasn't the Emperor's orders

281
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:50,982
why wouldn't any doctors tell you that you had musk in your system?

282
00:18:52,138 --> 00:18:55,653
Which caused you to become unable to become pregnant. Even your miscarriage

283
00:18:56,617 --> 00:18:58,976
was the Emperor's orders.

284
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:03,895
Consort Duan's pregnancy medicine only protected the Emperor's reputation.

285
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:08,387
No matter how much safflower you gave to Consort Duan

286
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:11,302
you won't be able to get your child back.

287
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:16,857
Why? Why?

288
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,784
Because you are Nian's daughter.

289
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:24,019
Niang Geng Yao already had a mutinous intent.

290
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,114
The Emperor wouldn't let you give birth to a child with the Nian bloodline.

291
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:57,181
Emperor!

292
00:19:58,058 --> 00:20:00,226
Emperor!

293
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:04,296
You have made me suffer from so much.

294
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:40,976
Shi Lan's funeral is completed?

295
00:20:42,134 --> 00:20:44,181
She died in a very cruel manner.

296
00:20:45,053 --> 00:20:48,216
When the Emperor found out he became quiet for a while.

297
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:52,138
In the end he still gave her dignity.

298
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:56,662
He buried her as a Noble Consort and gave her the posthumous name of Dun Su.

299
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:00,900
It's a pity that although she will be buried as a Noble Consort

300
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:05,099
it's almost the new year and there's only grass.

301
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,697
Kind hearted... When was she ever kind hearted?

302
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,578
The people will think it is irony when they hear it.

303
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:17,061
No matter if it is sarcasm or praise.

304
00:21:17,662 --> 00:21:20,017
Although when she died she was only a "promise"

305
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:22,947
But the Emperor

306
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,800
still gave her face after her death.

307
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,700
When she was alive she didn't get any.

308
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:32,061
Dignity given after death is only for the living people to see.

309
00:21:33,012 --> 00:21:37,342
The reason why the Emperor did this was so no one would doubt his reputation.

310
00:21:37,895 --> 00:21:40,337
And save some face for himself.

311
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:43,181
Jie jie sees this clearly

312
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,500
How can I not? Right now the only ones getting affection

313
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,700
are you and Precious Qi.

314
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,099
You guys are monopolizing the best time.

315
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:55,742
So what if we are getting affection during this period of time?

316
00:21:55,784 --> 00:21:58,406
If we are like Nian Shi Lan

317
00:21:58,406 --> 00:22:01,807
and lose our ability to see clearly because of our competition for his love

318
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,000
That is scary.

319
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:07,987
Today you seem to have a mixed feelings toward her.

320
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:11,097
I thought I hated her guts.

321
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:13,708
But now she died,

322
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:16,097
I only feel dreary.

323
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:18,826
When she entered the estate

324
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,869
She never would have imagined that after so many years,

325
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:24,581
she would be plotted against by the person closest to her.

326
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,400
And resulted in today's outcome.

327
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,700
Isn't the palace like this?

328
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:35,100
Plotting to get affection and ranks.

329
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:37,668
What we can calculate,

330
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,000
why can't the Emperor?

331
00:22:39,813 --> 00:22:41,570
If we don't plot can't we live?

332
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:52,941
After I woke up this morning I discovered that the wrinkles by my eyes have deepened.

333
00:22:53,877 --> 00:22:56,048
I remembered my age.

334
00:22:56,431 --> 00:22:59,057
Plotting and plotting

335
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:02,108
for over half my life.

336
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,627
Madam, Imperial Concubine Xiang passed away.

337
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:22,338
Make preparations, I'll be right over.

338
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,961
Let's go.

339
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:32,764
A few days ago I saw that she didn't look too good.

340
00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:35,109
How can she suddenly die?

341
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:40,366
Imperial Doctor secretly told me that the Emperor and Empress Dowager can't keep her.

342
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,581
They told her servants to drug her.

343
00:23:44,537 --> 00:23:47,414
The symptoms of the drug is often sleeptalking

344
00:23:47,414 --> 00:23:50,427
and she was the one who exposed Nian Shi Lan

345
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:54,697
Now that Nian Shi Lan died

346
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:58,216
everyone will think that Imperial Concubine died of grief.

347
00:23:59,057 --> 00:24:02,060
The Empress Dowager told the imperial doctors to keep it quiet.

348
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:04,828
Then can only pretend to be deaf and mute.

349
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:09,105
Cao Qin Mo was good at scheming.

350
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:12,974
But no matter how deep it was it could never compare to the Emperor and Empress Dowager.

351
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,380
To forward herself consort Xiang betrayed consort Hua.

352
00:24:18,337 --> 00:24:20,945
It means that someday she may betray someone else.

353
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,248
Princess Wen Yi is a pitiful child.

354
00:24:25,248 --> 00:24:27,686
She lost her mother.

355
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:42,106
I think

356
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:46,181
If she were to be under your care

357
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,992
she would become very obedient and intelligent.

358
00:24:49,027 --> 00:24:51,741
I don't think the Emperor would have any objections.

359
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:55,858
I really like Princess Wen Yi, but this kind of thing

360
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:58,900
isn't something we can be in charge of.

361
00:24:58,927 --> 00:25:02,389
You love her so much you would treat her as though she is your real child.

362
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,808
I am willing to help you.

363
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:09,065
If so

364
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:12,775
I will give her everthing that I can.

365
00:25:22,217 --> 00:25:24,947
The wound has healed,

366
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:28,155
but from the wound's appearance

367
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:32,067
it may reoccur.

368
00:25:32,101 --> 00:25:34,777
Please forgive me for my lack of knowledge.

369
00:25:34,812 --> 00:25:39,217
Don't blame yourself. This has always been the reason why my body is weak.

370
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:42,501
I will have to ask you to come may times.

371
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:46,133
You spoke too seriously. Then I will come tomorrow.

372
00:25:46,741 --> 00:25:48,902
The medicine is already being prepared.

373
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:52,456
Please use it on time. I will take my leave.

374
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:55,181
Imperial Doctor Wen please take care.

375
00:26:04,662 --> 00:26:07,384
Miss, this is a new medicine the Doctor Wen prescribed.

376
00:26:08,898 --> 00:26:11,708
This is too bitter, bring some honey.

377
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:13,380
Yes.

378
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,022
What's wrong?

379
00:26:35,936 --> 00:26:38,177
Why doesn't the wound seem to be healing?

380
00:26:38,211 --> 00:26:42,058
Thankfully it is winter. If it was hot then it would probably become inflamed.

381
00:26:43,422 --> 00:26:46,060
You are already being very careful with your diet.

382
00:26:46,098 --> 00:26:49,069
You don't eat fish or shrimp. But...

383
00:26:49,101 --> 00:26:51,969
My health has always been weak.

384
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:55,159
Maybe if I have medicine for a few more days it will become better.

385
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:58,211
It's late, we should sleep.

386
00:27:00,061 --> 00:27:02,979
I don't know why, but recently I am always feeling tired.

387
00:27:03,027 --> 00:27:06,017
Jiejie should also sleep.

388
00:27:14,148 --> 00:27:17,177
These western expedition essays were found when we were taking things from Nian Geng Yao's estate.

389
00:27:17,206 --> 00:27:20,097
They weren't seen as very valuable

390
00:27:20,148 --> 00:27:22,219
so they were just found.

391
00:27:22,268 --> 00:27:24,858
From what I have seen, the writings are all treasonous.

392
00:27:25,502 --> 00:27:27,937
I brought it here immediately for your Majesty to handle.

393
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:41,619
I have sentenced Nian Geng Yao to death.

394
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,217
It is not just that.

395
00:27:47,271 --> 00:27:49,578
Inside it refers to history using his name to keep track of years.

396
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:52,138
It says that your Majesty's name for the year isn't good.

397
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,063
The Emperor is only mediocre and is jealous of Nian Geng Yao's skills

398
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,021
And in the future would definitely dispose of Nian Geng Yao.

399
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:10,181
Insolent.

400
00:28:10,937 --> 00:28:13,023
Please calm down your Majesty.

401
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:18,846
Who wrote this book?

402
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:23,050
Nian Geng Yao's Chief of staff Wang Jing Qi.

403
00:28:25,498 --> 00:28:27,888
It is treacherous and heresy.

404
00:28:28,697 --> 00:28:30,939
If this book is spread through the villages,

405
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:33,147
My honorable name

406
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:36,097
will be ruined by this villain.

407
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:39,015
Please calm down.

408
00:28:43,062 --> 00:28:45,059
Send an order.

409
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,357
Wang's female family members

410
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:01,086
will be sent to Pi Jia Ren as servants.

411
00:29:01,145 --> 00:29:04,579
The males will be sent to Ning Gu Ta.

412
00:29:04,621 --> 00:29:07,066
As for his relatives, any who are in the government will be removed.

413
00:29:07,076 --> 00:29:09,921
I cannot allow these kind of people

414
00:29:09,941 --> 00:29:13,023
to leave their legacy.

415
00:29:13,023 --> 00:29:15,462
Your official accepts the order.

416
00:29:17,176 --> 00:29:19,538
The Emperor's fury

417
00:29:19,587 --> 00:29:22,103
scared me so much I was sweating.

418
00:29:24,504 --> 00:29:26,607
The Emperor truly cannot accept him.

419
00:29:26,657 --> 00:29:28,737
However,

420
00:29:28,796 --> 00:29:31,658
although Wang Jing Qi is at fault

421
00:29:31,707 --> 00:29:34,738
and deserves death,

422
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:37,697
Hanging his head

423
00:29:37,697 --> 00:29:39,886
in front of the market for ten years...

424
00:29:39,937 --> 00:29:42,357
Aiya.

425
00:29:42,377 --> 00:29:44,670
Think about how this situation

426
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:48,139
will make so many peasants tremble.

427
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:53,466
It seems as though brother Zhen doesn't support his Majesty's punshiment.

428
00:29:53,497 --> 00:29:56,185
Brother E Min don't joke around.

429
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,181
His Majesty is wise how can I not support it?

430
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:02,085
It's just that Nian Geng Yao's is already dead

431
00:30:02,137 --> 00:30:05,282
but the Emperor still punishes his assistant so harshly.

432
00:30:05,301 --> 00:30:10,006
It feels that the Imperial Court

433
00:30:10,735 --> 00:30:13,058
has an unsettling feeling.

434
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:16,428
This unsettling feeling

435
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:19,072
Is as a result of both of our work, right?

436
00:30:19,101 --> 00:30:22,042
Of course. Tang Ke has committed a crime.

437
00:30:25,351 --> 00:30:28,069
But his entire family will be involved.

438
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:32,860
It's a pity.

439
00:30:33,697 --> 00:30:35,490
Brother Zhen,

440
00:30:35,538 --> 00:30:38,056
I've heard that Qi Pan street has a lot of

441
00:30:38,115 --> 00:30:41,097
nice paintings and books. Shall we go take a look?

442
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:43,327
I was just thinking about going.

443
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:45,702
E Min should we go together now?

444
00:30:45,702 --> 00:30:48,509
Today before I left my wife told me to go home earlier.

445
00:30:49,468 --> 00:30:52,779
If you see something good you must tell me

446
00:30:52,835 --> 00:30:55,067
Definitely, definitely.

447
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:17,747
Greetings to Imperial Concubine Wan and Precious Hui.

448
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:20,885
Madam, the Emperor has ordered

449
00:31:20,885 --> 00:31:23,183
you to go to the Hall of Mental Cultivation in a bit.

450
00:31:23,218 --> 00:31:24,914
I know.

451
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:27,708
Then today we should stop.

452
00:31:27,747 --> 00:31:30,627
Tomorrow we can continue playing. You should prepare yourself

453
00:31:30,661 --> 00:31:32,779
So you don't make the Emperor wait.

454
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:34,261
Okay.

455
00:31:42,574 --> 00:31:45,499
Oh yeah Cai Yue. Why hasn't Doctor Wen come to take my pulse today?

456
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:48,564
You go take a look and see what's going on.

457
00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:51,943
Doctor Wen always comes before dinner, not this early.

458
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:56,178
So in the end,

459
00:31:56,193 --> 00:31:58,678
It was because I remembered the wrong time.

460
00:32:02,146 --> 00:32:04,177
The Official's report says

461
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,362
That I use his wife's life to threaten him.

462
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:23,506
Now that he is arrested no wonder he would blame you.

463
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:27,190
How do you plan on handling it?

464
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:35,847
What you do is understandable.

465
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:38,632
After all, Yun E is a traitor.

466
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:40,337
Killing him is necessary.

467
00:32:41,937 --> 00:32:44,057
You were mad today,

468
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:46,502
due to Yun E's treasonous words right?

469
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,537
Huan Huan

470
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:53,573
I am more concerned with what the public thinks of me.

471
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:59,314
Then your majesty,

472
00:33:30,061 --> 00:33:32,792
Then I will send an order

473
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:42,708
Your Majesty.

474
00:33:46,286 --> 00:33:49,268
Your Majesty needs to go.

475
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,709
I know. I will go there in a bit.

476
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:54,488
Yes.

477
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,914
Then I will take my leave first.

478
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:15,984
Today marks seven days after consort Hua's death.

479
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,341
She's already dead.

480
00:34:19,377 --> 00:34:21,592
Why do you bring it up?

481
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:25,509
Since I witnessed Shi Lan's death,

482
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:28,377
I don't know why

483
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:30,942
but I feel uneasy.

484
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,828
Sometimes I would be speaking to the Emperor

485
00:34:33,857 --> 00:34:36,741
when suddenly her face would appear in front of me.

486
00:34:40,759 --> 00:34:43,217
I don't know if I will end up like her.

487
00:34:45,277 --> 00:34:47,775
Miss Shi doesn't have a son.

488
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:51,016
But if you have one,

489
00:34:51,016 --> 00:34:53,126
your status will definitely be stable.

490
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:55,937
It's not that easy to have one whenever.

491
00:34:56,525 --> 00:34:58,773
Doctor Wen has been prescribing medicine and I've been eating it.

492
00:34:58,864 --> 00:35:01,019
But there is nothing. <br> How about

493
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:05,057
we go to the peasants and get some home remedies.

494
00:35:05,096 --> 00:35:07,532
Maybe it would be more effective than the Imperial Doctors'.

495
00:35:08,124 --> 00:35:10,045
When you get married,

496
00:35:10,045 --> 00:35:12,386
I wonder if you will still speak of nonsense.

497
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:14,975
I am thinking of ideas for you.

498
00:35:15,009 --> 00:35:17,140
If my idea isn't good then that's fine.

499
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,167
But you are making fun of me.

500
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:21,227
What teasing?

501
00:35:21,268 --> 00:35:23,538
In about a year,

502
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,020
you won't be by my side serving me anymore.

503
00:35:26,618 --> 00:35:28,817
Unless you were going to stay with my forever.

504
00:35:31,617 --> 00:35:33,537
Miss,

505
00:35:33,571 --> 00:35:36,538
Let me be honest.

506
00:35:36,549 --> 00:35:38,814
I don't want to get married.

507
00:35:41,498 --> 00:35:43,739
I only want to stay with you forever.

508
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,540
In here everything is good

509
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:49,136
but everything isn't good.

510
00:35:50,295 --> 00:35:52,778
Miss suffering it by herself

511
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:55,955
is too tiring.

512
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,770
You are talking nonsense again.

513
00:36:00,102 --> 00:36:02,310
If you wait until you are an old girl

514
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:04,659
then you really won't be able to get married.

515
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:12,017
Miss Wan Bi today is my turn.

516
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:15,701
Liu Ju is waiting for you to go to sleep.

517
00:36:16,337 --> 00:36:20,559
Madam Mei is already resting,

518
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:24,020
You should also hurry and rest. I will go now.

519
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,020
Today at the Yang Xin Palace Miss why did you

520
00:36:32,086 --> 00:36:34,179
ask for mercy for Lord Duan's son?

521
00:36:36,018 --> 00:36:38,337
Back when I lost affection and my child

522
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:40,651
The palace had so many people but

523
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:42,674
besides Consort Jing and Mei

524
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,947
There was only Lord Dun who came to see me.

525
00:36:46,697 --> 00:36:48,307
Miss your heart is kind.

526
00:36:48,337 --> 00:36:50,386
This is your repayment for the small favor from years ago.

527
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:53,174
Lord Dun is arrogant and domineering.

528
00:36:53,941 --> 00:36:56,298
But to his wife and kids

529
00:36:56,328 --> 00:36:59,256
he would be willing to lose his life to protect them.

530
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:02,114
Although he has made many mistakes

531
00:37:02,141 --> 00:37:04,537
he isn't a bad husband.

532
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:23,136
Good fortunes to your Majesty, good fortunes Empress.

533
00:37:23,182 --> 00:37:25,344
Hurry and rise. <br> Thank you your Majesty

534
00:37:26,415 --> 00:37:28,913
Jie Jie came late. Your punishment is that after you peel the walnuts

535
00:37:28,941 --> 00:37:31,016
you cannot eat them yourself.

536
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,908
It's cold outside so I used a hand warmer. Halfway here

537
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:35,971
it became cold so I went back to get another one.

538
00:37:36,022 --> 00:37:37,757
Thus it resulted in my late arrival.

539
00:37:41,617 --> 00:37:43,392
It's indeed cold. Hurry and warm up.

540
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:45,151
Eat some of the food. <br> Thank you your Majesty.

541
00:37:45,176 --> 00:37:46,897
Of course.

542
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:48,600
Otherwise if you eat it cold

543
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:50,426
your stomach won't feel good.

544
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,717
Thank you Niang Niang.

545
00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:55,363
Your Majesty,

546
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:57,667
Right now there are many open spots for the Imperial Harem.

547
00:37:57,703 --> 00:37:59,867
Are you going to select some sisters

548
00:37:59,893 --> 00:38:01,581
fill the empty spaces?

549
00:38:01,617 --> 00:38:03,461
Continue speaking.

550
00:38:03,508 --> 00:38:05,227
According to the Harem's guidelines,

551
00:38:05,261 --> 00:38:07,643
there should be one imperial noble consort, two noble consorts, four consorts,

552
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:10,107
six imperial concubines, and the rest are unlimited.

553
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:12,176
Right now of the consorts

554
00:38:12,217 --> 00:38:14,337
there are Consort Duan, Consort Jing, and Consort Qi.

555
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:16,498
Regarding imperial concubines there is only Imperial Concubine Wan.

556
00:38:16,537 --> 00:38:18,307
There aren't enough people.

557
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,666
The imperial noble consort and noble consort are of no worries.

558
00:38:20,702 --> 00:38:22,805
Of the consorts

559
00:38:22,857 --> 00:38:24,737
we could add someone.

560
00:38:24,788 --> 00:38:26,881
Choose a good date

561
00:38:26,901 --> 00:38:28,827
and Imperial Concubine Wan will become a consort.

562
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,298
My qualifications are low.

563
00:38:34,326 --> 00:38:36,149
This isn't a matter of qualifying.

564
00:38:36,176 --> 00:38:38,417
Imperial Concubine Wan has wonderful virtues.

565
00:38:38,462 --> 00:38:41,673
Naturally you should become a consort. But you came in the palace late

566
00:38:41,707 --> 00:38:43,725
and don't have any sons.

567
00:38:43,787 --> 00:38:45,827
In the future if you bear a son

568
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:48,048
that would be the best time

569
00:38:48,048 --> 00:38:50,136
to become a consort. <br> -It doesn't matter.

570
00:38:50,181 --> 00:38:53,054
She will become Consort Wan.

571
00:38:53,096 --> 00:38:55,748
The second of the second month is a good date.

572
00:38:57,817 --> 00:39:00,777
Thank you your Majesty, thank you Empress.

573
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:03,062
Rise. <br> Congratulations Jie Jie

574
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,977
You are busy congratulating Imperial Concubine Wan, how do you know you don't have good news?

575
00:39:09,372 --> 00:39:12,036
Precious An will become Imperial Concubine An.

576
00:39:13,246 --> 00:39:16,617
Then choose a good date for those two.

577
00:39:16,617 --> 00:39:19,587
So the sisters can have the same good fortune.

578
00:39:19,621 --> 00:39:23,250
In addition, Lingering Xin has been serving me for a long time.

579
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,868
She will become Precious Xin.

580
00:39:28,377 --> 00:39:30,627
Thank your your Majesty.

581
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:32,938
Thank you Empress.

582
00:39:32,975 --> 00:39:35,912
Thank you jie jei. <br> - Congratulations mei mei.

583
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:38,171
Rise. <br> - Thank you Emperor.

584
00:39:38,257 --> 00:39:40,979
It's still early.

585
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:43,337
I will go look at some reports.

586
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,581
Imperial Concubine Wan will come with me

587
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:47,975
to help with my ink.

588
00:39:50,332 --> 00:39:51,578
His Majesty is leaving.

589
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:54,652
Sending off his Majesty.
