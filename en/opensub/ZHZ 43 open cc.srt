1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,700
Your Majesty, the Empress has arrived.

2
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:10,940
Greetings, your Majesty.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,600
Come, sit.

4
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:13,822
Yes.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,400
It's late, is there something urgent?

6
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:23,634
Today you left in a hurry

7
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,391
and I forgot to ask.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,900
After New Years is the Lantern Festival.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,300
How do you plan celebrating it this year?

10
00:00:31,316 --> 00:00:35,441
The Empress Dowager has not recovered

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,800
A simple celebration would suffice.

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,600
The Lantern Festival ushers in the new, and your Majesty has rewarded Hongxuan.

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,400
What a good deed.

14
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:49,170
Imperial Concubine Wan reminded me to do that.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,400
She wanted me to bestow mercy on Yun'e's lineage.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,600
I'm not sure if I should speak my mind right now...

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,500
Go ahead.

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,700
Yes.

19
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,190
In regards to what you just told me,

20
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:14,078
Your Majesty, Imperial Concubine Wan enjoys your affection, but sometimes she breaks the rules.

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,500
Haven't you always been fond of Imperial Concubine Wan?

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,000
What's is with you today?

23
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:25,666
It's precisely because I adore her, and also because she was recently promoted, that I feel the need to say this.

24
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:31,949
Your Majesty just said that Imperial Concubine Wan told you to knight Hongxuan

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,900
Although I'm pleased at her generosity

26
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,300
I am also worried that she shouldn't be meddling in court affairs.

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,900
Hongxuan's situation counts as family business.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,400
Of course it's family matters.

29
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:46,587
But Yun'e's treasonous acts concern the country.

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,300
Family matters and country matters are inseparable.

31
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,200
Because Imperial Concubine Wan is compassionate, I fear that she will be used by others

32
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,900
without even realising it

33
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,700
Simply put, Imperial Concubine Wan

34
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,800
and her father have the same intentions?

35
00:02:03,845 --> 00:02:08,535
Both have sympathy towards the people I don't like?

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,800
Imperial Concubine Wan is intelligent and I admire that.

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,100
But when it comes to knowing boundaries and staying in the Harem,

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,800
Noble Lady An and Noble Lady Qi surpass her.

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,500
Noble Lady Qi is quite mature

40
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,670
Noble Lady Qi is a Manchu like us.

41
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,400
But Imperial Concubine Wan is a Han

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,600
she may not share our hearts and minds.

43
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,500
Naturally

44
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,200
It takes time to understand someone. Perhaps Imperial Concubine Wan will be even better.

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,100
Greetings, mother.

46
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,800
Emperor, sit here.

47
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,600
How has your health been, Mother?

48
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,829
Same old, same old.

49
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:11,134
Do you like the new Noble Lady Qi?

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,400
She is the daughter of a meritorious official.

51
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,100
You mustn't leave her in the cold.

52
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,000
I understand.

53
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,375
The Harem and the Imperial Courts are essentially inseparable.

54
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,200
You can handle this dexterously.

55
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,300
I will remember your advice, mother.

56
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,400
With Yun'e as an example

57
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,500
I have been careful in dealing with my meritorious subjects

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,700
I have not conferred too much power on them

59
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,956
As for their daughters

60
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,300
official's daughter

61
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,900
I won't spoil them either

62
00:03:47,358 --> 00:03:48,805
That is good.

63
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,500
Ever since Nian Gengyao's incident

64
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,800
I have been constantly vigilant

65
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,300
I hope Long Keduo...

66
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,800
He would not dare.

67
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,600
I hope so.

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,600
As the Empress Dowager, do you

69
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:18,519
not know what Long Keduo's thinking?

70
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,800
I have known him for dozens of years

71
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,800
and witnessed his devotion to you and your father

72
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,600
Haven't you always said that

73
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,500
concubines shouldn't meddle in court affairs?

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,700
You need not worry about what happens there either

75
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,300
You just take care of yourself

76
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,300
I have affairs to attend to

77
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,100
I shall take my leave now. I will come back again in the evening.

78
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,700
Okay.

79
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,000
I know you are busy. But still you have to take care of your health

80
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:04,636
I understand

81
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,700
His Majesty takes his leave

82
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:17,215
Can you make anything out of the Emperor's words?

83
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:21,381
Do we have to get rid of the rabbit to stop the dog from preying on it?

84
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,900
I made this out last time already.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,700
The Empress Dowager rules over the lands

86
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,200
But you must take care of your health even if your intentions are good. Don't try to take on everything yourself.

87
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,000
Official Long Keduo had a part in subduing general Nian.

88
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:44,600
We all have our own blessings, who else could I look out for?

89
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,100
Zhuxi, go light up my scent for me.

90
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,300
Hasn't this book been banned by his majesty?

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,800
How come there is a copy in Yangxin Palace?

92
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,500
I still read it sometimes

93
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,000
so I know what those traitors are thinking all day

94
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,900
How do you feel about this book?

95
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,700
Just a bunch of sycophants

96
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,500
I have decapitated the author of this book Wang Jingqi and displayed his head to the public

97
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,400
to deter others

98
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,900
Stop, your majesty. It's frightening me.

99
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,300
What are you frightened of?

100
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,100
Wang Jingqi deserves his punishment

101
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,100
but displaying his head to the public

102
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,152
will only scare innocent citizens

103
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,200
I've also heard that

104
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,500
your majesty has exiled his wife and children, and demoted his relatives

105
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,800
How do you feel about it?

106
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,500
Wang JIngqi should be responsible

107
00:06:52,553 --> 00:06:56,883
for his own mistakes, but his family

108
00:06:57,109 --> 00:07:00,395
and distant relatives are innocent

109
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,185
If you are criticised for this, I don't think it's worth it

110
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,100
You're saying that I'm wrong?

111
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,000
How could I dare?

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
I just feel

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,900
if this matter is dealt with mercifully

114
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,200
more people will be grateful towards you

115
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,800
You are such a typical woman

116
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,500
who doesn't understand the brutality and resolution of men

117
00:07:24,363 --> 00:07:26,963
Whoever threatens my throne and kingdom

118
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,100
must be killed with no mercy

119
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,300
otherwise

120
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,900
I would be treating my empire as a joke

121
00:07:36,972 --> 00:07:39,108
Yes, I've misspoken

122
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,400
Suiyu Palace is restored

123
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,900
you can move back in

124
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,600
I feel sorry for Noble Lady Qi

125
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,286
She has to live with Consort Qi, and doesn't get to see your majesty often

126
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,200
I've decided

127
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,600
that it's better if you live in Suiyu Palace alone

128
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,200
It's irritating to have Noble Lady Qi around whenever I pay ou a visit

129
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,000
Then it's decided

130
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,500
In spring

131
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,800
I can have a drink with your majesty in front of all the crab apple flowers

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,700
and I can do the Jinghong dance amongst the pear blossoms

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,100
I can estivate with your majesty in summer

134
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,000
I can ferment sweet olive wine with you in autumn

135
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,400
and watch the dancing snowflakes in winter

136
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,000
I will be with you

137
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:55,001
and you will be with me

138
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,000
I will be with you forever

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,600
Wanwan

140
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,300
Are you there, Wanwan?

141
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,000
Fourth Prince

142
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,800
I'm here

143
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,200
My lady, Noble Lady An

144
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,700
has been waiting for you outside since early morning

145
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,000
For how long?

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,800
2 hours

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,600
I'll hurry up

148
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
so she doesn't have to wait anymore

149
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,700
So early, younger sister. Greetings, elder sister

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,200
I'm waiting for you to accompany me in paying our respects to the Empress

151
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:02,171
I will go to court now

152
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,800
Take care, your majesty

153
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,500
Wanwan, I'll be back tonight

154
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,800
Let's go

155
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,800
You two are early birds

156
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Greetings, Your Majesty

157
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,964
We should be early in paying our respects

158
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,300
You two have just been promoted

159
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,700
it's no wonder you're so much more courteous

160
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,000
It's not surprising that his majesty likes you both

161
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,600
His majesty loves Imperial Concubine Wan more than anyone else

162
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,500
When I was waiting for her this morning,

163
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,400
I was in for quite a surprise

164
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,300
Lingrong!

165
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,800
What are you shy about, elder sister?

166
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,600
Her majesty cares for us

167
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,000
This morning

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,900
I heard his majesty call her by her nickname

169
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:54,033
Wanwan

170
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,800
Your majesty, don't listen to her nonsense

171
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,300
Wanwan, Wanwan...

172
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,000
Wanwan, Wanwan...

173
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,200
Wan is your title

174
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,425
His majesty must have such great love for you to call you this

175
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,900
Look at my big mouth!

176
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,434
Please don't be angry at me

177
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,000
It won't happen again

178
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,700
We are all sisters

179
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:18,617
No harm in telling a joke

180
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I just remembered,

181
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,900
Noble Lady An's promotion ceremony is fairly simple

182
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:24,993
Imperial Concubine Wan, you must bear with her

183
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,600
And something needs to be fixed up about your promotion ceremony gown

184
00:11:29,631 --> 00:11:31,555
When the big day arrives

185
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:34,047
I will get someone to deliver it to you

186
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Thank you, your majesty

187
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,400
What a big scar!

188
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,100
not a pleasant sight

189
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,300
At least the wound is congealed

190
00:11:48,344 --> 00:11:50,358
the pus has stopped flowing

191
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,200
that was terrifying!

192
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,000
This is the wound healing paste Lingrong gave me

193
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,400
It cured my wound from the cat scratch

194
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,100
It is gone!

195
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,600
But your wound is small unlike mine

196
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,241
I have some more, you can use this

197
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,600
I can get Lingrong to mix some more

198
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,100
My Lady, Dr. Wen is here

199
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,300
Invite him in

200
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,300
Yes

201
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,600
You won't even let Dr. Wen take your pulse anymore

202
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:27,756
Now he's bugging me everyday

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,100
What a nice scent!

204
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,900
Greetings, My Ladies

205
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,400
Get up

206
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,600
Dr. Wen knows his manners

207
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:43,197
always so decorous

208
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,100
Stop making fun of him

209
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,000
My Lady, what is that?

210
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,000
This is a paste for healing scars

211
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,500
May I take a look?

212
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,000
Something wrong?

213
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
I've used several tubes already

214
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,000
they seem to be fine

215
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,700
I can't say what the problem is right now

216
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,100
may I take it with me?

217
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,000
Sure, please examine it

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,400
You said Qian Mingshi has an epistolary

219
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,000
like this

220
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:29,781
I just found out from Courtier Zhen

221
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,700
I thought this epistolary was not bad

222
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,600
so I took it home

223
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,200
but I realised

224
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:41,374
Qian Mingshi and Nian Gengyao were both from the Kangxi Emperor era

225
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:43,103
they are closely related

226
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:46,981
Qian Mingshi was a traitor like Nian Gengyao

227
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,900
so his poetry must be subversive too

228
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,412
How does Zhen Yuandao feel about this epistolary?

229
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:58,852
Did he procure it on the streets?

230
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,000
This epistolary has not been published

231
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:05,579
it can only be obtained by Qian's close friends

232
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,458
I found this in Courtier Zhen's home

233
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,300
so it cost me great effort to bring it here

234
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,000
Zhen Yuandao

235
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,000
never engaged with Nian Gengyao

236
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,500
That's a fact I'm aware of

237
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:19,121
Me too

238
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,500
Maybe Courtier Zhen

239
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,700
has only engaged with Qian Mingshi

240
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,600
but not Nian Gengyao

241
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:30,308
But the fact that Zhen owns this epistolary

242
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,454
may be quite significant

243
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:34,443
Tell me

244
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:38,500
This epistolary

245
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,800
contains lines

246
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,500
that flatter

247
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:46,305
Nian Gengyao

248
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Such fawning words

249
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,900
Especially the last two lines, which flatter

250
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,600
your 14th brother Yundi

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,600
and 10th brother Yun'e

252
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,301
whom you have incarcerated

253
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:05,170
You telling me that Zhen possesses this epistolary

254
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,339
because he empathises with Yundi and Yun'e?

255
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:09,843
I don't know

256
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:11,975
whether that is the case

257
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:15,004
but Imperial Concubine Wan has pleaded your majesty

258
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:18,371
to give Yun'e's son a rank

259
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,800
this is well-known throughout the internal palace

260
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,600
Even Noble Lady Qi

261
00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:24,963
from a

262
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:26,665
Emin

263
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:27,902
Yes

264
00:15:27,948 --> 00:15:31,096
You have been gotten along with Zhen Yuandao all along

265
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:35,740
why have you told me all this?

266
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:37,654
Although I'm Zhen's colleague

267
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:39,499
and we get along well

268
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:41,982
but I owe everything to your majesty

269
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,617
to your majesty

270
00:15:43,657 --> 00:15:46,706
which beats any friendship I have

271
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,248
Alright. You may leave.

272
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:00,896
Su Peisheng

273
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:02,195
Yes, your majesty

274
00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:04,686
I want to see Imperial Concubine Wan

275
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes

276
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,900
Actually, I'll pay her a visit myself

277
00:16:12,903 --> 00:16:13,977
Yes

278
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:16,304
Did his majesty say anything to your father

279
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:17,941
after your father spoke with him?

280
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:20,383
From what I hear

281
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:21,935
his majesty didn't say much

282
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,620
after my father spoke with him

283
00:16:23,662 --> 00:16:25,678
Wasn't he even the slightest angry?

284
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:28,193
My father said he couldnt tell

285
00:16:29,742 --> 00:16:32,292
Your majesty, maybe my father

286
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,747
didn't get his point across?

287
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:37,066
His majesty has been paranoid since the Nian Gengyao affair

288
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:39,991
and abhors sympathisers of his enemies

289
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:42,464
Nian Gengyao and Yun'e's paid their price for their

290
00:16:42,464 --> 00:16:44,280
sympathy towards Yunsi and Yuntang

291
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:45,986
Let alone

292
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:49,303
a traitorous official who has just been promoted

293
00:16:49,303 --> 00:16:51,591
But His Majesty did not blame

294
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:52,872
Zhen Yuandao and Imperial Concubine Wan

295
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:55,198
that's precisely my worry

296
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:57,557
I've been with his majesty for dozens of years

297
00:16:57,591 --> 00:16:59,148
I know his temperament best

298
00:16:59,175 --> 00:17:01,031
apart from the Empress Dowager

299
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:03,192
I'm concerned that his majesty will

300
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,189
change his temperament for Imperial Concubine Wan

301
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,552
that would be disastrous!

302
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:08,626
Your majesty, Imperial Concubine Wan will be promoted to Consort soon

303
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:11,254
I know, at such a young age too

304
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,100
I'm getting old and stale

305
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:19,146
I may even have to relinquish my throne

306
00:17:20,503 --> 00:17:22,304
His Majesty is here

307
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:29,033
Greetings, your majesty

308
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:30,185
Get up

309
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,360
Thank you, your majesty

310
00:17:34,507 --> 00:17:38,215
You've just moved back

311
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:39,981
I just wanted to tell you

312
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:42,581
Suiyu Palace is renovated so well

313
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:45,096
it's almost too opulent for me

314
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,176
You will be promoted to the rank of Consort soon

315
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:50,674
you deserve a dwelling

316
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,066
that befits your status

317
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:56,370
Have some tea

318
00:17:58,297 --> 00:18:00,252
I have an epistolary here

319
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:01,976
for you to have a look at

320
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,235
Who is Qian Mingshi?

321
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,799
Just read the poems

322
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:21,870
They're not that amazing

323
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:24,421
You're right, but

324
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:25,887
they are hard to obtain

325
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:28,427
Who would collect them anyway?

326
00:18:28,947 --> 00:18:30,616
Maybe those who enjoy it

327
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,500
or friends of the poet

328
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:35,610
who else?

329
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:39,434
Why are you asking me this?

330
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:41,241
Just curious

331
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:43,828
I regard these poems to be

332
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:46,436
overwhelmingly sycophantic

333
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:49,174
and adulating evil

334
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:52,225
The poet should be stripped of his post

335
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:54,313
and exiled

336
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:59,528
I didn't read them carefully, but

337
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:02,883
I don't see any adulation of evil

338
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,827
The poet was eulogising Yun'e

339
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:12,468
Was it written recently?

340
00:19:13,011 --> 00:19:15,174
Or back in Lord Dun's days?

341
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:17,139
The latter

342
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:22,718
As a lord, he will always have fawning supporters

343
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:26,074
such poems must exist in profusion

344
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:29,789
How should I punish the poet?

345
00:19:31,508 --> 00:19:34,424
I don't dare comment

346
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:36,908
Say whatever you like

347
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:41,034
The times have changed

348
00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:43,788
why not just let it go?

349
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,985
Burning these poems will be enough

350
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:49,904
As for the collector

351
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,184
If your majesty punishes him

352
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,214
people will think of you as a tyrant

353
00:19:55,214 --> 00:19:57,978
It's better if you let it go

354
00:19:58,026 --> 00:20:00,635
to soothe everyone's hearts

355
00:20:04,784 --> 00:20:06,878
Good,

356
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,394
I'll think about it

357
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:15,994
You will be having

358
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:19,104
your promotion ceremony soon

359
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:23,299
Have a rest, I will visit Noble Lady Qi

360
00:20:32,744 --> 00:20:34,986
Take care, your majesty

361
00:20:51,408 --> 00:20:54,589
Congratulations, Consort Wan

362
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:57,207
Get up please. Thank you, my lady.

363
00:20:57,985 --> 00:21:01,707
Give the master of ceremony some gifts

364
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:09,355
My lady, you must go receive your instructions from the Empress

365
00:21:09,382 --> 00:21:11,733
and thank his majesty too

366
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:14,108
The master of ceremonies has told me

367
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:16,898
Liuzhu, get my gown.

368
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:19,028
Right away.

369
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,785
Spread it out, how exquisite

370
00:21:29,793 --> 00:21:33,224
Oh no!

371
00:21:33,265 --> 00:21:36,424
I can't turn up with a torn gown!

372
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,502
If I get caught this will be a deception and insult to his majesty

373
00:21:41,629 --> 00:21:44,293
Where's Manager Jiang from the Internal Affairs Department?

374
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,633
Just outside

375
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:50,182
Hurry!

376
00:21:55,434 --> 00:21:57,309
Manager Jiang

377
00:21:57,344 --> 00:21:59,506
Look

378
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:04,183
It's my mistake, please punish me

379
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:07,713
Manager Jiang, this gown from the Internal Affairs Department is torn

380
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:10,334
you can't escape responsibility

381
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:13,192
But I need your help

382
00:22:13,224 --> 00:22:16,588
to resolve this dilemma

383
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:19,652
My lady, this gown

384
00:22:19,652 --> 00:22:22,109
is woven from gold and silver threads

385
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,104
there are not enough threads to tailor another one

386
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:29,030
We will have to open the warehouse

387
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:33,109
if it needs to get fixed, which may take two to three days

388
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,914
What? There's no time!

389
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:39,269
I have to pay my respects to his majesty right away

390
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:41,985
My Lady, we can't stall any longer

391
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:44,818
If we are late we will get blamed.

392
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:51,462
My lady, I have a plan

393
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,876
What is it?

394
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:56,144
A few days ago the Empress brought over a gown

395
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:58,700
that resembles the promotion ceremony gown

396
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,012
Although it's not as identical as this

397
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:03,865
it will have to do

398
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:06,868
Are you sure?

399
00:23:06,912 --> 00:23:09,390
The style of that gown is old

400
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:12,079
it was probably worn by the Empress previously

401
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:15,869
It's been left there for 2 days

402
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:19,059
it's our only option.

403
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:22,394
Then go get it!

404
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,035
Yes

405
00:23:35,108 --> 00:23:37,668
Although this gown is old

406
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,868
it is still resplendent

407
00:23:39,914 --> 00:23:41,869
Let's hurry.

408
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:44,772
This gown does fit you well.

409
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:47,466
but it looks so familiar

410
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,506
Like I've seen it somewhere before

411
00:23:51,506 --> 00:23:52,940
Really?

412
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,708
No time to worry about that, let's go.

413
00:23:58,623 --> 00:24:00,830
My headache's bothering me again

414
00:24:00,864 --> 00:24:03,384
it's all my fault

415
00:24:03,427 --> 00:24:06,481
I don't want to hold everybody up

416
00:24:06,516 --> 00:24:08,985
No worries, you can go when you're feeling better

417
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:12,474
Your Majesties

418
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:14,825
Consort Wan has arrived.

419
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:17,425
You go first, your majesty

420
00:24:17,452 --> 00:24:19,547
I will be right behind you

421
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:22,183
Sure.

422
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:39,249
Wanwan

423
00:24:43,344 --> 00:24:45,573
Greetings, your majesty

424
00:24:47,372 --> 00:24:50,037
Wanwan, why don't you call me Fourth Prince anymore?

425
00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:58,656
Fourth Prince

426
00:25:00,224 --> 00:25:01,836
Wanwan!

427
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:24,345
Wanwan, you're finally back.

428
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:40,194
I, Zhen Huan, pay my respects

429
00:25:40,214 --> 00:25:42,149
to your majesty

430
00:25:49,436 --> 00:25:51,384
It's you?

431
00:25:57,949 --> 00:26:00,193
Greetings, your majesty

432
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,094
Where did you get that gown?

433
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:06,347
How dare you!

434
00:26:08,055 --> 00:26:09,583
Your majesty

435
00:26:11,732 --> 00:26:13,945
What on earth happened?

436
00:26:13,981 --> 00:26:16,068
Huichun!

437
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:18,979
A few days back, her majesty was going through

438
00:26:19,024 --> 00:26:20,913
the late Empress Chunyuan's old clothes

439
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:23,302
and found that this gown needed repairing

440
00:26:23,346 --> 00:26:25,589
as the buttons were loose

441
00:26:25,654 --> 00:26:28,086
so I took it to the Internal Affairs Department

442
00:26:28,104 --> 00:26:30,765
I wanted to bring it back

443
00:26:30,796 --> 00:26:33,628
but I

444
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:36,272
was too busy

445
00:26:37,686 --> 00:26:40,225
I don't know why Consort Wan

446
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:42,585
is wearing this gown right now

447
00:26:43,241 --> 00:26:46,024
Please forgive me, your majesties

448
00:26:46,465 --> 00:26:48,496
Useless!

449
00:26:48,496 --> 00:26:50,953
How many times do I have to tell you

450
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:53,193
Chunyuan's belongings need to be well cared for

451
00:26:53,234 --> 00:26:55,259
but you've been ignoring me!

452
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:57,308
And especially

453
00:26:57,308 --> 00:26:59,384
this gown

454
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:05,545
This was the gown Chunyuan was wearing the first time we met

455
00:27:06,983 --> 00:27:08,950
Your majesty

456
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:10,887
don't you?

457
00:27:10,907 --> 00:27:13,112
don't you?

458
00:27:13,742 --> 00:27:16,744
Of course I do. Remove it.

459
00:27:26,153 --> 00:27:28,303
I'm so careless

460
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:32,335
but this was an accident

461
00:27:33,168 --> 00:27:35,109
Consort Wan is a meticulous person

462
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:37,505
she couldn't have done it purposefully

463
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:40,154
Why?

464
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:45,104
Just before I got here

465
00:27:45,145 --> 00:27:47,816
I found my ceremony gown torn

466
00:27:48,428 --> 00:27:50,864
so I borrowed this one

467
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:53,947
I don't know the history behind it

468
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:58,304
Please forgive me, your majesty

469
00:27:58,304 --> 00:28:01,145
I don't want to offend (the late) Empress Chunyuan

470
00:28:01,778 --> 00:28:04,024
Consort Wan, she...

471
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:06,130
Consort?

472
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:09,066
Although the ceremony is over

473
00:28:09,103 --> 00:28:12,146
she hasn't received your instructions, so she hasn't been promoted yet

474
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:16,514
Suiyu Palace has been revamped

475
00:28:16,538 --> 00:28:18,627
Go back and think about what you've done

476
00:28:42,152 --> 00:28:44,115
The Emperor orders

477
00:28:47,344 --> 00:28:49,552
that Suiyu Palace will be closed off

478
00:28:49,586 --> 00:28:52,025
No one shall enter or leave

479
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:55,395
Who are you? What do you want?

480
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,939
Manager Jiang has been executed

481
00:28:58,461 --> 00:29:01,264
I am the new manager of the Internal Affairs Authority

482
00:29:01,296 --> 00:29:03,543
Close the doors!

483
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:08,745
What are you doing?

484
00:29:09,268 --> 00:29:11,874
Whoever disobeys orders

485
00:29:11,912 --> 00:29:14,344
will be executed too. Yes, Manager Gou

486
00:29:14,394 --> 00:29:16,118
Shh!

487
00:29:16,146 --> 00:29:18,838
don't startle Imperial Concubine Wan

488
00:29:20,435 --> 00:29:22,878
What should we do?

489
00:29:31,385 --> 00:29:33,188
My lady

490
00:29:36,578 --> 00:29:39,252
He's sealed off Suiyu Palace, hasn't he?

491
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,116
Yes

492
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,674
Don't be too sad

493
00:29:48,716 --> 00:29:51,464
it's not good for your health

494
00:29:52,907 --> 00:29:55,983
At least

495
00:29:55,983 --> 00:29:58,225
it's quiet now

496
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:01,588
I feel guilty that you have

497
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:03,985
to bear all this with me

498
00:30:04,013 --> 00:30:06,463
No, my lady.

499
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:11,280
Jinxi,

500
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:15,212
I once asked you

501
00:30:15,802 --> 00:30:18,630
why are you loyal to me?

502
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:22,314
You said it was fate.

503
00:30:23,692 --> 00:30:26,181
Can you tell me the truth now?

504
00:30:28,663 --> 00:30:31,424
It's because I look like Empress Chunyuan

505
00:30:33,305 --> 00:30:35,534
right?

506
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:42,784
There is some resemblance

507
00:30:42,784 --> 00:30:45,145
but not much

508
00:30:46,517 --> 00:30:48,235
Really?

509
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:52,407
Now I know

510
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,066
why Consort Duan

511
00:30:57,423 --> 00:31:00,026
was so shocked to see me the first time.

512
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,903
And said what she said.

513
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:06,864
She was the first concubine to enter the palace

514
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:11,109
and is familiar with Empress Chunyuan's visage

515
00:31:12,148 --> 00:31:14,824
50 percent resemblance in both appearance and personality

516
00:31:15,388 --> 00:31:17,665
has won his majesty's heart

517
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:19,985
50 percent resemblance

518
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:22,376
in appearance and personality...

519
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,355
is enough to win your loyalty too, right?

520
00:31:29,145 --> 00:31:31,063
No,

521
00:31:31,092 --> 00:31:34,514
your loyalty lies with Empress Chunyuan

522
00:31:35,387 --> 00:31:37,185
My Lady

523
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,898
that's not true

524
00:31:41,114 --> 00:31:44,193
I didn't have the fortune to serve Empress Chunyuan

525
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:49,024
but I was lucky enough to win her compassion on one occasion

526
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:54,579
And you, my lady, only resemble her

527
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:57,057
when you put on her gown

528
00:31:57,628 --> 00:32:00,025
Empress Chunyuan was too innocent and kind

529
00:32:00,062 --> 00:32:03,023
And so are you, my lady

530
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,984
previously

531
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:09,878
my loyalty to you was

532
00:32:09,915 --> 00:32:14,074
partially influenced by Empress Chunyuan's benevolence

533
00:32:14,514 --> 00:32:17,424
But after that, it was all about you.

534
00:32:17,473 --> 00:32:19,905
But I have been forsaken

535
00:32:21,584 --> 00:32:25,008
and may never be loved again

536
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,228
Your loyalty is futile.

537
00:32:31,853 --> 00:32:34,354
My lady, today's incident is

538
00:32:34,393 --> 00:32:36,547
partially my fault.

539
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:39,933
I knew the gown looked familiar, but I had no idea

540
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:42,278
that it belonged to Empress Chunyuan.

541
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:45,106
And Manager Jiang had never served

542
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:48,068
Empress Chunyuan. It looks like

543
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:50,773
we've fallen into someone's trap.

544
00:32:50,773 --> 00:32:53,488
Unfortunately, Manager Jiang

545
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,880
has already been executed.

546
00:32:55,908 --> 00:32:57,944
I'm responsible

547
00:32:57,993 --> 00:33:00,502
for his death too.

548
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,109
He's just another pawn in this scheming chess game.

549
00:33:10,308 --> 00:33:11,870
Jinxi, I shouldn't have

550
00:33:11,905 --> 00:33:14,557
doubted you.

551
00:33:15,924 --> 00:33:18,189
Even if Empress Chunyuan is the reason

552
00:33:18,824 --> 00:33:20,949
behind your loyalty

553
00:33:20,984 --> 00:33:23,226
But his majesty...

554
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:28,148
Oh Empress,

555
00:33:29,237 --> 00:33:31,987
you scheming devil

556
00:33:32,452 --> 00:33:34,624
How do you know, my lady?

557
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:38,074
If it weren't for her

558
00:33:38,713 --> 00:33:41,187
who else would have Empress Chunyuan's clothes?

559
00:33:41,757 --> 00:33:44,255
How could there be such a coincidence?

560
00:33:45,053 --> 00:33:47,469
I was oblivious to the dangers behind me

561
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:52,305
otherwise I wouldn't have become a pawn in the Empress' chess game

562
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,445
You've always been loyal to her

563
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:59,349
but your rapid promotion

564
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:02,031
has made her concerned.

565
00:34:03,233 --> 00:34:05,430
I've lost his majesty's love

566
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:08,228
and the Empress despises me

567
00:34:09,836 --> 00:34:12,116
and this affair concerns Empress Chunyuan

568
00:34:13,504 --> 00:34:16,046
which is His Majesty's deepest wound

569
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,226
It seems

570
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:21,585
that this disaster is irreversible

571
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,995
We can only wait.

572
00:34:24,906 --> 00:34:26,824
Wait?

573
00:34:30,012 --> 00:34:31,993
for what?

574
00:34:33,476 --> 00:34:36,064
This is just like being in the Cold Palace

575
00:34:37,527 --> 00:34:39,065
My Lady

576
00:34:40,382 --> 00:34:42,704
His Majesty once sought to protect me

577
00:34:43,425 --> 00:34:45,995
from the palace conflicts

578
00:34:46,027 --> 00:34:48,440
by despatching me to Penglai Island

579
00:34:48,464 --> 00:34:51,065
Such affection

580
00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:54,467
And look at

581
00:34:54,514 --> 00:34:57,092
where I am today

582
00:35:01,688 --> 00:35:03,271
Whatever

583
00:35:03,306 --> 00:35:04,994
whatever...

584
00:35:08,277 --> 00:35:10,101
Wanwan

585
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:13,745
I am only a substitute

586
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,274
for Empress Chunyuan

587
00:35:30,104 --> 00:35:32,864
Your Majesty, you haven't eaten all evening

588
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:35,264
Have some tea

589
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,923
How dare you!

590
00:35:43,394 --> 00:35:45,264
All of you!

591
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:53,184
Tell the Internal Affairs Department, Imperial Consort Wan

592
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:55,662
shall only receive the salary of a Second Class Attendant. Yes.

593
00:36:06,453 --> 00:36:08,995
Your Majesty, is this comfortable?

594
00:36:09,023 --> 00:36:12,537
I heard that His Majesty threw a fit in Yangxin Palace

595
00:36:12,591 --> 00:36:14,938
And so he should.

596
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:17,309
Imperial Concubine Wan,

597
00:36:17,345 --> 00:36:19,793
his sweetheart, has committed an unforgivable fault

598
00:36:19,852 --> 00:36:22,468
How could His Majesty not get mad?

599
00:36:22,504 --> 00:36:26,112
It's only over a gown though.

600
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:28,991
Empress Chunyuan is the most important person to His Majesty

601
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:32,266
and on account of Noble Lady's Qi's father's words to his Majesty previously

602
00:36:32,344 --> 00:36:35,674
His Majesty was already furious with Imperial Concubine Wan

603
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:42,909
Oh sister, you're such a good sister

604
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:45,766
you can still help me

605
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:48,106
so many years after your death.

606
00:36:48,194 --> 00:36:50,467
And protect me.

607
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:55,227
It seems that Imperial Concubine Wan is doomed.

608
00:36:56,269 --> 00:36:58,585
But Manager Jiang was innocent.

609
00:36:58,662 --> 00:37:01,544
Those who know too much have short lives.

610
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:06,238
Your majesty, I will give you my

611
00:37:06,281 --> 00:37:08,746
unswerving loyalty.

612
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,263
I know, get up.

613
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:12,868
Yes.

614
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:19,746
Imperial Concubine Wan has been locked up.

615
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,559
I'm worried that his Majesty's fury

616
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:25,699
may only be transient.

617
00:37:25,754 --> 00:37:27,848
If His Majesty forgives her

618
00:37:27,907 --> 00:37:30,189
your efforts would go down the drain.

619
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,631
Even if she is forgiven,

620
00:37:32,675 --> 00:37:35,036
Imperial Concubine Wan will have lost her affection for His Majesty.

621
00:37:36,024 --> 00:37:38,143
She's a strong, proud woman.

622
00:37:38,185 --> 00:37:40,663
If she learns that she was only

623
00:37:40,702 --> 00:37:42,944
a substitute all these years

624
00:37:42,981 --> 00:37:45,303
how could she bear it?

625
00:37:46,784 --> 00:37:48,618
Your plan

626
00:37:48,618 --> 00:37:51,345
has no doubt worked.

627
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,022
I admire your wisdom.

628
00:37:57,514 --> 00:37:59,823
Your Majesty, Noble Lady Hui is here to see you

629
00:37:59,871 --> 00:38:01,663
for Imperial Concubine Wan?

630
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:03,949
Probably, she's distraught.

631
00:38:03,978 --> 00:38:06,193
Tell her to leave.

632
00:38:06,228 --> 00:38:07,519
Yes, your Majesty.

633
00:38:16,821 --> 00:38:18,349
Noble Lady Hui,

634
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:21,169
Her Majesty has a headache

635
00:38:21,185 --> 00:38:23,261
Then please let me know

636
00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:24,989
when she gets better!

637
00:38:25,028 --> 00:38:27,783
I will

638
00:38:27,826 --> 00:38:29,858
certainly let you know.

639
00:38:35,024 --> 00:38:37,148
Caiyue, take me to Shoukang Palace

640
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,595
My Lady,

641
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:40,909
the Empress Dowager is asleep at this hour

642
00:38:40,953 --> 00:38:43,674
Both His Majesty and the Empress refuse to see me

643
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:46,462
If I don't see the Empress Dowager, what else can I do?

644
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:50,071
She's quite ill, you'd better not disturb her.

645
00:38:50,556 --> 00:38:53,673
It's cold outside, let's go tomorrow.

646
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:56,224
I don't care, take me to Shoukang Palace.

647
00:38:56,865 --> 00:38:58,060
My Lady...

648
00:39:12,214 --> 00:39:14,104
Is the Empress Dowager asleep?

649
00:39:14,148 --> 00:39:17,152
No, but she's too busy to see you.

650
00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:20,197
Why? She doesn't want to?

651
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,514
Please ask her for me again.

652
00:39:24,419 --> 00:39:26,543
The Empress Dowager wants me to tell you

653
00:39:26,586 --> 00:39:29,872
that the weather is cold, but you, my lady, are hot-headed

654
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,038
But Imperial Concubine Wan is like my sister

655
00:39:33,743 --> 00:39:35,424
The Empress Dowager said

656
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:38,143
hot-headed people inevitably make mistakes.

657
00:39:38,947 --> 00:39:40,984
Before you came here, you must have

658
00:39:41,029 --> 00:39:43,595
already visited Yangxin Palace and Jingren Palace

659
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:47,048
If His Majesty and the Empress have ignored you

660
00:39:47,114 --> 00:39:49,904
there's no point for the Empress Dowager to see you either.

661
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:52,193
Please return, Noble Lady Hui.

662
00:39:55,389 --> 00:39:57,115
Aunty...
