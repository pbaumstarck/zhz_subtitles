00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,800
Episode 44

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,400
Meal delivery

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,000
Vegetarian meal again!? You guys...

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,300
Quit complaining

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,600
To eat or not, you choose

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,400
Not eating? I'm going to feed it to the dogs then.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,700
Don't Don't Don't

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,700
Having something to eat is better than nothing

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,200
Come back an hour later to collect the utensils

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,900
Let's go

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,300
This bunch of lowly eunuch, only know how to take advantage of others.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,900
They must have taken a portion of our share

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,100
to get favour from their master

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,200
lower your voices

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,200
without the higher up's backing

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,500
they wouldn't be so daring

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,900
liu zhu

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,700
take these two to heat it up

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,100
and our charcoal are almost used up

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,600
Imperial Household hasn't send us any supplies for a very long time.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,700
looks like the wind is picking up

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,700
our master is still hungry

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
lets heat it up and fill our tummy first

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,500
lets go

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
your highness, this few dishes still can be eaten

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,000
your servant, has just asked of liu zhen to heat it up

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,000
eat it while its still hot

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,800
i'm not hungry

29
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,200
share it among yourselves

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,700
your highness, if you continue to starve yourself

31
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,100
you will eventually collapse

32
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,700
then the servants of this household

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,000
will have nobody to rely on

34
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,400
save me half a bun

35
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
the rest split among yourselves

36
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,300
I will do as you say

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,800
your highness

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,100
you become weaker and weaker by the day

39
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,500
where exactly are you not feeling well?

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,600
I feel so languish

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,100
I cant even exert any strength

42
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
and my waist feels so very sore

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,700
what should we do

44
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,300
your servant has to think of ways to get the imperial physician over

45
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,300
forget it, they will never come over

46
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,800
the day before, Xiao yu zi had a high fever. he wanted to go over to get some medicine

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,100
but they refused to spare any

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,100
thank god, Xiao yu zi had always has a strong constitution.

49
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,200
otherwise he wouldn't had made it

50
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,100
your highness has always been weak

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,500
Xiao yu zi can make it through, but your body constitution is different from his

52
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,700
your servant has got to think of a solution

53
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,400
to get the imperial physician here for sure

54
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,300
hun bi, take good care of our master

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,900

63
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,800
his majesty only grounded her highness

64
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,600
he didn't ban her from seeking medical attention didn't he?

65
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,800
what if her highness had any mishap

66
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:32,302

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,900
his majesty had given the edict before

71

no one in this household is allowed leave this mansion

72
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
anything other than that, we couldn't be bothered anyway

73
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,900

160
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,900

this is my chance to turn things around

162
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,500
if that is so

163
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,300
what you have said previously

164
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,100
why isn't there any orders to revoke the grounded edict

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,800
your majesty also didn't said any words of comfort

166
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,900
this so call babysitting

167
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,300
is also because of the child in my stomach

168
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,300
its not because of me

169
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,600

you and I have known each other for so long

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,700
when have you ever seen me doing injustice to myself

180
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,100

181
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,300

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,600
its also for lady hui

187
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,800
gratitude towards your highness

188
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,700
the days that I have been grounded

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,800
sister you must had been worried

190
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,300

191
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,900
all together was refuse entry

192
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,700
her lady was so anxious

193
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,500
tell my lady hui to rest assure. i'm fine

194
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,300
your servant understands

195
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,000
your highness rest well for the baby

196
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
your servant shall take his leave

197
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,500
jin xin

198
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,100
this time with a child is also not too bad

199
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,800
his majesty wouldn't be so heartless then

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,100
its also a blessing that its wen physician looking after you

201
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,200
your servant is rest assured

202
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,500
you also feel that his majesty is too heartless?

203
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,400
so many children in this palace are not able to be deliver safely

204
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,200
her majesty is very wary

205
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,900
your highness has to be careful from now onwards

206
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,400
jin xin get me the brush and ink

207
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,600
your highness is still weak

208
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,100
if theres anything, wait till you get better

209
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,900
go get it

210
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,700
i got it

211
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,700
now that i'm pregnant

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,300
his majesty will be oblige to read my letters

213
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,100
you must think of ways to send it to him

214
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
what has your highness wrote?

215
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,900
i beg his majesty

216
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,100
to get her majesty to personally overlook my pregnancy

217
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,800
her majesty, the empress!?

218
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,500
your highness has always been wary of her

219
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,700
you been grounded, isn't that the doing of the empress

220
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,700
why would you want the empress to overlook personally

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,700
only because in the palace the empress is high above all

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,500
if i want to keep this child

223
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,300
with only myself its will not be enough

224
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,500
her majesty set up this trap to do me in

225
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,800
she must have hated me to the core

226
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,500
naturally she will hate the child in me

227
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,100
i want her to take care of everything

228
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,800
if there is any mishap

229
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,600
she will have to take reponsibility

230
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,000
she will nonetheless do her very best

231
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,400
to keep this child

232
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,400
for every thing to be smooth

233
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,800
this is the best plan

234
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,000
if your highness wants to regain his majesty favour

235
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,200
all of this will have to be pin on this unborn child

236
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,500
i just hope this child can grow up well safely

237
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,400
take it

238
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,500
im afraid the bird nest has already turn cold

239
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,300
let me go get you some milk instead

240
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
do that later

241
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,200
my taste bud feels bland

242
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,400
let liu zhu give instructions to the kitchen

243
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,500
to make a bowl of shrimp congee

244
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,400
separated this period of time, do you feel more at ease?

245
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,100
i cant seem to settled down

246
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,800
the news from wan concubine keeps bothering me everyday

247
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,400
but i cant go closer to get a better look

248
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,400
you have to know the son of heaven is angry

249
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,800
so I advise you

250
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,200
don't rub it on, in the teeth of the storm

251
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,800
even if its the peak of the storm

252
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,700
wan concubine days would be like hell

253
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,400
this times wan concubine should be living in hell

254
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,500
she should struggle

255
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,200
if these times, the emperor

256
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,700
still protect and shield her

257
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,900
I would be so worried

258
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,300
but wan concubine only worn a wrong clothing item

259
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,900
his majesty does not have to go to that extreme

260
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,300
althrough i won't ask more than i should

261
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,200
but there must be other reasons

262
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,400
I beg of your majesty, empress dowager to sae wan concubine!

263
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,700
now is not the time yet

264
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,700
i cant promise you

265
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,600
your majesty

266
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,800
you don't understand

267
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,400
the emperor has to get his angry off his chest

268
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,100
only then

269
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,500
wan concubine will have a chance to find favor

270
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,500
otherwise even if she is release

271
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,800
do you think she will have good days ahead?

272
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,200
more ever this issue involves the empress

273
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,300
if the emperor don't want to budge, nobody can do anything about it

274
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,300
your highness

275
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,200
your highness is now a pregnant mother

276
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,800
one person eat, two person nourish

277
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,700
drink more

278
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,900
where's liu zhu

279
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,400
when you guys came in to gave your congrats

280
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
did you see her?

281
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,200
your highness looks that your servant doesn't serve you good enough?

282
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,800
why do you keep thinking of liu zhu?

283
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,400
where's liu zhu?

284
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,700
nothing's wrong

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,500
its just that these few days she didn't rest well

286
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,200
caught a cold and is resting

287
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
i shall go take a look

288
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,900
your highness

289
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,800
she just fell asleep

290
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,900
you have just woke up

291
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,700
why not go visit her later

292
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,800
don't try to stop me. i'm going to take a look

293
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,200
your highness!

294
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,900
don't bother

295
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,800
liu zhu...

296
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,300
shes no longer around

297
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,100
what did you say?

298
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,900
how did you think wen physician came in?

299
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,300
the people outside didn't listen to our plea

300
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,500
liu zhu sacrifice herself by the blade

301
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,600
the other outside were afraid of the higher up blaming them hence

302
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,500
wen physician was able to come over

303
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,200
fortunately its wen physician that came over

304
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,700
but liu zhu

305
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,600
she's no longer alive

306
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
you...

307
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,200
i already said earlier not to let your highness know about it

308
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,700
afraid that it might harm the fetus

309
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,300
your highness, your servant knows your upset

310
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,300
but no matter how sad your highness must understand

311
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,100
the most important issue at hand is to preserve yourself

312
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,500
liu zhu died for your highness

313
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,400
your highness must not let her death be in vain

314
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,700
only with your highness well

315
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,000
then can you exact revenge for liu zhu

316
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,900
liu zhu and I have grown up together since young

317
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,300
shes like my blood sister

318
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,900
your highness!

319
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,700
no don't!

320
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,300
your hand has only just been bandage

321
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,600
what to do if you made the wound worse

322
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,500
has your highness forget that day how lady chun died

323
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,500
at that time you can endure

324
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,700
why not now!?

325
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
if your highness injure yourself

326
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,300
in future

327
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,500
how would you exact revenge for liu zhu

328
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,600
you are right

329
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,900
i can only continue living on

330
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,700
liu zhu's sacrifice then would not be in vain

331
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,600
greeting royal mother

332
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,600
get up

333
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,000
yes

334
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,900
whether im at ease or not, things are still how it is

335
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,900
whether the children of the emperor is good and well is what that has me worrying

336
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,900
are you referring to wan concubine's unborn child?

337
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,100
from what i heard from the emperor

338
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,600
wan concubine would like you to protect this child

339
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,400
i am not that capable

340
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,000
even my elder prince i couldn't protect

341
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,100
you have the capability, this i believe

342
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,200
since you have put it this way

343
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,200
i shall not refuse

344
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,100
looking after all the concubines and ladies is the empress's duty

345
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,600
its good that you know your own duties

346
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,500
being in your position, if you want to protect it

347
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,900
you must overcome the hard with the soft, and be generous

348
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,400
you are the empress of the qing dynasty

349
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,800
also the emperor's empress

350
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,500
your every action affects everybody

351
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,200
even more so to reputation of our family

352
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,500
you are my niece

353
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,100
I hope you will protect the reputation of the empress

354
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,500
protect the honor of the royal family

355
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,600
i got it

356
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,500
protect others which in turn is also protecting yourself

357
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,700
what a surprise that you came to see me on your own initative

358
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:15,949
after recovering, i have been weak ever since

359
00:20:16,072 --> 00:20:18,995
render me unable to serve your majesty, i seek yourmajesty's understanding

360
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:22,831
you came over not to just tell me this i guess

361
00:20:26,112 --> 00:20:28,829
i have a request, please forgive wan concubine

362
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:31,937
I accepted your audience not because i want to hear this from you

363
00:20:31,937 --> 00:20:33,825
since your majesty is willing to see me, you should have known

364
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:35,860
i am going to request this of you

365
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,377
say your piece,the final decision still lies with me

366
00:20:38,377 --> 00:20:40,868
I beg your majesty on behalf of the unborn child

367
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:44,591
right now wan concubine is unsettled, no appetite

368
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:46,974
how can she be able to peacefully nurture the child

369
00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:49,829
I have already instructed steward gou

370
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:53,105
and i have read wan concubines letter

371
00:20:53,105 --> 00:20:55,918
permitted the empress to look after the unborn child

372
00:20:55,949 --> 00:20:58,030
and issue an edict

373
00:20:58,075 --> 00:21:01,902
to reinstate her royal concubine's treatment, but lady wan is still unsettled

374
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:05,036
without your majesty's forgiveness she keeps being paranoid

375
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:07,791
why not let me go over to take care of lady concubine

376
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:10,350
to look after her with due diligence, i have given whatever that is possible

377
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:14,197
its just that i have spoil wan concubine

378
00:21:14,226 --> 00:21:17,660
so much that she doesnt know limit, doing whatever that she wants

379
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:20,429
she deserve to be punish, alright end of disscusion

380
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,190
your majesty, her majesty seeks an audience

381
00:21:27,238 --> 00:21:29,558
summon her, right away

382
00:21:32,054 --> 00:21:34,216
take your leave now

383
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:45,708
greeting to your majesty

384
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:52,066
hundred thousand blessing to your majesty

385
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:54,520
I just met hui concubine on my way in

386
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:56,945
she must have been here for the same issue as me

387
00:21:56,978 --> 00:21:59,866
your majesty, wan concubine is pregnant

388
00:21:59,949 --> 00:22:02,156
at least pay her a visit

389
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,868
forget it

390
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:06,459
might as well dont go

391
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:08,787
once the child is born, we will have to meet eventually

392
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:12,366
wan concubine so far is still under house arrest

393
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:15,264
I wonder wherethe your majesty can revoke your orders

394
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:17,116
there is no need for that

395
00:22:17,148 --> 00:22:21,718
just let her stay in there and nurse her child instead of running around

396
00:22:21,747 --> 00:22:24,945
then I shall send physicians over regularly to check up on her

397
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:28,545
to look after her well being

398
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:31,260
if she wishes to go to the royal garden, she must be accompany.

399
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:33,997
sure. in future

400
00:22:33,997 --> 00:22:35,786
this kind of trival issue, do as you deem fit

401
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:37,666
dont bother asking me

402
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,795
i shall do as you ask

403
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:44,989
hui concubine got wen physician to send over this inner shirt

404
00:22:45,034 --> 00:22:46,868
is so exquisite, little kids wearing is

405
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:49,014
will look so cute

406
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:53,026
it has already been five months

407
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:55,146
his majesty doesnt even drop by

408
00:22:55,985 --> 00:22:57,947
he must have been sick of me

409
00:22:58,505 --> 00:23:01,058
if he doesnt drop by, there is nothing we can do

410
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:04,276
on the other hand, dao concubine and jing concubine

411
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:07,026
always send their regards on behalf of wen physician

412
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:11,383
but an concubine has never ever ask of you

413
00:23:11,383 --> 00:23:13,946
its just so sad

414
00:23:15,147 --> 00:23:17,024
in reality

415
00:23:18,107 --> 00:23:21,436
since when do people stick with you through good and bad times

416
00:23:23,186 --> 00:23:24,980
people are like that

417
00:23:25,025 --> 00:23:27,466

418
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,830
your highness

419
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,350

426
00:24:17,104 --> 00:24:20,229
since your highness was grounded, your highness has always been worrying about your family outside of this forbidden palace

427
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:23,706
this your highness need not worry

428
00:24:24,378 --> 00:24:27,464
from what I heard, your family has not been implicated

429
00:24:28,786 --> 00:24:31,191
but they are very worried about your highness precadiament

430
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:33,584
your news

431
00:24:33,628 --> 00:24:35,518

433
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,268
everything is well

434
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,201
there is no need for concern

435
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,757
i will do as you say

436
00:24:46,808 --> 00:24:49,054
wen physician has just came over

437
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,230
the child is stable

438
00:24:51,267 --> 00:24:53,226
everything is fine

439
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:56,149
the child is safe

440
00:24:57,353 --> 00:25:00,426
looks like

441
00:25:00,426 --> 00:25:02,547
in a few more month she will give birth

442
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,679
your majesty, shall we?

443
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,909
his majesty has personally instructed me to look after the child

444
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:11,995
how can i disappoint him

445
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:14,877
as long as im involved

446
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,341
nobody shall stir up any problem

447
00:25:17,397 --> 00:25:19,746
what if she loses the child herself?

448
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:22,437
from what i have been hearing

449
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,466
concubine wan has been emotionally unstable

450
00:25:24,946 --> 00:25:27,233
she cannot afford to break down

451
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:30,145
otherwise it would affect the child

452
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:34,188
not only that, once she comes to due,if shes not careful

453
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:36,630
both the child and her will be in danger

454
00:25:42,998 --> 00:25:47,025
I have already stripped him of his rank and sent him home

455
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,830
The officials in the capital,

456
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:52,436
are still going to petition against him?

457
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,995
hence i compile everything

458
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:57,589
and distributed it over the empire

459
00:25:57,638 --> 00:25:59,869
has it been seen to?

460
00:25:59,897 --> 00:26:01,909
your majesty

461
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:04,266
your servant has went over the details

462
00:26:17,906 --> 00:26:20,380
coming to this kind of issues

463
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,272
only then will will you find out whether the subordinates below are loyal or not

464
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,984
I

465
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:30,844
since my ascension, I have been worried about fractions

466
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:32,985
but that has yet to be resolve

467
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:37,357
this is a good time to see whether the officias has any other ulterior motive

468
00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:39,830
Since

469
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:43,626
Chen Ban Yan is corrupt

470
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,075
then

471
00:26:46,103 --> 00:26:48,226
strip Chen Ban Yan of his title and rank

472
00:26:48,277 --> 00:26:51,270
wu xiao ge is to be exiled

473
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:53,637
I shall do as you instruct

474
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:57,946
But there is something that I have to report

475
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:00,546
King: Speak <br> Servant: It involves zhen officer

476
00:27:16,982 --> 00:27:18,469
Speak

477
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:46,626
Give him three days

478
00:27:46,656 --> 00:27:49,390
If he is willing

479
00:27:52,028 --> 00:27:56,020
otherwise I will also deal with him

480
00:27:56,704 --> 00:27:58,019
but

481
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:01,405
zhen yuan dao is wan concubine, paternal father

482
00:28:01,424 --> 00:28:03,304
I'm afraid

483
00:28:03,343 --> 00:28:06,380
this will alarm concubine Wan and her unborn child

484
00:28:06,441 --> 00:28:08,263
that would not be good

485
00:28:08,263 --> 00:28:10,141
I have my own ways

486
00:28:10,181 --> 00:28:13,790
You go and persoanlly speak Qian Ming Shi

487
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:16,420
Zhen Yuan Dao

488
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:18,612
Why is he involved

489
00:28:19,522 --> 00:28:20,981
Yes

490
00:28:25,493 --> 00:28:27,409
sorry to trouble you, please announce our arrival

491
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:29,589
what a coincidence, our master has just fallen asleep

492
00:28:29,623 --> 00:28:31,410
Now that her highness is pregnant,

493
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,590
of course she has to rest well, we shall wait

494
00:28:34,623 --> 00:28:37,028
Oh, right, Miss

495
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:39,580
has her highness's cramp condition any better?

496
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,430
there hasnt been any improvement

497
00:28:41,463 --> 00:28:43,578
she has problem sleeping at nights

498
00:28:43,578 --> 00:28:46,221
Then she should drink more bone broth

499
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:48,346
with a dash of vinegar

500
00:28:48,368 --> 00:28:50,268
give her more tofu and fruits in her daily diet

501
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:52,419
only then can it help to alleviate her cramps symtoms

502
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:55,097
er drink some milk before sleeping

503
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:57,124
this will help counter insomnia

504
00:28:57,139 --> 00:28:59,743
I understand, from now onwards i will make bone broth daily for my master

505
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,903
Is wan physician outside?

506
00:29:01,938 --> 00:29:03,738

507
00:29:03,788 --> 00:29:05,899

508
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:15,029
Please heed my advise, Since your highness has insomnia

509
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:17,578
Its mainly because of worrying too much

510
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,104
This is not something that medicine can helpl relieve

511
00:29:20,143 --> 00:29:22,467
Since you are well aware of this

512
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,618
Why mention it anyway

513
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:27,818
LAter when you report to the empress

514
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:30,419

I understand, His majesty has request of her to take care of you

517
00:29:38,668 --> 00:29:41,109
You would not dare to do anything to your highness and the unborn child

518
00:29:41,143 --> 00:29:44,496
She often summon your humble servant for questioning

519
00:29:44,496 --> 00:29:46,628
Im relieve that you know how to deal with her

520
00:29:46,628 --> 00:29:48,913
I understand

521
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:52,530
Please come with me to get the medicine

522
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:55,252
Then bring it back to prepare the medicine

523
00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:57,930
Remember to personally give it to her highness

524
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,262
do not allow anyone else to interfere

525
00:30:00,308 --> 00:30:03,063
I understand. Wen physician is indeed understanding

526
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:05,981
Is my sister's hui concubines hand recovering?

527
00:30:06,022 --> 00:30:08,268
It has been much better now

528
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:10,823
Even through her wound is slow to recover

529
00:30:10,868 --> 00:30:13,226
But it will be completely healed before autumn

530
00:30:13,226 --> 00:30:16,628
Just that there will be a minor scar

531
00:30:16,657 --> 00:30:18,499
Scar?..

532
00:30:18,547 --> 00:30:21,064
My sister didnt use scar relieve gel?

533
00:30:23,976 --> 00:30:26,580
I still have duties to attend to.

534
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,590
I shall take my leave.

535
00:30:36,488 --> 00:30:38,100
your highness

536
00:30:38,147 --> 00:30:40,699
If an concubine has anything to pass to you

537
00:30:40,747 --> 00:30:43,309
Please let me screen it through before consuming

538
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:45,500
Sir wait a second

539
00:30:49,475 --> 00:30:52,218
If you want me to nurse my child in peace

540
00:30:52,943 --> 00:30:55,091
Please be frank with me

541
00:30:55,139 --> 00:30:57,381
You are making me uneasy on purpose

542
00:30:59,115 --> 00:31:01,860
what is it? please dont hesitate to tell me

543
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:05,105
Inside that scar relieve gel...

544
00:31:08,315 --> 00:31:10,112
There is something else

545
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:11,990
inside the scar relieve gel

546
00:31:14,954 --> 00:31:16,740
musk?

547
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,273
there is musk inside the gel. isnt it?

548
00:31:21,303 --> 00:31:23,023
Yes...

549
00:31:23,084 --> 00:31:24,849
Yes

550
00:31:24,938 --> 00:31:27,539
There is an unknown amount of musk inside the gel

551
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:30,175
entry into the body through the wound

552
00:31:30,175 --> 00:31:32,470
will be the eqivalent daily dosage

553
00:31:33,062 --> 00:31:36,944
the gel is to cover up the musk's scent

554
00:31:36,976 --> 00:31:39,674
Unless it s a specialist

555
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,411
that person wouldnt not be able to concoct it otherwise

556
00:31:43,982 --> 00:31:47,370
actually, it might not be concubine an's doing

557
00:31:47,444 --> 00:31:50,021
after all the pain relieve gel in your palace

558
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:52,539
is accessible to anyone

559
00:31:54,196 --> 00:31:56,223
your highness

560
00:31:56,278 --> 00:31:58,467
are you naseous

561
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,462
human true nature makes me feel even more disgusting

562
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,311
does sister mei knows about this?

563
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:07,909
I do not dare rave about this

564
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:10,583
she must be kept in the dark

565
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,468
if this is indeed concubine an's doing

566
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:17,276
she must have held a grudge

567
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:20,822
now that I have lost favor

568
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:22,838
my sister must have been in even worse shape

569
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:26,751
dont forget to tell mei sister

570
00:32:27,632 --> 00:32:30,309
do not by all means offend the empress and an ling rong

571
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,709
do you get it?

572
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,461
you may go

573
00:32:52,418 --> 00:32:55,112
your highness should be happy instead

574
00:33:00,148 --> 00:33:02,016
an's concubine dedication

575
00:33:02,102 --> 00:33:04,792
if she is a spy before

576
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:06,793
then now she is a famous spy

577
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:09,030
isnt this even better for us to be prepare against?

578
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:11,154
you are in the light

579
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,607
of course the lesser enemy you have

580
00:33:13,631 --> 00:33:16,120
the better it is

581
00:33:16,165 --> 00:33:18,480
are you

582
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,072
hurt about the relationship with your sisters?

583
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,191
looks like she and me

584
00:33:25,227 --> 00:33:28,344
can still be consider sisters'

585
00:33:28,344 --> 00:33:32,471
your affinities and concubine hui is a rare thing to come by

586
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:35,514
but you cannot expect everybody to recipocate

587
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:37,704
I dont understand

588
00:33:38,197 --> 00:33:41,063
Is this how she repay me

589
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:43,109
even if one day the truth is reveal

590
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:45,444
it will be an ugly truth

591
00:33:46,743 --> 00:33:49,024
You may be true and good to an concubine

592
00:33:49,053 --> 00:33:51,665
but not everybody will reciporcate

593
00:33:55,151 --> 00:33:57,184
I know that the current me

594
00:33:57,184 --> 00:34:00,554
does not have any means to retaliate

595
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:03,629
what you said is true

596
00:34:03,661 --> 00:34:06,266
good and bad

597
00:34:06,322 --> 00:34:08,513
its all for personal gains

598
00:34:10,596 --> 00:34:12,520
I was once panariod

599
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,870
liu ru might be acting under another's instruction

600
00:34:16,195 --> 00:34:18,389
but whether she's willing or not

601
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:20,873
it is still her doing

602
00:34:24,547 --> 00:34:26,033
yi xin, im here

603
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,384
you made me realise in time

604
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:34,110
your highness values this relationship hence your upset

605
00:34:34,817 --> 00:34:36,880
but you must remember

606
00:34:36,906 --> 00:34:40,040
in this harem, even if its blood sister

607
00:34:40,585 --> 00:34:42,918
you would still turn against each other

608
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:44,670
You're right

609
00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:47,335
Master and subject relationship is indeed so

610
00:34:48,706 --> 00:34:51,038
this so call sister

611
00:34:58,589 --> 00:34:59,949
Last night

612
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:02,114
you didnt get to sleep well

613
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:04,320
why not go back to sleep

614
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,034
you may leave

615
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,127
get su bi to serve me, I understand

616
00:35:11,663 --> 00:35:12,834
Yes, your Majesty

617
00:35:16,707 --> 00:35:18,390
I shall take my leave

618
00:35:27,965 --> 00:35:29,922
how is it over at her side?

619
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,192
Your majesty

620
00:35:31,232 --> 00:35:33,926
You seal the palace to forbid entry and exit

621
00:35:34,394 --> 00:35:36,552
you are getting over your head

622
00:35:37,913 --> 00:35:39,590
forgive your humble servant insolence

623
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,424
I'm afriad once you know you will be worried

624
00:35:43,429 --> 00:35:45,509
is she not feeling well anywhere?

625
00:35:45,538 --> 00:35:47,990
I thought she has already past her third month phrase

626
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,601
what your majesty knows

627
00:35:50,629 --> 00:35:53,069
her previous pregnancy, she had a miscarriage

628
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:56,574
now that she is under house arrest, she must be feeling pent up

629
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:00,200
from what yin xi said, her highness couldnt sleep well

630
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:03,334
Think about it, if her highness cant sleep well, then the royal child

631
00:36:03,354 --> 00:36:05,201
also cant sleep well

632
00:36:06,343 --> 00:36:08,558
what you said is the truth

633
00:36:10,764 --> 00:36:12,908
its too hot i cant sleep either

634
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:15,070
accompany me to take a walk outside

635
00:36:15,075 --> 00:36:17,267
let me summon a sedan

636
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,275
what if your majesty collapse from the heat, then your humble servant deserve a hundred thousand death

637
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:22,750
no need for a hundred thousand death, you being like this

638
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:25,119
dying once is enough

639
00:36:26,116 --> 00:36:29,071
I have somewhere that i want to go

640
00:36:29,117 --> 00:36:31,944
then I shall get an umbrella

641
00:36:38,993 --> 00:36:40,952
hundred thousand blessing to your majesty

642
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:46,312
does she often sleep in this uneasy state?

643
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,752
these few days her highness felt the movement of her child

644
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:55,790
hence unable to sleep well

645
00:36:55,831 --> 00:36:57,551
thus she appear to be worn out

646
00:36:57,585 --> 00:37:00,631
how is her appetite? does she finish the food that is send here?

647
00:37:02,314 --> 00:37:04,269
she is upset

648
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:06,519
her appetite is decreasing

649
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,406
everything taste bland

650
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,520
that is her fault then

651
00:37:10,554 --> 00:37:12,985
for the sake of the child, she should at least eat some

652
00:37:12,985 --> 00:37:15,595
its not that her highness doesnt want to eat, i know

653
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,835
its starting to get late, your majesty

654
00:37:18,878 --> 00:37:21,020
it wouldnt be nice if other hears of this

655
00:37:25,484 --> 00:37:27,514
serve your master faithfully

656
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:29,721
you will stand to gain

657
00:37:29,755 --> 00:37:31,080
i understand

658
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,633
I seek your forgiveness your highness. i did not mean to intrude

659
00:37:53,725 --> 00:37:55,871
its just that his majesty had instruction

660
00:37:55,909 --> 00:37:57,834
to accompany your higness wherever you go

661
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,831
to take care of your well being

662
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:01,753
being look after

663
00:38:01,788 --> 00:38:03,629
under survelliance

664
00:38:03,636 --> 00:38:06,000
to me

665
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:08,075
his majesty edict means the same thing

666
00:38:08,132 --> 00:38:11,112
if your highness is tired, you should take a rest at the pavillion

667
00:38:11,153 --> 00:38:13,083
to catch your breath

668
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:15,269
as you progress further into pregency, it cant be help to feel tired easily

669
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:40,487
this incident

670
00:38:40,513 --> 00:38:43,670
if only back then your servant had groom your highness better

671
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:45,920
to prevent such injustice upon entering the palace

672
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:47,701
to suffer this injustice

673
00:38:48,198 --> 00:38:50,153
both me and you sister, are not saints

674
00:38:51,714 --> 00:38:53,591
how would we know what is going to happen in future

675
00:38:54,391 --> 00:38:56,904
actually his majesty is still concern about your highness

676
00:38:57,807 --> 00:38:59,141
is that so?

677
00:39:00,814 --> 00:39:02,732
is he worried about me

678
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,353
or my unborn child?

679
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:08,009
His Majesty,

680
00:39:19,913 --> 00:39:22,071
greetings to your highness

681
00:39:22,124 --> 00:39:24,074
its just a royal concubine that has lost favor

682
00:39:24,121 --> 00:39:25,997
whats more she is a sinner

683
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:28,006
why bother to show your respect towards her

684
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:40,000
her highness is still an upright person

685
00:39:41,121 --> 00:39:44,399
women in the palace are like flowers in the garden

686
00:39:44,437 --> 00:39:46,909
once it withers

687
00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:49,751
it will blossom again

688
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,078
this batch withers

689
00:39:53,122 --> 00:39:55,600
and in comes another new batch

690
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:59,832
just like endless spring blossom
