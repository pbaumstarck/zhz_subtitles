1
00:00:00,204 --> 00:00:03,377
Episode 45

2
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:37,582
Apricot

3
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,200
Although the flower is beautiful, the fruit it produces is extremely sour.

4
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,900
Almond is even more bitter.

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,000
What is the point in working for others,

6
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:54,222
If you have a good start but ended with failure?

7
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:01,507
It would have been better to be the evergreen pine

8
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:05,708
It doesn't matter whether it flowers or bear fruits

9
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,700
young miss we should get going then, the kitchen has prepared the south north stewed partridge

10
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,300
It will be most nutritious if you eat now

11
00:01:17,872 --> 00:01:20,747
Let's go , I am feeling hungry too

12
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,300
Reporting to emperor

13
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,500
I believe the investigation into Qian Ming Shi case is sufficient by now

14
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,900
it would be better not to go too far into it

15
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,400
If the epistolary incident spreads to everyone's ears

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,500
officials will be mired in panic.

17
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,987
Who would then dare speak their minds?

18
00:01:57,346 --> 00:02:00,446
If pandering proliferates

19
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,630
then justice and rectitude will be stymied.

20
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Are you implying that I obstruct freedom of speech?

21
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,100
No, I would not dare.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,400
I am only an official

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,300
if I cannot uphold my given duties

24
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:25,027
I would be letting you down.

25
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,500
Your majesty,

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,200
Zhen Yuandao is being obdurate and blasphemous

27
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,500
he should be severely punished.

28
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,300
Your Majesty,

29
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:49,347
Zhen Yuandao's treasonous intentions are apparent

30
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:52,575
but on account of Imperial Concubine Wan's pregnancy,

31
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:55,351
your majesty should

32
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,800
postpone Zhen Yuandao's penalty.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,100
As Imperial Concubine Wan's father, Zhen Yuandao

34
00:03:03,506 --> 00:03:05,388
should not be protected by her daughter's saintly halo

35
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:09,707
He has offended you with his choleric temper and unfettered arrogance

36
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:13,787
If you come down on him mercifully for Imperial Concubine Wan's sake,

37
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,307
what about the discipline of the courts?

38
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:22,467
All cases of treason should be punished equally

39
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:36,387
Zhen Yuandao shall be stripped of his post and incarcerated.

40
00:03:38,187 --> 00:03:40,795
And his family shall be confined to their dwelling

41
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:50,071
Thank you, your majesty.

42
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,626
Jinxi, today is the Double Ninth Festival (festival for the elderly)

43
00:03:57,589 --> 00:04:00,745
we have to pay our respects to the Empress Dowager

44
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,700
Have you prepared the chrysanthemum cakes and wine?

45
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:08,515
Yes, I even decorated the box

46
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:11,957
with three colours

47
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,200
Fang Ruo came to pick it up this morning.

48
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,400
That sounds perfect.

49
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,639
Greetings, Imperial Concubine Wan. What are you doing here, Aunty?

50
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:31,992
The Empress Dowager was thrilled to receive your gift

51
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:36,085
and is concerned about your pregnancy, so she sent me over.

52
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,100
I'm ever so grateful.

53
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,600
It must be a hard time for you,

54
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,800
let us know if you have any difficulties.

55
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:49,387
Everything's fine,

56
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:54,827
but today is the Double Ninth Festival

57
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:58,645
I miss my family.

58
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:03,289
According to the harem regulations, you may invite

59
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,400
your family over when you are 8 months pregnant.

60
00:05:06,832 --> 00:05:09,155
That should be any time soon.

61
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:13,700
I will remind the Internal Affairs Department to invite your family in.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,200
Although I am found guilty towards His Majesty, it seems my family doesn't being involved of it. I am relieved now.

63
00:05:21,512 --> 00:05:25,421
I still have errands to run for Empress Dowager. <br>It's not convenient for me to stay too long.

64
00:05:25,429 --> 00:05:27,347
I shall take my leave first.

65
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,080
Thank you, Gugu. <br>It's just that I won't be able to send you off.

66
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
Take care, Niangniang.

67
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:45,922
Imperial Concubine Wan didn't suspect anything, did she?

68
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:48,848
It's a grace from Empress Dowager, <br>I don't think she would suspect anything.

69
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,161
Thank goodness it had finally passed.

70
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,000
How could it be so unlucky? Early this morning

71
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:59,222
I came to give the Emperor

72
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,200
I never thought that helping the Empress deliever this errand

73
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,387
Early in the morning i knew something was wrong, and i'm so distraught

74
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:09,503
How would I dare to meet Niangniang?

75
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:12,270
So I had no choice but to trouble you, Gugu.

76
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:15,457
You may hide it from her for the time being. <br>But you can't hide it forever!

77
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:18,938
Niangniang is in the advanced stages of her pregnancy.<br>She mustn't find out about this...

78
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:21,584
Otherwise, what's going to happen if it affects the fetus?

79
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:27,753
Yes. Those are my thoughts too.<br>It's a good thing that the penalty for the Zhen Residence isnt' settled yet.

80
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,900
Perhaps, for Niangniang's sake, His Majesty...

81
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
will be willing to show some mercy.

82
00:06:34,006 --> 00:06:35,587
That's not something we should concern ourselves with.

83
00:06:36,224 --> 00:06:38,501
Let's return.

84
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:43,222
It's always been Fangruo who comes. <br>Why was it Sun Gugu today?

85
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,300
Perhaps it's because the present young miss sent over was favoured by The Empress,thus sent Sun Gugu here as dignity.

86
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:53,609
Don't you feel that Sun Gugu's mannerisms were a little weird?

87
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,800
Young mistress please don't think so much.It's time for you to have medicine. I'll go take the medicine over.

88
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:10,952
This soup has been stewed for 6 hours.

89
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,989
It melts instantly once enters the mouth. Do you like it, Mother?

90
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:18,592
It's very good. Tastes sweet and soft.

91
00:07:18,953 --> 00:07:20,553
It's good as long as you like it, Mother.

92
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:24,964
People say,eat desserts will make one feel happy.

93
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,792
However after I ate this dessert,

94
00:07:29,123 --> 00:07:31,472
it still seems tasteless to me.

95
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:37,758
I heard there was official pleading for ZhengYuan Dao

96
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:41,748
He made the emperor very angry, had be put into the prison

97
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:43,711
It is like that

98
00:07:43,787 --> 00:07:48,711
The polity is so turbulent that the harem is not calm

99
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,272
I am incompetent

100
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,472
It's not that you're incompetent, it's that you're

101
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:59,592
much more bright and competent than Chun Yuan

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,600
I don't want to invade your affairs that how to be a wife and how to be a queen in these years

103
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:12,234
but only one rule that the Imperial Heirs are the most important

104
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:17,599
Women in the palace are like the endlessly blooming flowers.

105
00:08:18,592 --> 00:08:21,913
Even if you remove one, <br>another will replace her.

106
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:32,100
The queen should be in charge of blossom rather than always mows them what cause the tragedy, and especially

107
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:36,553
No matter what, you must not hurt the Imperial Heirs.

108
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:44,207
After my first son was gone, I've been hoping that there will be someone to pass down the Emperor's throne

109
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:47,193
Even though there are three princes at the moment...

110
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,900
Three?

111
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:50,872
How many sons did the previous Emperor have?

112
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:53,478
It's nothing compared to the previous Emperor

113
00:08:54,988 --> 00:08:58,084
It's your responsibility for Emperor's lack of sons...

114
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,600
Go reflect under the Door of Zhong Si

115
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,031
Think about my concerns.

116
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,100
Yes.

117
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,700
Peace upon you, Empress.

118
00:09:31,592 --> 00:09:36,391
Niangniang, the winds are strong. <br>Why don't you return to your palace first?

119
00:09:37,714 --> 00:09:41,832
An, do you know the mean of the door of Zhongsi

120
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:45,761
I don't. Please enlighten me, Niangniang.

121
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:53,445
Zhongsi. Should your descendants names act as Zhongsi (crickets).

122
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:55,989
The meaning is expect lots of children from the Emperor

123
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:58,484
The Emperor throne shall be for ever extended

124
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,800
I really hope to have a prince of my own.

125
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:07,520
My prince could already laugh and speak, yet a wind illness

126
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:10,491
made him die in my arms

127
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,700
Now, seeing others becoming pregnant one after another within the palace

128
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:20,161
these children were born one by one

129
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:26,840
how could I afford this emotionally

130
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:32,101
Niangniang, children that you do not like...

131
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,760
should not exist in this world.

132
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,759
Not for any other reason, other than the fact that you are the Mother of this nation.

133
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:42,959
Similarly, women that you do not like...

134
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:46,161
should not continue to exist and cause you annoyance.

135
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,804
That's why I like you.

136
00:11:00,498 --> 00:11:01,201
Niangniang.

137
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,700
Wuan ping has only 8 more months before she gives birth.

138
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,300
The birth of a baby is a blessed event

139
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,840
I've fulfilled my responsibility

140
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,482
Poor Wuan Ping, she's already so far into her pregnancy.

141
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:19,950
If she were to find out that something happened to her family,

142
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,119
who knows how she will be hurt?

143
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,311
You'd better get the Medical Department to take good care of her.

144
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:31,681
No matter what, you mustn't let the cat out of the bag.

145
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,639
I will remember that.

146
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:38,204
Niangniang, let me accompany you back first.

147
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,999
That's not necessary.

148
00:11:40,348 --> 00:11:43,521
His Majesty should have just awoken from his afternoon nap.

149
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:47,053
You should return to attend to him.

150
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,404
Thank you for your understanding, Niangniang.

151
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,165
Go.

152
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,800
I've been pregnant for 8 months now.

153
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:10,120
Why hasn't the Internal Affairs Department arranged for Mother to enter the palace yet?

154
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:14,721
In the morning, when Aunt Fang wu came she was also stuttering

155
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:19,959
Last time when Su Pei came to pass on a message, she said the weather is chilly today

156
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:24,241
and to not go out for a stroll. They were thinking for your health

157
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:30,159
I also resisted my predecessors. Please ask your mother to come to the Palace. This is internal affairs' matter

158
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:38,682
These few days, I've been feeling very uneasy.

159
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,500
You're baby is almost due. It would make sense for them to be more cautious.

160
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:52,722
Thats true, the baby is almost here.

161
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,867
By that time, it will be cold

162
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,826
I want to sew a couple blankets for him.

163
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay, I'll help you too. You don't need to do any of the needlework.

164
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:03,829
Let me do it.

165
00:13:04,468 --> 00:13:06,453
I will pull the cotton then.

166
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,700
I give you, Wuan Ping niang niang my greetings.

167
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:18,322
Your childs birth is approaching. The Imperial household ordered the delivery of these ‘easy birth stones'

168
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,200
I bless you a successful delivery and wellness for you both.

169
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:25,189
What's your name? Why have I never seen you before?

170
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:29,789
Im new, originally Huang da ge was supposed to come.

171
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:33,108
He suddenly had a stomach ache, so i came instead.

172
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,200
This money is an award from our lady, treat yourself to some tea.

173
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:41,548
Thank you Niang Niang.

174
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,500
This is not much.

175
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:45,627
The day my family arrives at the palace,

176
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:47,667
I will greatly award you.

177
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,700
Thank you niang niang.

178
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,400
But I have not heard lately, that anyone was entering the palace.

179
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,906
May I ask, what kind of job they do? (social status)

180
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,670
My family is not a very renowned one.

181
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:19,368
At such an old age, sent to jail

182
00:14:23,202 --> 00:14:24,584
How did this happen?

183
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:32,794
Niangniang, there's a lot you're unaware of. <br>Even with that contribution, they commited a grave crime.

184
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
For example, that Nian family.

185
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:40,027
He was reported by someone.

186
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,500
Who reported it?<br>Out with it quickly!

187
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,482
-It was Lord E'min.<br>-Lies!

188
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,700
Hasn't Lord E'min always been on good terms with Lord Zhen? Why would he report Lord Zhen?

189
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,800
How would I understand what's going on in Court?

190
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,430
But everyone knows about this!<br>I wouldn't dare to lie about it!

191
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,031
I have other errands to run.

192
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:08,112
I'll take my leave first.

193
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:13,387
Young Mistress, what should we do?

194
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Alright.

195
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:17,986
Alright.

196
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,640
Young Mistress!<br>Her fetus has been affected! Call Physician Wen!

197
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,300
Greetings, Young Mistress.

198
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,800
Have you completed the task I assigned to you?

199
00:15:33,627 --> 00:15:37,429
Exactly as per your instructions, <br>I just heard them summon for the Physician.

200
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:39,386
Very well.

201
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,200
How fortunate she's going to be now will depend on her own fate.

202
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,700
Carry out another task for me.

203
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,300
At your service.

204
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:53,511
Help me look for something, <br>and deliver it straight to the prison.

205
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,471
Gonggong, it's unclean inside. <br>Come out quickly.

206
00:16:00,722 --> 00:16:02,651
Do I need you to instruct me?

207
00:16:02,676 --> 00:16:04,709
Yes yes yes. Please go ahead, Gonggong.

208
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,500
Someone come quickly! There's a mice! A mice!

209
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:22,588
Lord Wen, there's nothing serious with our Young Mistress, is there?

210
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:24,297
Not anything serious.

211
00:17:24,348 --> 00:17:28,308
But, there are something things that I would like to ask Niangniang.

212
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:30,966
I have something to ask you too.

213
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:34,470
Alright.

214
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:41,607
Niang Niang, you shouldn't stress yourself, it'll hard your fetus.

215
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,150
Yesterday, someone told me what happened to my family.

216
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:49,388
You are able to exit the palace everyday.

217
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:51,670
You must be clear about the situation.

218
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,200
Niangniang, you're aware of everything?<br>Who was so daring to tell you about it?

219
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,200
So you did know about it.

220
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:03,495
Even if I didn't ask...

221
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,539
there would be someone who would think of ways to let me find out.

222
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,200
Firstly, the Emperor ordered it. <br>Secondly, I had to ensure your health.

223
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,400
Now that I know about it...

224
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:22,235
how long were you intending to keep me in the dark?

225
00:18:27,197 --> 00:18:29,756
Madam and Second Miss have been locked up at home.

226
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:32,558
Their predicament is exactly the same as yours.

227
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:34,235
Exactly the same?

228
00:18:35,794 --> 00:18:38,919
I have the amnesty because I'm pregnant

229
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:43,725
My parents have the same treatment ？

230
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,600
He commiserate the usurper？ Why do you say this？

231
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:58,477
niangniang，do you remember the case of Qian Mingshi

232
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:09,944
This is a set-up，isn't it？

233
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,280
So, the Emperor believed it?

234
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:44,359
not just me

235
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:47,401
The Zhens have been framed

236
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:50,043
Young Mistress, something's not right.

237
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:52,840
Xiaoguizi said he arrived shortly Imperial Household

238
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:57,416
He did not know that the family name of Young Mistress is Zhen How could he knew the affaire of our family

239
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,001
You too believe that he's new?

240
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:04,037
As the emperor attach importance to Suiyu Xuan

241
00:20:10,527 --> 00:20:13,521
Someone purposely sent him to tell me the news.

242
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,396
If I had been a little more softhearted,

243
00:20:18,171 --> 00:20:21,805
I'm afraid I would have lost this child.

244
00:20:23,602 --> 00:20:25,282
They're so evil.

245
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:31,053
I would like to beg an audience with His Majesty.

246
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,481
Except, this isnt something that can be easily changed.

247
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,119
His Majesty might not able to come

248
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,000
Can you bring the item and letter in this box to His Majesty?

249
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,000
Dear Huan Huan,my dear wife,

250
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:34,874
Wanwan, if you were around...

251
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:40,719
you would probably understand the dilemmas that I'm experiencing.

252
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:46,963
I know in this world...

253
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,000
only you truly understands me.

254
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,660
No one else but you

255
00:22:00,782 --> 00:22:05,629
Doctor Wen told me to bring this to you from Shattered Jade Palace(the palace that Huan Huan lives in).

256
00:22:23,164 --> 00:22:25,439
My little owner don't hesitate.

257
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:30,864
My family's life and death depends if His Majesty will meet me.

258
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,086
Master. Soo goong goong

259
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:48,161
His Majesty tells you to go to Meditate Heart palace(the palace where His Majesty lives).

260
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:50,681
Wait outside. i would be coming.

261
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:53,600
I would wait outside.

262
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,900
since you are sick, you don't to have to bow

263
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:17,595
After you got pregnant, you start to have a lot of dreams.

264
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:20,488
are you still sleep peacefully?

265
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,400
Now you know i am not seeping well huh?

266
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,723
Fong Goog Goog said

267
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,545
then you believe i am not sleep well

268
00:23:32,523 --> 00:23:35,040
then why don't you ask the royal doctor...

269
00:23:35,077 --> 00:23:40,034
to prescribe me some sleeping medicine

270
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,400
What do you want to say?

271
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:45,320
I want to say that,

272
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,200
you can't just hear one side of the story and judge

273
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:52,440
Then are you sleeping well these days?

274
00:23:55,364 --> 00:24:00,286
Initially, my sleep my indeed fitful.

275
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:02,960
Recently, it's improved.

276
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,000
Fangruo Gugu had no intention of lying to Your Majesty.

277
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,000
You came all this way and you didn't even ask if i am feeling well.

278
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,500
is this all what you want to dicuss with me?

279
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,051
you even know?

280
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:36,695
What happen if i say i don't have the intention to, would you believe it?

281
00:24:36,717 --> 00:24:40,518
having intention to or not, wrong is wrong

282
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,200
can i ask how deep is Queen's punishment?

283
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,000
Can you retrial my father's case so innocent people won't be killed?

284
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:05,037
You said it just now too.

285
00:25:05,078 --> 00:25:07,915
You said that people can't only hear one side of the story.

286
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,838
I wouldn't fully believe E-min's words either.

287
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:18,261
I've taken all that into account.

288
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,113
In all these, I haven't maligned your family at all.

289
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:28,808
I don't know the full story either...

290
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,219
But my father's loyalty to you...

291
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:36,182
have you disregarded that completely, Your Majesty?

292
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:44,244
I've already passed the edict...

293
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:57,437
This is also my consideration for his many years of hard work.

294
00:25:57,843 --> 00:25:59,923
The hardships at Ningguta are second to none.

295
00:26:00,356 --> 00:26:03,520
My parents are so advanced in age...

296
00:26:04,469 --> 00:26:06,666
how would they endure such hardships?

297
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:09,252
Your Majesty!

298
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,600
Do you know what you are saying?

299
00:27:17,118 --> 00:27:19,518
Are you saying that everything I've ever received...

300
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,683
was all because of Empress Chunyuan?

301
00:27:28,002 --> 00:27:30,243
Just because of Wanwan.

302
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,349
Then what am I?

303
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:41,279
Just what am I?

304
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,895
You know it now.

305
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,800
Actually, the fact that you resemble Wanwan to some extent is your fortune too.

306
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:51,677
Really?

307
00:27:53,482 --> 00:27:58,113
Is it really my blessing or my curse?

308
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:05,119
It's not justy Your Majesty who has made a mistake.<br>I made an even bigger mistake!

309
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:10,543
All these years of love and moments...

310
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,554
I've really given them in vain!

311
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,500
Your Majesty.

312
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,100
What is it?

313
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,597
Say it quickly!

314
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:27,475
Someone from the dungeon came to report that...

315
00:28:27,621 --> 00:28:30,308
Lord Zhen has contracted the plague.

316
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:34,037
His life now hangs in the balance.

317
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:40,417
Niangniang!

318
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:44,800
Niangniang, you're pregnant. <br>You have to take care!

319
00:28:47,874 --> 00:28:52,479
Your Majesty, I know you have made your decision,

320
00:28:54,517 --> 00:28:56,520
but my father did nothing wrong.

321
00:28:58,007 --> 00:29:00,557
Please save my father's life.

322
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,479
Don't let my father die wrongfully!

323
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:08,201
I will take responsibility for all the crimes.

324
00:29:10,489 --> 00:29:11,759
I understand.

325
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:18,605
Let's go, Niangniang.

326
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:21,567
Niang Niang

327
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:00,718
What's happened?

328
00:30:01,682 --> 00:30:02,639
Niangniang.

329
00:30:03,404 --> 00:30:04,113
Come.

330
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,600
the giell is ready

331
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:12,001
Niangniang, take care!

332
00:30:13,153 --> 00:30:14,046
Niang Niang

333
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:21,638
Be careful.

334
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:25,798
Hurry up

335
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:37,840
stop master master

336
00:30:40,197 --> 00:30:43,038
master master

337
00:30:48,235 --> 00:30:51,370
huan pin has a lot of blood i think she will give birth

338
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,800
after leaving meditate heart palace( the palace where His Majesty leaves), she shacked the fetus peace.

339
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,398
Ciyiair ciyair please prepare me a ride to shattered jade palace(the palace where haun pin leaves)

340
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,898
Hurry and prepare I need to go to Sui Yu Xuan.

341
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:05,716
No.

342
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:08,108
delivering a baby is big news, i must accompany her. You can't go.

343
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,000
you need to let His Majesty see how huan pin risks her life to to born his child

344
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,700
then the king won't forget about Wuan pin and she will get a chance to receive the Emperor's love.

345
00:31:18,908 --> 00:31:21,600
What use, is this kind of love?!

346
00:31:21,623 --> 00:31:24,140
You can choose to not want it, but she can't.

347
00:31:24,184 --> 00:31:28,352
then if Wuan pin can't keep her life, the child can't survive either.

348
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,706
then i should go invite His Majesty

349
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,600
the king should go by himself or else...

350
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:43,000
right now there is one more important business that needs to be taken care is huan pin's father's life.

351
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:46,910
even if huan pin born the child, huan pin will a still be a guilty men's child.

352
00:31:47,226 --> 00:31:49,705
then how can she ever will be able to raise her head up

353
00:31:52,784 --> 00:31:53,666
okay

354
00:31:53,982 --> 00:31:57,342
Then I'll make the arrangements for <br>Physician Wen to save Lord Wen first.

355
00:31:58,223 --> 00:32:02,785
Niangniang, use more strength!<br>I can see half a head!

356
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,795
More strength, Niangniang!

357
00:32:05,705 --> 00:32:09,946
please use your strength half the head already came out

358
00:32:10,318 --> 00:32:13,948
Niang Niang, push harder.

359
00:32:25,504 --> 00:32:27,705
His Majesty don't worry.

360
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:30,866
Did someone visit her father in jail yet?

361
00:32:34,785 --> 00:32:36,105
That's good then.

362
00:32:39,055 --> 00:32:44,137
He's here. <br> Congratulations Your Majesty, its a princess.

363
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,900
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

364
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:52,072
A princess is good too!

365
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,400
I'll go take a look at Concubine Wan.

366
00:32:54,865 --> 00:32:58,139
Your Majesty, look at yourself!<br>It's not even the first princess!

367
00:32:58,188 --> 00:33:01,543
It's just a princess! <br>How am I that happy?

368
00:33:01,582 --> 00:33:05,142
Your Majesty, you can't even hide your smile!<br>It's all over your face!

369
00:33:07,397 --> 00:33:08,985
Reporting to Empress.

370
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,783
Concubine Wan has given birth to a princess.

371
00:33:13,543 --> 00:33:16,909
A princess?<br>That's good.

372
00:33:17,797 --> 00:33:22,384
I wonder if the Emperor will have a <br>change of heart because of the princess?

373
00:33:25,826 --> 00:33:28,306
Wan Pin wouldn't let it.

374
00:33:30,945 --> 00:33:32,989
She's really pretty.

375
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:39,344
Niangniang,

376
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:46,600
congratulations,you've given born to a princess. She is doing well and is so beautiful!

377
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:50,024
Young Mistress, you gave me a shock.<br>You were unconscious for quite some time.

378
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:52,106
I'll pour a cup of tea for you right away.

379
00:33:53,705 --> 00:33:56,437
Niangniang. Come, carry her over.

380
00:33:56,437 --> 00:33:58,464
Let Niangniang take a look at the princess.

381
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:06,378
This is the princess' wet nurse.

382
00:34:10,993 --> 00:34:12,368
The princess was born premature.

383
00:34:12,748 --> 00:34:15,927
The Imperial Physician has visited. <br>He said she need lots of care.

384
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:24,678
Young Mistress, His Majesty is here.

385
00:34:27,424 --> 00:34:28,909
His Majesty has arrived!

386
00:34:33,616 --> 00:34:36,951
Peace upon Your Majesty.

387
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

388
00:34:39,473 --> 00:34:42,949
-All of you, get up.<br>-Thank you, Your Majesty.

389
00:34:47,623 --> 00:34:51,545
Imperial Concubine Wan, have you still not come to terms with it?

390
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:55,067
Your Majesty, what do you want me to come to terms with?

391
00:34:57,667 --> 00:35:00,513
You've already given birth to a princess for me.

392
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,700
Are you still going to do things out of anger?

393
00:35:05,226 --> 00:35:10,305
I've decided that regardless of what happens to the Zhen family, it will not implicate you.

394
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,464
As long as you are willing,

395
00:35:13,908 --> 00:35:17,424
I can confer the title of Consort on you tomorrow.

396
00:35:18,026 --> 00:35:21,545
I've fallen from favor. <br>I dare not take up a Consort's position.

397
00:35:23,786 --> 00:35:30,950
Huanhuan, if you're willing, <br>you're still my favored concubine.

398
00:35:31,307 --> 00:35:34,265
I will still treat you the same way as I did in the past.

399
00:35:35,386 --> 00:35:36,522
In the past...

400
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:44,300
Does Your Majesty think that we can still return to the past?

401
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:06,826
Indeed, I've given in to you too much.

402
00:36:09,226 --> 00:36:13,985
This obstinacy of yours does not fit in the palace.

403
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,426
Thank you, Your Majesty.

404
00:36:18,305 --> 00:36:21,465
Go to the shrine and meditate. <br>You don't need to live here anymore.

405
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:27,192
That's right. I don't need to live here.

406
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,616
If the Princess were to have a mother like me,

407
00:36:32,145 --> 00:36:34,149
and such a family clan that is in such dire straits,

408
00:36:35,073 --> 00:36:37,910
she will be implicated and suffer a hard life.

409
00:36:42,307 --> 00:36:44,066
I would like to leave.

410
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:50,638
As for the child's name, <br>please permit me to choose it.

411
00:36:52,266 --> 00:36:53,744
Your Majesty, please permit it.

412
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:54,785
Very well.

413
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,300
She'll be called...<br>Wanwan.

414
00:37:02,144 --> 00:37:03,351
Wanwan?

415
00:37:03,613 --> 00:37:08,156
How could I be so disrespectful to allow the little princess to share the name of the previous Empress?

416
00:37:12,556 --> 00:37:16,792
What I'm unable to accomplish, let the princess do it.

417
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,800
I'll pray for her at the temple

418
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:24,916
for the rest of my life

419
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:31,036
It's fine if you don't want to go to the temple

420
00:37:31,823 --> 00:37:33,556
Baohua Hall in the palace...

421
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,716
No, this unfortunate aura of mine...

422
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,041
has disturbed the peace in the palace.

423
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,900
It's good if you leave sooner too. <br>The palace won't keep you.

424
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:56,478
-Niangniang.<br>-Young Mistress.

425
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,800
I have one more favor to beg of you.

426
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,724
Say it.

427
00:38:06,758 --> 00:38:08,396
After I leave the palace,

428
00:38:08,798 --> 00:38:11,837
I hope to have Consort Jin bring the princess up.

429
00:38:13,437 --> 00:38:17,638
If that can be so, I will harbor no regrets.

430
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:24,277
Consort Duan has already taken Wenyi under her wing. <br>Consort Jin can have this responsibility.

431
00:38:26,158 --> 00:38:32,537
The moonlight is dim. Let the princess's name be Longyue.

432
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,236
Princesses are only titled at the Full Month.

433
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,572
Longyue received this honor the moment she was born.

434
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:45,316
I thank Your Majesty for this favor shown.

435
00:38:47,002 --> 00:38:49,716
Do you have anything else to say to me?

436
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:56,320
Strings break, Mirror imperfect

437
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,689
Dews sob, stops when it's time.

438
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:04,796
Recite when old, Sad farewell

439
00:39:06,237 --> 00:39:08,679
Please eat well, no need to miss me.

440
00:39:09,798 --> 00:39:11,400
Time keeps moving on,

441
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,600
it's time for an everlasting parting with you

442
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,046
Fine. Fine.

443
00:39:34,362 --> 00:39:37,080
Since that is the case, I have nothing to say either.

444
00:39:37,478 --> 00:39:39,639
Your intention to leave is firm.

445
00:39:39,997 --> 00:39:45,642
As for Longyue, Consort Jin and I will take good care of her.

446
00:39:51,317 --> 00:39:52,342
Niangniang.

447
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:53,598
Young Mistress.

448
00:39:54,054 --> 00:39:57,155
Meimei, why did you do that?
