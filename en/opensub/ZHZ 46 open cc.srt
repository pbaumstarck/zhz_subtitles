00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Episode 46

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,700
Xiao Yun Zi can never leave the Forbidden City

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,200
I have already arranged for you to serve Lady Hui.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,700
Ping Er will serve Imperial Consort Jing.

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,400
Liu Zhu is dead. Huan Bi, if you wishes to stay behind in the palace.

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,900
I can also make arrangements for you.

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,200
To serve Lady Hui or Imperial Consort Jing.

8
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:38,589
As for Jing Xi,

9
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:41,422
You previously served Dowager Empress.

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,900
Why don't you go back to serve her?

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,900
As for the rest of you

12
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:49,372
You will be reassigned.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,500
I don't want to serve anyone else. I have already resolved to serve you.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,800
I only have you my Lady, my only kin. Liu Zhu is already dead.

15
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,912
I want to be together with my lady.

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,200
and never part.

17
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:06,327
Why make things difficult for yourself?

18
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:08,902
Your servant has been able to leave the forbidden city since age 25,

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,700
but in this world, your servant is all alone without a family.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,523
therefore your servant and huan bi

21
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,122
want to stay with you my lady

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,400
Even if we are in a temple,

23
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:24,741
at least there would be company.

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,100
If you're not afraid of suffering,

25
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,600
I can't bear to be without you guys either.

26
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,100
Little sister

27
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,900
Is this really your only option?

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,900
Every day longer that I am in the forbidden city,

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,700
will only endanger the princess.

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,600
From now on,

31
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,400
Older sister

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,000
will be the princess's mother.

33
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,000
Rest assured

34
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,149
I will take care of her as my own

35
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:27,873
Long Yue is sister's child

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,100
Of course you would treat as your own child (saying that she is already the princess's only mother)

37
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,900
I trust that older sister will take care of the princess.

38
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:38,483
I know. You could have entrusted this child to anyone

39
00:02:38,563 --> 00:02:39,837
to raise

40
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:43,221
but you entrusted her to my care for my sake because I don't have any children to depend on

41
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,300
I beseech sister to think of old ties

42
00:02:53,742 --> 00:02:55,416
and help me to take care of sister mei

43
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:58,019
Don't worry about it

44
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:04,946
Leave right now, before I regret my decision

45
00:03:22,057 --> 00:03:25,530
My lady, the jade shoes that his majesty gave can be brought along

46
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:29,658
I don't want anything

47
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,122
Just bring some of the usual clothing and item

48
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:38,822
so that I can bring along my memories

49
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:43,297
My lady, the items that his majesty gifted

50
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,000
are in this cabinet

51
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:50,250
Lock it up. The internal affairs department will clear it up

52
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:59,892
The carriage will be here soon. You should probably change now.

53
00:04:18,294 --> 00:04:19,618
Please make an exception.

54
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:21,175
Let me have a word with my lady.

55
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,400
Make it quick. We have a schedule to follow.

56
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,800
Huan Er.

57
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,700
My lady, don't worry. Uncle zhen is already much better

58
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,800
and able to eat normally

59
00:04:43,803 --> 00:04:46,093
I believe he has recuperated.

60
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:50,264
Once my father recover, It won't be convenient for him to remain in the capital

61
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:52,302
just in case

62
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,800
His majesty has the same sentiment

63
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,000
After your father gets better

64
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,900
he will immediately leave the capital, sent to exile in ninb bo ta

65
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,460
I know

66
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
the emperor will not change his mind

67
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:08,102
since your going

68
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,897
might as well treat this as a relief of burden

69
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:16,574
Sister you take care. I'm afraid

70
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:17,930
I will no longer have the chance to see you again

71
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,900
You leaving me alone behind

72
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:25,537
what meaning is there in staying behind for me

73
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:31,058
I wish I was sent away together with you

74
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:32,824
sister don't put it this way

75
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:36,651
sister as long as you're in the palace

76
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,300
you must be wary of An De Rong and the empress

77
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:43,576
Don't get emotional because of me

78
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,300
its more important to ensure your own survival

79
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,000
Ok.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,100
Lord Wen. My sister is all alone

81
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,100
I entrust her in your care. Stay safe

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,600
Don't fall prey into others's trap

83
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:06,472
Lady Wan Ping. You take care too

84
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:09,825
Whenever I get the chance. I will pay you a visit

85
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,800
Once I enter the monastery

86
00:06:14,318 --> 00:06:16,232
My lord you will be somebody from the forbidden palace

87
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,300
please don't come and visit me

88
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,600
if my lord, you really have the heart

89
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:24,733
please look her the princess on my behalf and sister mei

90
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:27,628
that is my only wish

91
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:30,187
your highness please speak no more

92
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,200
let's go

93
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,760
Young mistress, we've arrived.

94
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:07,549
my lady, the wind in October has already turn cold

95
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,700
my lady has just given bith

96
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:11,301
its better not to catch a cold

97
00:08:13,022 --> 00:08:16,496
benefactor are you from the palace?

98
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:19,702
the abbot has already instructed us

99
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,300
to show you inside

100
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,700
Thank you.

101
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,200
you have come

102
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,900
sorry to make you wait

103
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,600
no problem no problem

104
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,400
my name is jing an

105
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,700
instruction came from the palace saying my lady has yet to taken the tonsure

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,700
even so

107
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,700
regulation must be abide by

108
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,900
Yes.

109
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,800
now that you have join us

110
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,200
you are no longer a member of the forbidden palace

111
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,800
naturally you must be away from worldly affairs

112
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,189
you can no longer use your name

113
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,700
you should follow the others using the word mo

114
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,600
between your brow you still have a lot of worries

115
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,000
you shall be name mo cho

116
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,300
thank you for the abbot's effort

117
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,000
I shall accept it in my heart

118
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,300
now that you're entering to practice in the monastery, you shouldn't have followers to serve you

119
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,300
but since the palace has given special instruction

120
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,000
as you were a royal concubine previously

121
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,500
sin sin...

122
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:38,393
since your are the first precedence

123
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,700
the two of you shall stay by the lady side

124
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,600
thank you for understanding abbot

125
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,900
mandarin's dew can quench worldly woes

126
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,400
now that you are away from the red city (referring to forbidden palace)

127
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,000
you should abandon all your woes

128
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
this person here is jing bai

129
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,100
she is in charge of all things in this monastery

130
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,000
if you have anything in future, feel free to look for her

131
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,300
its getting late

132
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,000
you should take a rest

133
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
thank you abbot for your arrangement

134
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,900
please follow me

135
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,300
this is the place

136
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,300
tidy up the place yourself

137
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,900
my lady have a seat

138
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,100
my lady take a seat first I will go unpack the clothes

139
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,100
what is there to unpack

140
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,900
its just a few clothing items

141
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,900
my lady's Buddhist name is indeed special

142
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,900
mo cho, doesn't sound like the typical Buddhist name

143
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,300
on the other hand it sounds more like lady's name from the harem

144
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,600
the abbot is trying to tell me

145
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,100
since i'm here

146
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,000
I should not dwell on the past

147
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,400
that's true

148
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,900
from now onwards

149
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I can only pray daily

150
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,300
I hope my father, mother, yu rao, rong yu

151
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,000
can be safe

152
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,900
this is my only wish

153
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,500
this is also my only wish

154
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,900
what wrong my lady?

155
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:02,366
your don't look too good

156
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,600
my lady has just went through labor

157
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,200
i'm afraid its because of the long journey

158
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,900
what should we do

159
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,800
let find some red sugar to mix with hot water

160
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,200
forget it, where can you find red sugar here

161
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:18,875
I shall bear with it

162
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,300
how can you do that. sickness in confinement cannot be taken lightly

163
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,300
if not well taken care of you might suffer in the long term

164
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,100
how about this

165
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,300
you take good care of my lady, I will go next door to borrow from the other nuns

166
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,300
alright

167
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,100
my lady, you should take a rest

168
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,600
master, do you have red sugar?

169
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,600
master, do you have red sugar?

170
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,200
can I get some from you?

171
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,300
jing bai master, may I ask if there is any red sugar nearby?

172
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,700
zhen huan lady has just went through labor recently

173
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,300
im afraid because of the journey she has caught a cold

174
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,600
jing bai mast...

175
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,600
what the...

176
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,700
they said there isn't any red sugar

177
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,700
nobody gives a shit about us

178
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:23,354
the abbot mention previously, this practice originated because of Royal Concubine Su

179
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,800
how fast the abbot has changed her attitude towards us

180
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,600
there's not even hot soup nor hot water available

181
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
looks like there another empty room over that side

182
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:33,110
I wonder which sire lives there

183
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,000
I shall go try my luck again, take good care of my lady in my absense

184
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,500
master...

185
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,100
who are you!

186
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,500
master...

187
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,500
did you just went through labor?

188
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,200
yes I did

189
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,300
it has already been the seventh day

190
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,600
when bother to go through labor for those digusting men

191
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,600
you deserve it

192
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
this should be enough for your consumption

193
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,500
stop bothering us with your petite issues

194
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,000
you.. RED SUAGR!?

195
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
there's at least 2 jin (1kg)

196
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,500
really...

197
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,200
I thought those that took tonsure are righteous...

198
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,000
how come the nuns here are so obnoxious

199
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
they are entirely different from those in the palace

200
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,100
we have been dispose and chase out of the palace

201
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,300
without power nor influence

202
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,800
being cast aside is expected

203
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,100
just now this nun

204
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,300
through her words are spiteful and she appears cold

205
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,000
but she has a warm heart

206
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,000
the princess is really precious and lovely, just like her mother

207
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,300
in future, long yue's mother is concubine jing

208
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
I have already

209
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,800
dispose of concubine's wan title and position

210
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,500
chase out of the palace

211
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,500
plant in a monastery outside of the capital to practice

212
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,500
since she has already given birth to the princess

213
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,500
why is she so stubborn

214
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,035
she wants to break ties with me

215
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,700
I shall let her be

216
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,100
that would at least spare the princess from this kind of mother

217
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,600
and learn the wrong things

218
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,700
your right

219
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,600
duan concubine has already raise wen yi princess

220
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,700
jing concubine can be consider a reliable person

221
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,000
oh right your majesty...

222
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,700
after wan consort leaves the palace, there will be fewer imperial concubine

223
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,300
since the birth of the princess this happy occasion

224
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,600
we should promote a few ladies

225
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,100
who do you think is suitable

226
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,300
noble lady qi's father has credit

227
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,700
on top of that he is a Manchu flag noble. she is the right candidate

228
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,300
don't you think that noble lady hui can also be promote

229
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,700
wan ping left the palace because her temperament is stubborn

230
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,900
as your majesty consort, it is of utmost importance that she is understanding, docile and obedient

231
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Noble lady hui is also of stubborn temperament

232
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,000
from the way I see things, she is still not ready to be promote yet

233
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,900
do as you deem fit

234
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,100
what's going on?

235
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,900
smoke all over the place

236
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,700
jing bai nun is distributing the winter's charcoal wood. but there isn't our share

237
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,400
she just threw us some dry wood

238
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,200
and want us to process it charcoal wood

239
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,000
how can this be

240
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,700
no pre made charcoal wood?

241
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,011
yes there is

242
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,400
but is mo cho on order to practice here

243
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,000
or to enjoy here?

244
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,000
jing bai nun

245
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,100
to process the drywood this way, how long will it take us

246
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,600
our lady ever since her labor has yet to recover

247
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,700
can you please make some concession and take care of us for two days

248
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:29,400
at the very least our lady is here on orders to practice

249
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,500
on order to practice?!

250
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,100
that is just for outsiders to believe

251
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,100
for the people in our monastery

252
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,600
there no need for such words

253
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,100
as the saying goes. you can hide from the higher brass but not to those below

254
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,100
you think we are all idiiots

255
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,800
who doesn't know mo cho is chased out from the palace

256
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,900
I have a better solution

257
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,400
there is tons of firewood back in the woods

258
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,300
you can go ahead and chop down some to make charcoal

259
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,500
this is no palace

260
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,300
you can whatever you want

261
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,400
your lady is no longer an imperial concubine

262
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,300
you got to know where you stand

263
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,000
my lady

264
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,300
my lady

265
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
rely on yourself instead on other

266
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,100
that's right

267
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,000
my lady has always has a weak constitution

268
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,500
how can you take on this toll

269
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,500
whats more my lady is not used to these chores

270
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,400
no matter how spoil I am . its already a thing of the pass

271
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,100
this bai nun has hinted her displeasure

272
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,400
I cant just watch you guys suffer in silence

273
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,100
I shall do it myself

274
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,000
my lady you shouldn't do this!

275
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,500
don't touch it

276
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,200
since my lady has put it this way

277
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,900
there is nothing that we can say

278
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,400
but this one thing

279
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,600
my lady hasn't recover still yet

280
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,100
if you can move about

281
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,200
go pick up some small twig

282
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,700
for things like chopping of woods and burning them

283
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,900
leave it to us

284
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,200
alright

285
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,600
come

286
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,300
greetings your majesty

287
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,800
get up

288
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,900
ok

289
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,600
take a seat

290
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,200
now that your busy with the harem

291
00:19:43,246 --> 00:19:44,689
don't tire yourself out

292
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,600
thank you mother for your concern

293
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
imperial concubine an and qi are they doing well satisfying the emperor?

294
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,200
they are doing great

295
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,200
that is good to hear

296
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,000
its time to place some reliable person close to the emperor

297
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,300
their personality has to be gentle and docile

298
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,500
otherwise they be all like wan consort

299
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:04,465
that will make his majesty upset

300
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,400
let bygones be bygones

301
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,400
being dispose and leaving the palace

302
00:20:12,436 --> 00:20:15,479
in this lifetime, she wouldn't be able to come back

303
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,600
if you have the time, look out more for the people under you

304
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,100
don't slip up

305
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,700
I will remember mother's teaching

306
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,500
fang ruo

307
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,400
how come fang ruo is with you mother?

308
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,500
isn't she suppose to server his majesty instead?

309
00:20:41,003 --> 00:20:43,472
fang ruo is wan consort's tutor

310
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:46,172
his majesty held a grudge

311
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,800
thus he replace her

312
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,200
based from her previous performance

313
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,400
I keep her here to serve

314
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,100
oh right

315
00:20:57,109 --> 00:21:00,532
his majesty said that the northern empire because of the winter is in ruin

316
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:02,981
he's afraid it might affect the coming harvest

317
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,700
let the harem prepare an offering

318
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,100
how does the empress plan to go about it?

319
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,703
the palace always pray in bao hua room

320
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,700
im thinking to wait until spring then make an offering at gan lu temple

321
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,300
one, we can save on the expenditure of hiring nun to come in the palace

322
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,500
two. I can also bring all the concubine out of the palace

323
00:21:23,503 --> 00:21:24,982
to show off our sincerity

324
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
are you adamant on going?

325
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,700
I will follow your wishes

326
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,300
oh well

327
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,900
you know what your doing, we shall do it your way

328
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,400
hold it right there

329
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,500
jing bai nun

330
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,500
these firewood that you pick how is it useable?

331
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,700
these firewood must be from hill behind

332
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
only judging them from their length and thickness

333
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,700
but their water content is high, they are the most unsuitable for firewood

334
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,700
I thought you are smart from first impression

335
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,700
but who knows your just a stupid woman

336
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,000
I wonder if the ladies from the palace

337
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,700
all lacks the knowledge of survivability

338
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,700
being bask in a life of luxury

339
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
chief is right

340
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,200
look at her foxy looks

341
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,700
how would she know how to differentiate the firewoods

342
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,700
she only know how to use her looks to make others pity her

343
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,700
she thinks shes still in the palace

344
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,000
I bet in the palace she just a vixen that smith the emepror

345
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
amitaha

346
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,765
gogo...

347
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,700
the sight of you irks me. (she's just jealous -.-)

348
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,900
you pick some more then come back

349
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,900
otherwise no dinner for you

350
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,600
dinner is going to be ready, where are you going?

351
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,600
there is not enough firewood, im going to get some more

352
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,200
you cant just go on an empty stomach

353
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,600
go after you eat finish

354
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,500
forget it, go early come back early

355
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,400
your not in good health let me accompany you

356
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:09,916
shhhh!! whats wrong??

357
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,600
she pinch you again didn't she?

358
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,300
other humiliate you, don't you know how to retaliate?

359
00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:17,950
im the cause of it

360
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,200
it should be fine after applying some ointment

361
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:22,372
don't you know you can report to the abbot?

362
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,000
lets not kick up a fuss.

363
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,900
don't say anymore of this

364
00:23:37,787 --> 00:23:39,994
greetings to your majesty

365
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,400
its already so late. what are you guys over here for?

366
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,500
you may rise

367
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,700
thank you your majesty

368
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,000
grant seat

369
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,900
i heard your majesty is busy lately because of the planning for the trip to gan lu temple

370
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,300
i came over specially to see if there is anything that your majesty needs help with

371
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,200
are you worry that i will place qi fu li in gan lu temple?

372
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,700
your majesty is wise. your servant is slow

373
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:12,033
Indeed my heart has doubt

374
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,100
I'm doing this because I know that in the emperor's heart

375
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,300
still can't let go of Zhen Huan

376
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,000
Zhen Huan has already been expelled from the Palace, her family exiled to Ning Gu Ta.

377
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,500
What else is there to worry about?

378
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,600
With how much attention the Emperor pays to Princess Long Yue, it is a rather unpleasant surprise.

379
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,800
And now even Fang Rou has been shooed out from the Hall of Mental Cultivation.

380
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,500
The Emperor has no one by his side to serve him.

381
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,700
She's only a lowly palace maid. Can hardly be considered a big problem.

382
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,400
Fang Rou was Zhen Huan's ettiquette teacher.

383
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,900
The Emperor is doing this because he can't let go

384
00:24:43,945 --> 00:24:46,950
That's why he doesn't want Fang Rou around him.

385
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,000
Even Hui Precious knows

386
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,100
After Zhen Huan left the palace, the Emperor hasn't wanted to see her.

387
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,600
Even when he goes to Xian Fu Palace to see Concubine Jing.

388
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,300
He wouldn't even consider making a detour to visit the neighboring Hall of Chrysanthemum.

389
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,900
It's just as well that the Zhen family has no relatives in the capital.

390
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,600
Zhen Huan is helpless. Even presuming she wants to return, she won't be able to.

391
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:10,069
Though that is the case, I still can't help but worry.

392
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,900
Zhen Yuan Dao has good fortunes and has arrived alive at Ning Gu Ta.

393
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:15,869
Beyond the reach of our power.

394
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:21,300
Rather, we should properly crush the weeds that are before us.

395
00:25:21,524 --> 00:25:23,463
Your highness show great foresight.

396
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,000
We will leave them behind in our dust.

397
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,900
Jian Qiu, bring me my red jade necklace.

398
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:31,918
Yes.

399
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,200
Niang Niang

400
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,000
This red jade necklace was a tribute from a foreign country.

401
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,900
I found this color to be young and fashionable

402
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,500
But I'm afraid that it's too flashy for me.

403
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,100
But it seems very suitable for you Imperial Consort Qi

404
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,000
Thank you Empress

405
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,600
This red jade sure smells lovely,

406
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,500
I believe it must be a very special scent.

407
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,100
I wouldn't give you guys something that's isn't good.

408
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,000
Since Huan Er left the capital

409
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,500
You have been very low spirited.

410
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,700
It's been 3 months since we've bid farewell.

411
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,700
I'm worried about Huan Er's situation outside the palace.

412
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,300
If it's possible, I am willing

413
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,000
To visit on your behalf, my lady

414
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,896
However, Gan Lu Temple is a temple where numerous nun's reside

415
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,100
Even if I wanted to go, I am unable to.

416
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,100
If someone questions you

417
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,100
Say that I ordered you to go

418
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,700
It seems like I will not be able to leave this Forbidden City.

419
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:51,993
I hope you can visit her frequently.

420
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,700
I humbly accept your order.

421
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,500
Of course, you also need to avoid arousing suspicion

422
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,900
Don't stay for too long

423
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,400
Yes, I understand.

424
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,100
Aiya!

425
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,700
My lady, your frostbite is starting to relapse again.

426
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,900
This year, it seems to be swelling even more.

427
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,300
It seems like there are some things that you can't forget even if you want to.

428
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,800
Just like this frostbite. Relapses every year.

429
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,200
This pair of hands is full of frostbites

430
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,400
Red, blue, purple

431
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,500
My lady, look. These red ones are coral

432
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,600
The blue ones are Green Jade

433
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,716
And these purple ones are Amethysts.

434
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,300
When this lowly servant first entered the palace,

435
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,500
I was a lowly palace made who made wine and swept floors。

436
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,600
As we were new to the palace, it was inevitable to be bullied.

437
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:58,821
During winter, we had to wash the older maid's cloths

438
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,800
Our hands were full of frostbite

439
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,700
At that time, Empress Chun Yuan

440
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,800
was still Prince Yong's legal first wife.

441
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
When she came to greet the Dowager Empress

442
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,600
When she saw my hands, she said you pitiful girl

443
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,700
Your hands have become so frostbitten but how come you're still washing cloths

444
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,700
So then,

445
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,200
Internal affairs transferred me to do other jobs

446
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,900
But lucky that at the time I learnt how to do these heavy chores

447
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,500
Or else, I won't be able to serve you well right now my lady.

448
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,900
Here, let me help you.

449
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,100
You shouldn't

450
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,300
Little sister Huan

451
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,000
Lord Wen

452
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,700
How can you do these heavy chores?

453
00:28:40,723 --> 00:28:42,992
I'm only someone who's in training.

454
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,800
What is there I can't do?

455
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,900
It's enough, it's enough

456
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:55,033
There's already enough water for today.

457
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,400
Today's water?

458
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,000
Don't tell me, that you're being worked this hard everyday?

459
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,000
Everything

460
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,500
Is done by ourselves for our own gain

461
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,300
This is nothing

462
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,900
Everyday, my lady has to join us in chopping wood and warming water.

463
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,400
Washing cloths, cooking

464
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,200
I don't mind me and Jin Xi working

465
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,700
Cause it is our duty

466
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,700
However, our lady's hands

467
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,600
It's nothing

468
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,800
Let me see. Let me see.

469
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,000
Lord Wen

470
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,800
Please allow me.

471
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,100
Here, rub some on.

472
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,600
Here, allow me

473
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,100
Allow me.

474
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,100
Since I've left the palace

475
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,900
Is sister Mei well?

476
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,500
Is Long Yue well?

477
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,900
You promised me

478
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,700
that you would look after them

479
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,500
My lady and the princess are all well

480
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,500
My lady is worried about you so she thought of a way to allow me to visit you.

481
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,800
As long as they're well, then I can be at ease.

482
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,100
I don't have any other talents

483
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,996
Whomever you wish for me to take care of

484
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,300
I will do my best to make sure that they are well cared for.

485
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,800
Many thanks

486
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,600
You and I don't need to say thanks

487
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,500
There's only this much of this medication left.

488
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:24,194
You will have to make do with this for now

489
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,983
I will bring some better ones with me the next time I visit

490
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,300
Many thanks.

491
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,900
Hurry up your with your work

492
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
Hurry up

493
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:40,781
Make sure to clean the temple rooms and the gardens properly

494
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,800
It's this late and you've only just returned from chopping wood?

495
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,400
You must have gone to be lazy somewhere

496
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,600
Bring over the bucket

497
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,900
Go

498
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,100
Scrub the floor of the temple rooms clean

499
00:31:09,422 --> 00:31:11,939
Scrubbing the floor is the most tormenting job

500
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:15,021
Can't straighten your waist. Can't lift your head either.

501
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,700
The temple is also so expansive

502
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:20,792
After a few hours all the bones in the body feel like they've scattered

503
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,600
It seems like Jing Bai sure knows how to torment people

504
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,500
I heard in a few days

505
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,000
We're praying for a prince and princess from the palace.

506
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,400
Mo Cho also gave birth to a princess

507
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,200
She doesn't have a place in the prays

508
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,700
Her? She's a abandoned slut

509
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,600
She's even more lowly than us. As if she's worthy enough to go pray.

510
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,000
So right.

511
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,500
Jin Xi, I'm fine

512
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,700
It's me.

513
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,900
Duke Guo

514
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,000
I came late

515
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,600
When did you return?

516
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,664
Three days ago

517
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,500
Emperor brother ordered me to return to the capital.

518
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,700
This place isn't convenient to talk

519
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,200
Let us find a place to talk

520
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,100
I never got to say thank you to you

521
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,900
I felt very guilty

522
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,200
I only did what I could do

523
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,000
But I wasn't even much help

524
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,500
I feel very ashamed

525
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,500
If you mention thanking me again

526
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,500
I will feel even more guilt ridden

527
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,300
I ended up in this position because I'm not the type of person who want to cause harm to a person.

528
00:32:55,322 --> 00:32:57,575
Because you helped the Zhen family deliver our letter

529
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,200
You've were sent off to Mukden Palace (Shenyang Imperial Palace).

530
00:32:59,235 --> 00:33:00,917
This few month

531
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,800
I'm the one who has caused troubles for you

532
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,900
Please don't say that

533
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,200
Since my return to the capital, Emperor brother has treated me like he always has.

534
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,800
I'm still Duke Guo.

535
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:10,041
Things are no different from before.

536
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
You don't need to worry about it.

537
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,500
My trip to Mukden Palace this time

538
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,400
It's just like that time when I was sent to Shu Zhong (a place in shi chuan province)

539
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:19,856
Just sight seeing.

540
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,100
It's called reflecting one's action as an excuse only

541
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,600
It's just a bluff

542
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,800
But it's still due to troubles caused by my family

543
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,100
If you continue to say this,

544
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,600
I won't dare to tell you why I'm here today

545
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,900
Please speak my lord.

546
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,800
Two days ago when I was at the Palace.

547
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,400
I suddenly met one person

548
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,500
So thus, I returned and drew a portrait.

549
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,500
My lady, please help me evaluate

550
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,900
and advise me on my technique.

551
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,200
I'm no expert at calligraphy drawing

552
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
How would I be able to advise you my lord?

553
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,300
This is Imperial Consort Jing.

554
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,700
This is sister Mei.

555
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,600
This is

556
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,000
My first time meeting Princess Long Yue

557
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:08,636
So I drew this portrait

558
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,300
This is to express my gratitude at being her royal uncle.

559
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,100
It's only been such a short time

560
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,500
Long Yue has grown so big already

561
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,700
Children always grow particularly fast

562
00:34:22,714 --> 00:34:24,605
I hear that in a while

563
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,900
Princess Long Yue will turn one

564
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,500
I thought that my lady, you being the mother of Princess Long Yue

565
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,300
will naturally want to know how your own child is doing.

566
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,100
My lord, your picture is better than a stranger's thousand spoken words.

567
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,400
Thank you your highness for your kindness

568
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,300
I very fond of Princess Long Yue

569
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,100
Luckily my humble pen are able to draw some decent strokes.

570
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,000
How about this. In the future,

571
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,400
I'll bring you a drawing every two month

572
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,700
And let lady to evaluate.

573
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,400
My lady, what do you think about this idea?

574
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:56,592
Many thanks.

575
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,500
Over there is the Piao Miao Peaks (It is a peak in Shan Xi province that is a major attraction for tourists).

576
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,000
My summer home is over there.

577
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,400
Every month, I usually spend ten or so days there

578
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,100
In the future, if there's anything you need help with my lady

579
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:14,334
just send someone over to inform me.

580
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,100
I will do what I can

581
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,300
To be able to see this drawing of Princess Long Yue

582
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,600
I'm already very touched. I have nothing more to ask for.

583
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,400
I say this because

584
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,700
There is something I would like your ladyship to help me with

585
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,000
When Princess Long Yue turns one

586
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,900
there will be a celebration feast in the palace.

587
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,900
At that time, I hope your ladyship will be able to lend me a helping hand

588
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,500
As her royal uncle, I need to

589
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,000
present her with some cloths as a birthday gift

590
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,300
How every my embroiderers

591
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,000
aren't very talented

592
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,300
so I can only ask for your assistance with this my lady.

593
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,600
Really?

594
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,200
Can I really personally make cloths for Long Yue?

595
00:36:04,272 --> 00:36:05,767
You're her mother,

596
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,800
it's only natural the cloths you make will fit her the best.

597
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,700
Written on this piece of paper are the measurements of Long Yue

598
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,708
Five days before Long Yue's birthdate,

599
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,600
I will personally come collect it

600
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,700
I will await here for your ladyship.

601
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,200
It is still early,

602
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,400
even if you take time making it, you will be able to make it in time.

603
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,600
Long Yue is clever and cute

604
00:36:37,643 --> 00:36:39,947
She's very affectionate with you

605
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,500
Most definitely.

606
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:44,785
I heard when Long Yue first came here, she couldn't drink her fill of milk.

607
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,000
Cause of this, Imperial Consort Jing got so angry at the wet nurse.

608
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And then, even though a new wet nurse was hired,

609
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:51,720
However, Imperial Consort Jing still personally

610
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,200
made sure that the princess was well fed and lulled the princess to sleep.

611
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,800
It's only natural that the princess is so affectionate to Imperial Consort Jing isn't it?

612
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:59,323
The Princess's closest person is Your Majesty

613
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,100
Your Majesty please look. Even though I am holding her,

614
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,316
however her little eyes are always looking towards you Your Majesty.

615
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,500
You're right, she is always looking at us.

616
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,300
Children always very closely resemble both parent.

617
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,100
When the Princess looks at Your Majesty, she's also seeing herself.

618
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,700
Her eyebrows and nose resembles us,

619
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,900
the rest of her features all look more beautiful than us.

620
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,900
You're right. Princess Long Yue's mouth and chin

621
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,500
really resembles Lady Wan. It looks near the exact same.

622
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,100
Who did you say she looks like?

623
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,900
I...I said the Princess resembles her mother.

624
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,700
The Princess only has one mother.

625
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,300
and no other.

626
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,300
Your Majesty, please cease to be angry. I understand my error.

627
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,000
I will never make this error again.

628
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,700
We welcome Royal Empress. We welcome all Young Mistresses.

629
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,500
You can all rise.

630
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:53,893
Yes.

631
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,600
How goes all the preparations for the prays?

632
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,800
All has been prepared properly.

633
00:38:58,817 --> 00:39:01,259
My ladyship, please enter the main hall and light the incense.

634
00:39:01,266 --> 00:39:03,101
Please lead the way master.
