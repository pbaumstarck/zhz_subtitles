00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Episode 47

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,800
Your Highness, please pay your tributes.

3
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,200
Royal Concubine Jing and Royal Concubine Qi, please pay your tributes.

4
00:00:33,687 --> 00:00:37,122
Lady An and Lady Qi, please pay your tributes

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,100
Lady Hui and Lady Xin, please pay your tributes.

6
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,000
How audacious! Who is it hiding here so suspiciously?

7
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,400
This lowly wife greets you Your Highness Empress and Young Mistresses.

8
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,923
Amitabah, and here I was being worried who it was.

9
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,900
It was only Lady Wan.

10
00:01:49,164 --> 00:01:52,681
Oh wait, you're no longer Lady Wan. How does one address you now?

11
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,600
This lowly is known as Mo Chou of the Gan Luo Temple.

12
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,100
Mo Chou (one who has no worries) is true.

13
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,800
But how come you address yourself as lowly wife ("I" used by ladies) and not this lowly one ("I" used by nuns)

14
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,200
So you rather yourself to be a lowly wife

15
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,700
than being in your place and offering your prays to buddha.

16
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,600
Also Mo Chou is someone in training as her hair isn't shaved yet so she's not truly a nun yet.

17
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,000
Well thank you for the concern, you are treating Mo Chou so good.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,600
My sister was so careless, and she stepped on Mo Chou's hand, are you okay?

19
00:02:26,482 --> 00:02:28,442
No problem no problem

20
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,700
Mo Chou does heavy works all the time, stepped on hand is a piece of cake to her.

21
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:35,088
heavy works?

22
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,720
Yes

23
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:40,833
She was not born from the rich after all, and she has to cut firewood, wash and starch, grazing and so on.

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,700
Has no different to the other girls in the temple.

25
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,600
Mo Chow used to belong to palace, being like it, it's so grievance.

26
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:58,995
It should, entering to temple means to get everything behind.

27
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:01,833
Buddhism said everyone is equal

28
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:05,072
Lady Mo Chou should do the same

29
00:03:05,713 --> 00:03:07,193
Your are right

30
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:09,065
Queen Godness

31
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:12,350
Mo Chou is taken out for practice by Emperor after all

32
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:14,552
and she is the princes bio-mother as well

33
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:17,873
You know she is weak by just looking at her.

34
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,545
But in the temple

35
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,500
Even ask her to do all kinds of heavy works, it is too harsh on her.

36
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,500
the queen has already said

37
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,900
You need to leave everything behind, princess is princess, Mo chow is Mo chow

38
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,700
Emperor has said princess has Lady Jing as her mother.

39
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,500
You had better not go against the Emperor's will.

40
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,010
The floor is so cold, just get up already.

41
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,700
Lady Hui, Come here. That position belongs to Mo Chow.

42
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:52,318
Go quickly. It's not a problem.

43
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:57,841
Everyone has their own position, is like human being and ghost.

44
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,962
You two can not standing together right there.

45
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Queen Goddess Although Mo Chow left palace

46
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,600
She doesn't deserve all these.

47
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,000
Buddhist takes calm as an important thing

48
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:13,080
Lady Hui, you are so impatient today

49
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:15,401
You can't go and visit Buddhist

50
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,212
Kneel here and think it through yourself

51
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:26,317
This way please

52
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,800
Be careful

53
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,631
Queen goddess should be tired today, please have a good rest.

54
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:03,400
You are usually smart, don't you see goddess today

55
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,452
is very happy?

56
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:09,685
I am not happy, I am please

57
00:05:09,718 --> 00:05:14,480
I am please Mo Chow is no longer a threat to us

58
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,716
I would not believe it unit I saw it

59
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:24,881
This is way better than letting her die

60
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:28,363
It is said that living is worse than die

61
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:35,473
I told the owner in temple before I left today, told her not to take care of Mo Chow, regardless of her live or die.

62
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:38,761
Now that Mo Chow is not a threat, but

63
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:42,395
The king hasn't let her go completely.

64
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:45,521
You two need to work harder

65
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,755
go get his heart

66
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:49,239
Yes Queen Goddess

67
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,500
Empress, are you feeling better?

68
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:00,399
This little old sickness, I've got use to it

69
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:07,801
You are caught so serious, I will go get you sth

70
00:06:07,844 --> 00:06:11,279
Why is you smelling so heavy on herbs today?

71
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:13,799
I am almost dizzy (by smelling it)

72
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,801
I've kneelled for a long time so..

73
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,481
Kneeling is kneeling

74
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:27,288
Queen Goddess is using you as an example for others.

75
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:32,601
It was my wrong doing, I deserve it

76
00:06:35,122 --> 00:06:39,363
But Mo Chow is having a hard time now, I am just worry about her.

77
00:06:39,697 --> 00:06:41,760
If you want to say something say it yourself

78
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:49,955
I hope you think of Mo Chow as princess's bio-mother

79
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,300
help her through this hardship

80
00:06:55,887 --> 00:06:58,404
Why are you treating her so well?

81
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:02,070
Yes We are living so close

82
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,900
I heard of that as well

83
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:15,723
It's not sth that matters

84
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,240
I am just feel bad about the princess, she was born without her bio-mother by her side.

85
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:26,123
Princess is even more poor than Mo chow

86
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:33,601
Everything should have a space

87
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:38,841
Ok. I will send people to see

88
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,900
I will not let Mo chow die

89
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Thank you so much, I can not wish more

90
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,900
Think of yourself more instead of others

91
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:01,599
everyone is fighting for the King's love, how long hasn't you seen the King?

92
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,162
When King is happy, he will think of me

93
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:10,079
I have another request

94
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,400
There is place left empty, can I have it?

95
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,521
You are planing to have it for her?

96
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:23,201
Ever since she is left, every one is saying there is bad luck over there.

97
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:26,355
I am living with Lady Jing now

98
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:29,160
Although it is convenient to take care of little princess

99
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,082
I think it is too narrow

100
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,440
I think it is better now to move the princess than she gets older

101
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:40,524
Please let me move over there

102
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,561
You need to think it well

103
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:48,161
If The king is still hating her

104
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:52,121
Once you get into that place, it has no difference as marginized.

105
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:58,921
When the King solve his problem it will become good

106
00:08:59,397 --> 00:09:00,759
No one can tell

107
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:07,681
If you like it you can do it

108
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:10,976
Thank you

109
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:16,520
Jin

110
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,500
Long time no see, you become more pretty now

111
00:09:22,722 --> 00:09:25,199
You are becoming better at talking, dislike!

112
00:09:28,161 --> 00:09:32,045
You said you will be coming 5 days prior to the kid's birthday but didn't tell me the exact time

113
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:35,081
So I decided to come earlier, didn't expect you to be here already

114
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:39,609
I wanted to come here earlier

115
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:41,961
If we happened to meet,

116
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,281
then it will be a surprise

117
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:46,959
If we didn't schedule a time but still run into each other

118
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:49,264
It must be fate!

119
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:57,200
To tell the truth, I don't believed in fate in relationships

120
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,356
They use the word "fate" as an excuse to get close to each other

121
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:05,111
But they also use "no fate" as an excuse to distant away from each other

122
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:11,799
I always find your words fascinating...

123
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:15,847
It always gives me surprises

124
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:18,441
Thanks for your compliment

125
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:22,322
Maybe one day when I see an end to a relationship

126
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,559
I will also use "no fate" as an excuse to end the relationship

127
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,700
If you were to be at a good time like before, these words wouldn't mean much

128
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,400
But do you still not believe in fate even when you are Buddhist now?

129
00:10:40,003 --> 00:10:43,718
Even though I believed in Buddhism, I still have my own faith

130
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:15,920
After the Emperor passed away, it has been a while since the last time I saw someone from the Palace

131
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:19,681
We have have special fate with each other, You Majesty

132
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:21,767
No only did we run into each other today,

133
00:22:21,814 --> 00:22:25,837
I also have a jin (instrument) that used to belong to you

134
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,919
Really?

135
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,401
It is in fact in the temple right now

136
00:22:33,922 --> 00:22:38,814
I remembered when I left the Palace,

137
00:22:38,841 --> 00:22:40,522
I left both instruments behind

138
00:22:41,298 --> 00:22:43,160
Since the Emperor passed away,

139
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:46,022
It would be meaningless for me to keep the instrument

140
00:22:46,086 --> 00:22:48,961
I never thought it would be passed on to you

141
00:22:52,242 --> 00:22:55,756
Since I haven't seen the instruments for years,

142
00:22:56,716 --> 00:23:01,286
If you will, can I take a look at it?

143
00:23:01,836 --> 00:23:03,973
i would,

144
00:23:04,772 --> 00:23:07,960
but few days ago I broke the strings...

145
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:11,000
If you don't mind,

146
00:23:11,604 --> 00:23:16,560
Can I take a look at it? I might be able to fix it

147
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:20,120
Sure

148
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,700
If it really can't be fixed, I would regret not being able to hear the jin's sound again

149
00:23:26,992 --> 00:23:31,322
Then next time when you come,

150
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:33,810
Please bring the jin with you

151
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:36,966
I really enjoy talking to you

152
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,419
Thanks for your invitation!

153
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:42,161
Go ahead
