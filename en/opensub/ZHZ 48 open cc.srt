00:00:00,713 --> 00:00:02,296
Episode 48

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,600
Did Ah-Jing piss you off

3
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,600
He used to be straightforward, so I won't be mad at him

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,700
I am so happy for you

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,400
I knew that you wouId say so

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Protector Pei's famiIy is renowned

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,300
AIthough he has no reaI power

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,900
But he educated his famiIy weII

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,200
His daughter must be outstanding

10
00:00:48,254 --> 00:00:50,042
Moreover, the Empress Dowager Iiks her

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,200
Jing-Xian

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,000
Her name teIIs us that she is a tender girI

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,100
CongratuIations

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,600
Are you sincerely congratulating me?

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,500
Of course

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,600
I'II do it

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,500
No matter what

18
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,300
I just want you to know that

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
I don't Iike Meng Jing-Xian at aII

20
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,100
No matter how good she is

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,600
I don't Iike her

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,800
The Empress Dowager Iikes her

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,000
You are at the age to get married too

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,500
The Empress Dowager doesn't know about it

25
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,500
But you do

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,700
Even if you don't Iike her

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,100
The empress dowager wiII choose another girI for you

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,100
Are you going to reject everyone of them?

29
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,700
The person that you Iike

30
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,100
Might not Iike you back

31
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
I am not His Majesty

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,100
My marriage doesn't reIate to the country

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,300
The empress dowager won't<br>compeI me to get married

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,600
I don't care if

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,100
The one I Iike Iikes me too

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,200
My beIief is that

37
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,600
Sincerity matters Sincerity matters

38
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,800
Perhaps it reaIIy matters, but I wiII not be moved again

39
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,100
It is not convenient for<br>men to come to GanIu TempIe

40
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't want to create rumors too

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,000
It wouId be better for us to meet Iess

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,800
If you think that I offended you

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,200
It's better from now not to see you

44
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,000
You are not

45
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,000
It's another thing

46
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,500
You are from the royaI family

47
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,200
You shouId not come here so frequentIy

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,300
You are not fit in this place

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't you want to see me?

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,100
We shouIdn't be seeing each other

51
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,100
PIease respect my decision

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,500
Since you say so

53
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,200
WeII

54
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,900
You have been

55
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,100
Coughing and

56
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,300
Not sIeeping weII since winter came

57
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,300
What shouId we do?

58
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,900
How?

59
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,600
I went to doctor Wen

60
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,100
The peopIe said

61
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,400
The sickness of empress<br>dowager has reIapsed

62
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,000
Doctor Wen is taking care of her now

63
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,600
He is not aIIowed to Ieave the paIace

64
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,900
Oh

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,200
The empress dowager's<br>heaIth is more important

66
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,600
It is normaI for doctor<br>Wen to take care of her

67
00:03:57,677 --> 00:03:59,746
Fang-Ruo can come to protect us

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,100
OnIy when the empress dowager is heaIthy

69
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,700
The medicines don't have effects

70
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,300
LuckiIy Ah-Jing sent us

71
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,200
Some nutritive bird nest

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,900
Finish them first

73
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,050
I wiII eat after I finish writing

74
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,900
I am not so weak

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,100
It is not severe

76
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,400
It is

77
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:24,930
You keep coughing

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,800
Yet Jing-Bai keeps asking you to wash the cIothes

79
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,500
I think you are exhausted

80
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,000
PIease don't taIk so much

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,700
There are many

82
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,700
Rumors about your sickness

83
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,000
Some peopIe even say that you<br>are infected by tubercuIosis

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,700
Who is the one

85
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,300
I think Mistress is tortured by them

86
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,400
GanIu TempIe shouIdn't have<br>a carrier of tubercuIosis

87
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes

88
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,000
No one wouId be dare to stay here

89
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,000
We can't Iet

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,700
The reputation of our tempIe be ruined by her

91
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:02,930
Did any doctor say that

92
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,100
She is infected by tubercuIosis?

93
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,000
Aren't you afraid of being punished by God? By spreading the rumors

94
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:08,969
You!

95
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,300
Even if it is not tubercuIosis

96
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,800
It has not much difference<br>from tubercuIosis

97
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,300
We can't toIerate

99
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,700
her anymore

100
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,700
Yes, we can't toIerate anymore

101
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,300
She is disgusting

102
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,400
It's my fauIt

103
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,600
I am unheaIthy, that I<br>bring troubIe to you

104
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,800
You shouId have Ieft

105
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,500
right

106
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,900
You shouIdn't be staying here

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,500
Yes Yes

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Look! She is a thief!

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,700
The evidence is here

110
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,900
What

111
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,500
You must have evidence

112
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,000
Since when did I steal your things?

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,200
OnIy me and the abbess eat<br>bird nest in GanIu TempIe

114
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Where did your bird nest come from?

115
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,300
Yes, where did it come from

116
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,900
The imperiaI doctor hasn't been

117
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,700
Visiting you for some days. Don't you say that he gave it to you

118
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,200
The aunty from the paIace hasn't been coming for a few months too

119
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,000
You must have stoIen it from me and the abbess

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The bird nest wouIdn't<br>appear automaticaIIy

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,900
Yes, just where did you get it from?

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,200
She goes to the room of master every time after<br>coIIecting the firewood

123
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,500
She must have stoIen it from there

124
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,200
Yes, she must be the one

125
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,600
Since you eat bird nest everday

126
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,500
You shouId have started Iooking for it

127
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,300
When it was gone

128
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,100
Why are you seeking it now, and maIigning me as a thief

129
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,700
I don't want to speak nonsense with you

130
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,600
TeII me

131
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,400
Where did it come from?

132
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,400
If you can't give me an<br>answer

133
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,600
It means you stoIe it

134
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,500
Yes

135
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,000
Can't other peopIe have bird nest too?

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,100
Other peopIe

137
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,600
Other peopIe might have their famiIy to send them something

138
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,700
But Mo-Chou was chased away from the paIace

139
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,500
How couId she have<br>such expensive bird nest

140
00:06:57,521 --> 00:06:58,617
You can't deny it

141
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,300
I wiII go and find the abbess

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,600
What's going on Why are you aII being so noisy

143
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,800
Mo-Chou is a thief<br>She stoIe our bird nest

144
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,300
Now she is infected by tubercuIosis

145
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,200
She shouIdn't stay at here

146
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:17,555
Yes

147
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,200
Enough

148
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,500
I saw how you AII tortured her

149
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Did she offend you

150
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,700
She didn't

151
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,500
She came from the paIace

152
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,800
You know weII about the attitude<br>of the peopIe from the paIace

153
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,500
If we toIerate with her

154
00:07:33,563 --> 00:07:35,721
Sooner or Iater

155
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,400
She wiII bring troubIes to us

156
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,300
Yes

157
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:41,520
Enough for you

158
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,200
Mo-Chou is pity

159
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,100
If you sympathize her

160
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,000
We wiII be pity

161
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:50,361
Yes

162
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,000
Why is your sickness so severe

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That

164
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,000
What's going on with the tubercuIosis

165
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,300
No doctor says that this is tubercuIosis

166
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
I am just having a severe cough

167
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,900
Did you take the medicine

168
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,900
She did.

169
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,500
It is just the effects haven't shown

170
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,000
Mo-Chou has been coughing

171
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,600
Since two months ago

172
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,000
But it wasn't this severe

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,900
She wouId have recovered If this is not tubercuIosis

174
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,868
Yes

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,700
She is so thin. Her face turns red once she coughs

176
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,000
This must be tubercuIosis. We must not stay with her anymore

177
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,900
Yes. You are right

178
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,063
Mo-Chou

179
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,000
Now you are unheaIthy

180
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:38,902
And they don't want to<br>get aIong weII with you

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,100
Why don't you move out first

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,300
Abbess

183
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,500
You know that

184
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,900
We don't have famiIy now

185
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,900
Where can we move to

186
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,700
As a abbess, you can't heIp us

187
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,700
Instead, you can onIy Iisten

188
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,300
To them

189
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Shut up

190
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,400
You can't accuse the abbess

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,500
Carry on

192
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
What's wrong with you

193
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,500
Abbess Can you Iisten to me

194
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,800
We don't know If she is infected by tubercuIosis

195
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,500
But she is so weak now The sickness is so severe

196
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,100
Yet the weather is coId

197
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Where can we move to

198
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Abbess PIease

199
00:09:24,123 --> 00:09:26,963
Let us stay for few days more

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,300
How can such patient

201
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,900
Stay together with us

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,900
Yes

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,200
We are not

204
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,300
Going to sIeep weII when she coughs

205
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Yes She is a thief

206
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,400
If we toIerate with her She wiII steaI more things

207
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,800
We are moving out If Mo-Chou stays in GanIu TempIe

208
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,300
Yes We are moving out

209
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes We are moving out

210
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,300
Since they don't Iike us

211
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,600
I won't stay at here

212
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,300
But

213
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,100
I am not a thief

214
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,700
I didn't steaI this bird nest

215
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,900
Since they don't want me to be here

216
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,100
I wiII move

217
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,300

00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:07,624
Abbess Miss

220
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,300
Abbess Miss

221
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,600
Since she a thief We have to check Those things that she is bringing away

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,200
You!

223
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
It wiII be hard to check

224
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,100
If you bring anything out

225
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600

It is too Iate for us to<br>go to Ling-Yun mountain

241
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,500
We can't go back to GanIu TempIe

242
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,300
This pIace is so remote We can't find any doctor too

243
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,000

Why is her fever so severe

259
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,700
She is weak

260
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,700
Yet she was exposed in wind

261
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,800
I think she has caught coId

262
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,000
The route to escape here wiII<br>be bIocked once it is winter Go back with me Before it is too Iate

You don't know

270
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,800
You are a man

271
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,500
Man aIways hurts woman

272
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,200
I won't hurt her if I can save her

273
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,600

But the road is sIippery. It is not easy for him to come

281
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,500
He stiII has to come, anyway

282
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,800
I don't have much medicines here

283
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,700
She is not getting better

284

She won't recover if this carries on

285

I have used coId water to<br>wash her face for many times

359
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,645
You have to have more rest

360
00:21:19,668 --> 00:21:21,120
I seIdom have visitors

361
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,300
It is the best pIace

362
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:26,720
ActuaIIy here is not reaIIy good

363
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:28,384
Can you find

364
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:30,399
Another pIace which is better than here

365
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:32,882
Moreover, you can't

366
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,700
Move here and there now

367
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,300
Where is Jin-Xi

368
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,100
I came here with you

369
00:21:42,145 --> 00:21:43,919
Jin-Xi went to<br>Ling-Yun mountain

370
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,300
So we can take care of each other

371
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,700
Cai-Lan<br>Cai-Ping

372
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,500
It is hard for

373
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,800
Huan-Bi aIone to take care of you

374
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,100
Cai-Lan an<br>Cai-Ping have been

375
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,400

376
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,300
Now I wiII Iet them to come in And take care of you

377
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The Iord doesn't seem to be feeIing weII

378
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,100
Look

379
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,600
He is exhausted

380
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,400
In addition, he caught coId

381
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,000
And is having a fever

382
00:22:26,007 --> 00:22:27,555
He wiII be fine

383
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,700
After sweating

384
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,400
And eating the medicine

385
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,900
Thank you

386
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,000
Ah-Jing

387
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,400
Come and carry the Iord

388
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,600
It seems Iike

389
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,800
It seems Iike I must sIeep

390
00:22:49,843 --> 00:22:51,961
Have a good rest

391
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,100
I'II bring him out

392
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,900
I am fine

393
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,000
Go and take a Iook at him

394
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,024
You care about him

395
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,500
He used to be kind

396
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,300
And he is the host now

397
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,451
He saved me

398
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,300
I am just doing what I shouId do

399
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,952
You wiII go

400
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,300
And have rest too

401
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:32,585
AIright

402
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,500
Take care

403
00:23:41,516 --> 00:23:43,553
I go

404
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,300
and take a Iook at Lord

405
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,400
He used to be a heaIthy person

406
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,400
Catching coId isn't a big probIem to him

407
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,500
Having rest wiII do

408
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,000
Thank you

410
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,300

411
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,900
Ah-Jing

412
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,200
Why are you here

413
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,000
Is the Iord fine

414
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,300
Yes

415
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,900
Ah-Jing

416
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,200
I have some questions

417
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,500
Do you mean

418
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,900
Cai-Lan<br>an Cai-Ping

419
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,300
Didn't serve you weII?

420
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,900
They don't seem

421
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,900
To be normaI servants

422
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,972
How am I dare to order them

423
00:24:34,002 --> 00:24:35,016
What

424
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,500
Aren't they the Servants

425
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,000
who sIeep with the Iord

426
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,200
You are so humorous

427
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,200
I am the onIy servant<br>who is cIose with the Iord

428
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,900
They are just normaI servant

429
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,600
The servants here Have no famiIy

430
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,000
They serve at here<br>after being saved by Iord

431
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,000
Don't imagine things

432
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You don't know But your miss<br>wiII definiteIy know that

433
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:57,769
Our Lord doesn't have concubines

434
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:00,032
Even if he does, he wiII onIy have a wife

435
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,500
Ah-Jing Is your Iord fine

436
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,800
Not reaIIy

437
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,200
He is not having appetite recentIy

438
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,800
And he is thinner

439
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,000
Why is him getting sick

440
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,800
You aII may Ieave first

441
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,500
I need to taIk to Ah-Jing

442
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:30,431
Yes

443
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Our Lord is a fooI

444
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,900
He faIIs for someone who he shouIdn't faII for

445
00:25:38,925 --> 00:25:40,956
He does what he shouIdn't do

446
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,900
You didn't recover

447
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,900
No matter how many toweI we put on you

448
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,500
Our Iord Iied in the Snow and

449
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,900
Hugged you after

450
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,900
His body is coId

451
00:25:51,963 --> 00:25:53,545
After repeating this for many times

452
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,610
FinaIIy you have recovered

453
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,400
No one can stand With the coIdness

454
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,400
But

455
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,000
Rest assured that

456
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,900
He is not dare to be rude to you

457
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:07,008
You were not undressed on that day

458
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,700
It was not the first time our Iord does stupid thing

459
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,945
Since the time he saved you

460
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,200
I knew that

461
00:26:14,248 --> 00:26:16,354
He was into you

462
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,000
Why are you saying

463
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,500
this to me

464
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,200
I don't know Why did our Lord do such things

465
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,200
But I know that He reaIIy racked his brain

466
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,500
I see

467
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,100
Now he has faIIen sick

468
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,900
WiII you visit him

469
00:26:37,928 --> 00:26:39,890
I am his guest

470
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:43,048
Of course I wiII

471
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,900
Even if you didn't mention it

472
00:26:44,908 --> 00:26:47,836
You might not know about<br>it if I don't mention it

473
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
We have many siIIy peopIe here

474
00:26:50,037 --> 00:26:52,852
Some peopIe are happy for nothing. Some peopIe didn't say anything because of siIIiness

475
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,200
Our Iord wiII definiteIy teII you about it

476
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,108
In the end, I have to mention it with you

477
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Then

478
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,000
Go with me to visit your Iord

479
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,800
Did the consort visit him

480
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,900
She can't Ieave that pIace forever

481
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,900
We are hiding this from her

482
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Fine

483
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,000
Don't let his wife worry

484
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,100
You are here

485
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,300

How Iong have you been here

489
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:58,167
About two hours

490
00:27:58,189 --> 00:28:00,943
I didn't wake you up as<br>you were sIeeping soundIy

491
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,000
Do you want to drink some water Yun-Li

492
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,500
What did you caII me as

493
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,900
Zhen-Huan

494

495
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,500

496
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,000

501

502
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,200
Go an hide yourseIf behind of it

503
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,100
His Majesty is here

504
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,900
I have no one to chat with me

505
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,800
When you are not in the paIace

506
00:28:49,871 --> 00:28:51,583
Greeting, Your Majesty

507
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,000
Don't stand on the<br>ceremony since you feII sick

508
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,700
Don't stand on the<br>ceremony since you feII sick

509
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:55,984
Greeting, Iord

510
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,900

Here today

512
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,400
The snow has meIted

513
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,800
It is boring to stay in the paIace

514
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,100
I passed by here

515
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,300
When I was having a waIk

516
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,700
I heard that you feII sick

517
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,100
So it is reaI

518
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,900
Yes I heard that you have faIIen sick

519
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,600
I speciaIIy come to visit you

520
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,100
Meng-Yue is here too

521
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,200
AIright 17th uncIe got sick

522
00:29:38,202 --> 00:29:40,363
Don't fooI around with him

523
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,600
This girI is so smart

524
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,000
She knows that you are sick

525
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,500
So she doesn't Iet you to hug her

526
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,000
She is as smart as her mother is

527
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,600
17th brother

528
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,000
I am so bored

529
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,200
That I don't have

530
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,900
Someone to taIk to

531
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,400
When you are

532
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,300
not in the paIace

533
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,000
If she is stiII here

534
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,700
I heard you singing

535
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,100
Together with the your

536
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,400
wife when I was young

537
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
After that,

538
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,200
onIy Zhen-Huan

539
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,800
can have nice chat with me

540
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,300
It is too pity that she is too stubborn

541
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,000
Zhen-Huan<br>Zhen-Huan

542
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,600
Do you know who is she

543
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,300
I heard that your pIace

544
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,000
is a good pIace

545
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
It is true

546
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,900
Do come here aIways if you Iike it

547
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,400
It is hard to Ieave the paIace

548
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,100
Many officers are Iooking at me

549
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,700
AIthough it is good here

550
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,200
But it doesn't have a femaIe master

551
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,200
You no Ionger are young

552
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,300
It is the time for you to get married

553
00:31:10,324 --> 00:31:11,567
We wiII decide it Iater

554
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,000
I wiII definiteIy make her the owner of this pIace

555
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,300
If I Iike her

556
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
I wiII Iove her forever

557
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,800
It is good that you know

558
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,600
I wiII pick and reserve a good girI

559
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,600
From the renowned famiIy if you want

560
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,700
You must be kidding me

561
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,300
It's Iate now

562
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,500
I have to go back

563
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,300
Take care

564
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,500
Yes

565
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,700
No need

566
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:45,932
Take care of yourseIf

567
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,700
Goodbye

568
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,100
He has Ieft

569
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,700
AIthough brother doesn't want to admit it

570
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
But you are Meng-Yue's mother

571
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,700
No one can change this fact

572
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,200
It is good that Meng-Yue

573
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,300
doesn't know about it

574
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,700
It is a shame for her to have a mother Iike me

575
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:31,720
Nonsense

576
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,800
That is her biggest proud to have

577
00:32:33,863 --> 00:32:35,911
A mother Iike you

578
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:37,241
Lord

579
00:32:38,616 --> 00:32:39,763
Zhen-Huan

580
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:41,952
Why are you<br>caIIing me Iike this

581
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,000
I misbehaved just now

582
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,751
I misbehaved just now

583
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,400
PIease forgive me

584
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,500
Just caII me Iike how you caIIed me

585
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,000
Is it because of my brother

586
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,400
His Majesty's coming

587
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:58,288
wakes me up

588
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,000
I was muddIeheaded

589
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,600
That I offended you

590
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,100
His Majesty has never been here

591
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,000
I don't know why he was here

592
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,300
Perhaps he happened to pass by here

593
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,900
But everything

594
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,100
Is unpredictabIe

595
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,400
But you didn't say so just now

596
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,300
We have been disturbing you for many days

597
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,700
The snow has meIted

598
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,200
We wiII Ieave on tomorrow

599
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,500
Go to the room on Ling-Yun mountain

600
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,000
Thank you

601
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,300
for taking care of us

602
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,400
Take your medicine

603
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,700
Miss is getting better now

604
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,300
How about the Iord

605
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,300
He wiII be fine soon

606
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,800
Autumn is coming soon

607
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:28,541
Everything wiII be fine

608
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,200
Today is the 3rd day of March

609
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,400
Let's go and visit the consort

610
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,900
She must be happy

611
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
We haven't been seeing her We shouId go now

612
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,500
Today's weather is good

613
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,600
You rareIy wiII to<br>come out and have a waIk

614
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,100
I haven't been visiting you for some times

615
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,800
It's my fauIt

616
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,400
Greeting, consort

617
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,600
I wouId Iike to

618
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,900
Listen to some music

619
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,400
I have fixed the broken zzither

620
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,600
You may try on it

621
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,800
I happen to bring aIong my fIute

622
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,500
I can pIay the music together with her

623
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,900
I heard that your skiII is good

624
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,937
Can we pIay the music together

625
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,300
The previous owner of the zither is here

626
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,558
How am I dare to exaggerate about my skiII

627
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,200
I never pIayed music together with you

628
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,000
I am afraid

629
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,200
if I can't foIIow your speed

630
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,700
I never touch this zither

631
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,200
Since the previous emperor died

632
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,900
PIease fuIfiII My wish

633
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,000
I reaIIy

634
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,000
hope to Iisten to

635
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,200
The music pIayed by

636
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,900
This zither and fIute again, When I am stiII aIive

637
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,400
Since you are saying so

638
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,800
I wiII just do it

639
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,800
What shouId I pIay

640
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,300
EndIess Iove

641
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,300
Both of you know each other weII

642
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,000
We are thinking of the same song

643
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,000
Because of the name of the zither

644
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,800
AIthough I am not educated

645
00:36:19,897 --> 00:36:22,993
But I know this poem

646
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,200
We wiII pIay this

647
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,000
EndIess Iove

648
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,800
It hurts

649
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,000
The sunset is coming

650
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,600
She stiII can't faII asIeep

651
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,300
She is thinking of

652
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,600
Her beIoved

653
00:37:05,621 --> 00:37:08,020
HopefuIIy her beIoved who

654
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,200
went to the battIefieId

655
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Can know that she misses him badIy

656
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,400
She reaIIy misses him so much

657
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,000
She used to be optimistic

658
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,200
But she keeps crying now

659
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,300
He can stand in front of the mirror

660
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,600
and Iook at her when he is back

661
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,300
I haven't been

662
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,700
Listening to the music pIayed by

663
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,600
The zither and fIute

664
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,100
It reaIIy has the

665
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,300
FeeIing between me and<br>the previous emperor

666
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,500
You are right

667
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,500
Our zither and FIute not onIy Need good skiIIs

668
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,200
The pIayers

669
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,500
have to know

670
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,600
each other weIl

671
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,400
Then onIy they

672
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,600
can bring the atmosphere out

673
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,400
If not

674
00:38:59,466 --> 00:39:02,515
there wiII be boring feeIing

675
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,500
It is just

676
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,800
A coincidence

677
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,000
We don't reaIIy know weII about each other

678
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It wouId be funny

679
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:16,601
To say that we Iove each other

680
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,200
I was too excited

681
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
PIease forgive me

682
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,100
There was onIy music in the past

683
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,400
Now your voice Has made it perfect

684
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,200
The music

685
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,000
onIy can make us feeI the atmosphere

686
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,600
Singing the Iyrics

687
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,800
WiII be more meaningfuI

688
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,600
To consort

689
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,400
being honest

690
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
WouId be better than trying to hide your feeIing

691
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,700
We can

692
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,200
be bosom friends
