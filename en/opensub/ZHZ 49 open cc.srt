00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Episode 49

2
00:00:04,217 --> 00:00:05,709
You aIways bring aIong your

3
00:00:05,782 --> 00:00:07,842
fIute along with you?

4
00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:09,994
I onIy carry it aIong<br>with me when I come here.

5
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:12,565
My prince is reaIIy fiIiaI to the Iady.

6
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:16,099
I'm here to Iook for you.

7
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:22,774
You must be joking.

8
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,505
Huan, I'm serious towards you.

9
00:00:27,513 --> 00:00:31,102
But I can just assume that you're joking.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,100
Before, you were His Majesty's

11
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:37,289
Iady, but now you're free woman.

12
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:41,468
That's why I'm teIIing you

13
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:44,637
that I'm not joking with you.

14
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:47,230
That's why I'm teIIing you

15
00:00:47,817 --> 00:00:50,205
that I'm not joking with you.

16
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:52,174
I hoId on to myseIf not to find you

17
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:54,657
after you Ieft the CooIing PIatform.

18
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,404
I'm worry that you may be sad or hurt.

19
00:01:00,386 --> 00:01:03,048
But do you know how sad I feeI?

20
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:08,913
I feel really sad for not being abIe to meet you.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,300
I don't know whether you<br>feeI the same with me.

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,600
But this is one of the hardest<br>springs that I've ever been through.

23
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,697
Before, I was a concubine in His Majesty's palace

24
00:01:21,703 --> 00:01:24,367
Now I'm a nun in this tempIe, I don't

25
00:01:24,554 --> 00:01:26,516
have any reIationships with the paIace.

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,400
I've feeIing as weII.

27
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,400
I understand your feeIings.

28
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:36,086
It's just that I reaIIy don't wish to have any

29
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:39,141
reIationship with anyone

30
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,600
of the royaI family anymore.

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,700
You don't accept me is because I'm

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,500
royaIty and you're my brother's consort.

33
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:48,179
But have you really been happy

34
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,818
during the days in the paIace?

35
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:53,679
Have you been truIy happy

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,900
every time I meet you?

37
00:01:56,137 --> 00:01:57,853
No, you even have to hoId

38
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,298
on to yourseIf from crying.

39
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,979
Even though the days in the paIace don't exist

40
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:09,031
now everything is different from the past.

41
00:02:09,907 --> 00:02:11,489
You're a free person now

42
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,100
after you Ieft the paIace.

43
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:16,197
You can be together with anyone you Iike.

44
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,261
Just now you said,

45
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:21,800
everybody has feeIings.

46
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,300
Do you like me, even just a bit?

47
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:27,310
Do you Iike me

48
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,506
even for a IittIe bit?

49
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:33,185
Just Iike that day

50
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,202
when you shouted my name.

51
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,400
Have you been in Iove with a woman before?

52
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:43,170
No.

53
00:02:43,745 --> 00:02:47,155
But I've faIIen in Iove with someone<br>before, that's why I understand.

54
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,100
Don't try to forcefully make a difference

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,300
in hopes for a better ending which won't happen happen.

56
00:02:57,448 --> 00:02:59,960
Just Iike me and His Majesty.

57
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:04,048
If I had treated him Iike the normaI consorts treat him.

58
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,900
In the hope to gain weaIth and gIory without any invoIvement of true Iove.

59
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:11,953
Then, I wouIdn't have been the person who caused my father's downfaII.

60
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:16,548
You've aIready given up hope on romance

61
00:03:16,594 --> 00:03:19,041
after failing the first time?

62
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,100
I would rather that I had never met him

63
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:25,254
if I knew it wouIdn't have

64
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:27,031
turned out to be good.

65
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:31,725
Now,

66
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:34,928
you don't want to

67
00:03:35,784 --> 00:03:38,850
accept a person even if

68
00:03:39,822 --> 00:03:41,389
he can protect and Iove<br>you with aII his heart?

69
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,596
I'm just a smaII IittIe girI,

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,900
I don't have such an honour.

71
00:03:50,124 --> 00:03:51,633
Everything that has passed

72
00:03:52,717 --> 00:03:55,479
is just a dream

73
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:58,208
and the future is cIear, hence there's

74
00:03:59,952 --> 00:04:04,164
no need to be dreaming anymore.

75
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:06,382
You toId me that

76
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,400
you don't Iike the Iady from the Country

77
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:14,135
of Pei even though she is eIegant and nice.

78
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,557
Then, I'm the the same too.

79
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,392
AIthough you're royalty,<br>I just don't Iike you.

80
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,600
Why does my Iady feeI sad ever since

81
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,500
your return from CooIing PIatform?

82
00:04:52,997 --> 00:04:54,134
Nothing.

83
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,450
But my Iady has been quiet for such a Iong time

84
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:05,200
My Iady would be more bored

85
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,900
if Doctor Wen didn't send these birds here.

86
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:33,120
Why there are so noisy?

87
00:05:36,543 --> 00:05:37,514
What is it?

88
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:39,901
It's a cat.

89
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:43,215
Jin-Xi, quickIy chase the cat away.

90
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:45,261
My Iady is scared of cats.

91
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:05,215
My Iady.

92
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,294
It's aIright, Huan.

93
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,200
I've chases away the cat.

94
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:15,532
Sir,

95
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,253
What is that cat? Why is it so big?

96
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,100
It's a wiId cat.

97
00:06:30,843 --> 00:06:32,760
How can anyone keep birds here?

98
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,400
AIthough there are no huge beasts<br>here, there are a Iot of wiId cats.<br>They Iike to eat birds.

99
00:06:38,152 --> 00:06:40,192
LuckiIy no one is hurt.

100
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:42,140
It's aII Doctor Wen's fauIt.

101
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:44,062
He took some birds to make my Iady happy but

102
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:47,330
at the end it Iures the wiId cats over here.

103
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:50,650
Thank you, sir.

104
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:54,736
We don't know what we wouId do if you're not around.

105
00:06:55,534 --> 00:06:56,874
It reaIIy scares me.

106
00:06:57,827 --> 00:06:59,490
I've never seen such a huge cat.

107
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,000
It's aII because of<br>Doctor Wen's negligence.

108
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:06,617
Thank you, sir.

109
00:07:07,754 --> 00:07:09,279
But why are you stiII

110
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,589
here in these Iate hours?

111
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:16,231
You've been sIeeping Iate recently,

112
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:18,866
that's why you Iook so tired.

113
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:19,774
You're here.

114
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,979
I just wait for you to sIeep.

115
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,510
But why are you here

116
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:27,496
after I've sIept today?

117
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:29,472
Huan,

118
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:32,618
You just assume that

119
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,700
I'm Iooking at the moon.

120
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,900
It's my fauIt,

121
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:45,843
I faII asIeep suddenIy and cause you some troubIe.

122
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:47,281
You are an eIegant Iady,

123
00:07:47,942 --> 00:07:50,355
why do you want to torture yourseIf Iike this?

124
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,832
I'II onIy feeI easy after<br>I see Iights in your room

125
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:57,333
It's very Iate now,

126
00:07:57,929 --> 00:07:59,386
you better sIeep now.

127
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,351
You can sIeep soundIy,

128
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:02,143
I. . .

129
00:08:04,912 --> 00:08:05,792
I bid you fareweII.

130
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:34,613
My Iady, His Majesty went to<br>Lady Qi's pIace again yesterday.

131
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:40,064
Lady Qi has a strong background and

132
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:42,047
Her Majesty aIso Iooks up at her. Of course she'II get more attention.

133
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,315
But Lady Qi aIways Iikes to

134
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,700
say something hurtful to you

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,400
She Iooks down at me because of <br>the power of her famiIy.

136
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:53,684
But Iove and position in the court

137
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,132
are never decided by famiIy status.

138
00:08:56,143 --> 00:09:00,831
That's right.<br>I can stiII see that His Majesty<br>stiII has feeIings towards you.

139
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,200
So what?<br>The most important thing is<br>to get His Majesty's attention.

140
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,700
The perfume is finished, has my<br>father asked someone to send it to me?

141
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:18,834
I've passed out the order.<br>I think it'II arrive soon.

142
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:20,416
Good.

143
00:09:20,988 --> 00:09:23,845
UnfortunateIy, I stiII don't have a chiId.

144
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,900
Her Majesty doesn't Iike<br>us to have chiIdren.<br>I sided with Her Majesty,

145
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:31,848
so there's nothing<br>I can do besides <br>foIIow her orders.

146
00:09:31,894 --> 00:09:33,353
Yes.

147
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:35,565
Ju-Qing is not

148
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:38,150
one of your servant.

149
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,900
Don't Iet her stay if you've no use of her.

150
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:44,751
My Iady, His Majesty has just<br>finished his daiIy meeting.

151
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:47,474
Why don't I accompany<br>you to greet him there?

152
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:48,581
No.

153
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:52,282
His Majesty is busy deaIing with<br>Longkodo's matter these few days.

154
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,500
It'II be best if I don't disturb him.

155
00:09:58,677 --> 00:10:00,965
Good morning, mother.

156
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:02,766
Sit.

157
00:10:09,863 --> 00:10:13,079
It's been sometime since my Iast visit here.

158
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:15,852
PIease forgive me.

159
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:20,400
His Majesty shouId aIways<br>take care the government.

160
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,900
ActuaIIy there is onIy<br>one important matter.

161
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:32,948
Longkodo has created his own<br>circIe of power and betrayed me.

162
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:37,617
His Majesty reaIIy wants to get<br>rid of Longkodo after Nian Gengyao.

163
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:40,457
I thought Longkodo could die

164
00:10:40,497 --> 00:10:44,945
in peace for his remaining days.

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,400
So, Your Majetsy is stiII<br>unabIe to accept him.

166
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,100
It's not that I can't accept Longkodo.<br>It's just that he is the one<br>who can't accept himseIf.

167
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,100
He and Nian Gengyao have built<br>their own circIes of power.

168
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:02,414
You shouId know that Nian Gengyao<br>can't come aIong weII with Longkodo.

169
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,800
In order to maintain caIm<br>and order between them.

170
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Your Majesty suggests<br>to grant Nian Gengyao's<br>eIdest son to be Longkodo's step son.

171
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:18,531
You're the chief<br>instigator for their pIot.

172
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:20,497
Longkodo has committed a Iot of crimes.

173
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:24,838
It won't be too bad if I bIame<br>him for one or two of the crimes.

174
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:28,325
Besides he has committed many crimes.

175
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:33,594
He can't argue even if he stand<br>in front of the Court of Yama.

176
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:35,882
PreviousIy, you've heIped me

177
00:11:36,886 --> 00:11:39,856
to pIan to kiII Nian Gengyao.

178
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:42,948
But why today you keep

179
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,539
on protecting Longkodo?

180
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Is your friendship with him<br>reaIIy that strong?

181
00:11:54,354 --> 00:11:56,984
I've toId you earIier,

182
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,900
Nian Gengyao and Longkodo<br>are the ones who put<br>your father on the throne.

183
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,000
You can only kiII one of them, now that <br> Nian Gengyao is not here,<br>you can't kiII Longkodo.

184
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:10,569
If you do, the future generations

185
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:13,660
wiII accuse you for not being gratefuI.

186
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,536
I'm just advising you for the

187
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:21,476
sake of your own reputation.

188
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,511
I can spare anyone

189
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,519
but not Longkodo.

190
00:12:28,608 --> 00:12:31,762
Longkodo is the brother of Empress Xiaoyiren,

191
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:33,781
technicaIIy he is your uncIe.

192
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,000
Even though you don't<br>care about Longkodo but

193
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:40,365
at least you can have some<br>respect for Empress Xiaoyiren.

194
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:43,704
I do this is not onIy for me,

195
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,900
but to protect your reputation as weII.

196
00:12:49,253 --> 00:12:52,877
Longkodo is your chiIdhood friend.

197
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,530
Father may not know about this

198
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,700
but it doesn't mean that I don't know.

199
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,000
When is the 3rd of March for Shangsi FestivaI?

200
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:09,156
You shouId know better than me that you are not

201
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:13,582
onIy protecting father's face but my face too.

202
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:16,593
If you're not wiIIing

203
00:13:16,593 --> 00:13:18,367
to Iet go of Longkodo.

204
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,874
Then are you wiIIing to Iet go of my hard-earned

205
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:24,477
throne and your prestigious reputation?

206
00:13:24,477 --> 00:13:27,411
I've built a smaII house at the corner

207
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:36,087
of Chang Chun Garden for Longkodo.

208
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,400
I'II put him under house arrest.

209
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,300
I beg mother to protect my reputation.

210
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:55,500
Stand there, who is it?

211
00:13:57,334 --> 00:14:01,362
I'm Aunty Sun, a servant for the Empress Dowager. I wouId Iike to take a famiIy<br>member of Longkodo to meet him.

212
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:02,770
It won't be Iong.

213
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,894
It's Aunty Sun.<br>I'm sorry for offending you.

214
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:06,928
PIease.

215
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,000
I'II guard here for<br>you, you can enter now.

216
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,154
Who is it?

217
00:14:31,616 --> 00:14:32,765
It's me.

218
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:36,890
Greetings, my Iady.

219
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:39,060
Stand up.

220
00:14:42,763 --> 00:14:45,477
You were smart and proud

221
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
when I first saw you.

222
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,600
But now you're in such a poor state.

223
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:55,116
It's aII my fauIt.

224
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,790
No, it's my fauIt.

225
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:02,184
I'm gIad that Your Highness is stiII

226
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,700
wiIIing to meet me when<br>I'm in such poor condition.

227
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:13,044
I've known you for so many years. <br>It's normaI that I pay you a visit.

228
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,200
This pIace is coId, <br>can your Iegs withstand it?

229
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:22,005
Thank you for your care.

230
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:24,921
My Iegs have been better.

231
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,400
Your Highness, pIease take a seat.

232
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,500
Your Iegs were injured when<br>you tried to save me Iast time.

233
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,400
Of course I have to take care of it.

234
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:42,915
PIease, sit down.

235
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:45,635
Thank you, Your Highness.

236
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,800
I'm honoured to serve under you.

237
00:15:54,355 --> 00:15:58,361
I heard that you keep<br> faIIing iII after you

238
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,808
moved to PaIace of<br>Longevity and Good HeaIth.

239
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:05,272
I don't dare to visit you often<br>even though I'm worried about you. <br>PIease forgive me.

240
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,600
I am taking the piIIs that<br>you've given me aII this time

241
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,500
I'm oId and useIess.

242
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:20,721
Before, I could settIe aII my

243
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:24,635
opponents without any difficuIty.

244
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,100
But now I feeI tired

245
00:16:29,998 --> 00:16:34,544
whenever I think of it.

246
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,400
It's okay, Your Highness,

247
00:16:37,473 --> 00:16:40,724
everything has passed.

248
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,300
At Iast, you've succeed in handIing the<br>opponents and become<br>the Ieader of the court.

249
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:50,713
No matter what it is, I'II aIways<br>remember how you've heIped me before.

250
00:16:50,713 --> 00:16:55,345
I've been promoted from a

251
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:57,822
ranked femaIe officer to

252
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:04,100
Honoured Lady, Consort,<br>and finaIIy Empress Dowager

253
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,600
I'II never forget how you've heIped me.

254
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,400
I don't dare to take any credit.

255
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:19,237
I've never forgotten that<br>day throughout aII these years.

256
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,800
That day, the Shangsi FestivaI.

257
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:29,682
That day you toId me that you've

258
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,000
dealt with aII the officiaIs.

259
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,300
They'd Iet me wear

260
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:37,236
a Iight bIue gown that

261
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,700
day because His Majesty<br>didn't Iike the coIour.

262
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,200
Hence, I would not be seIected and<br>immediately, I'd be married to you.

263
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,500
It was hard to predict, that at the end I had

264
00:17:54,364 --> 00:18:00,771
been chosen to be an<br>officiaI in the court.

265
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,983
You're Iucky and have the<br>bIessing from the Heaven.

266
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:08,120
I'm the one that is unfortunate.

267
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,400
There is no need to say<br>things Iike this again.

268
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:19,115
We're aIready oId.<br>You have a Iot of wives and

269
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,200
concubines whiIe I've<br>become the Empress Dowager.

270
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,200
AII things are predetermined by fate,<br>and nobody can change it.

271
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:34,136
Today, I came here to meet you,<br>and to have a smaII reunion with you

272
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:36,053
Besides that, I aIso want to Iet you know

273
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:40,624
that I'II pIea to His<br>Majesty for his mercy.

274
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:44,198
Thank you, Your Highness.

275
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,800
Stand up.

276
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:54,453
You're an oId friend of mine. I just do what I shouId do for you.

277
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,100
These are your favourite dishes.

278
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,700
I cooked them myseIf .I'm not sure whether it<br>stiII tastes as good as before.

279
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:25,589
It's good to forget<br>everything after we drunk.

280
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:35,454
I'm touched that Her Majesty

281
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,115
wouId personally cook for me.

282
00:19:40,235 --> 00:19:43,910
thank.

283
00:19:47,243 --> 00:19:52,179
You aIways treated me as an Empress in your

284
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,995
heart and forget that<br>I'm your chiIdhood friend.

285
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:01,772
No matter what, I'II never

286
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:09,368
forget you as my chiIdhood friend.

287
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,511
I hope so.

288
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,900
Y'ou... you...

289
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:46,810
First and foremost, I'm the Empress Dowager,

290
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,717
I'm His Majesty's mother.

291
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:52,738
I'm the honour of the entire Uya CIan.

292
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,500
Secondly, I'm a consort for the Iate<br>emperor

293
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,900
and your chiIdhood friend.

294
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:05,227
That time,

295
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:08,504
you toId me that the Iate<br>emperor didn't Iike the Iight bIue coIour.

296
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:12,715
So, you asked me to wear a Iight<br>bIue coIoured gown to the competition.

297
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,700
ActuaIIy, you aIready<br>knew from the start that

298
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,870
Iight bIue was the Iate<br>emperor's favourite coIour.

299
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,500
You wanted me to enter into the<br>paIace and heIp your sister.

300
00:21:31,716 --> 00:21:35,869
You wanted to use me to strengthen<br>Empress Xiaoyiren's position in the court.

301
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:40,742
If Empress Xiaoyiren did not have a<br>chiId then you wouldn't heIp my son either.

302
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,800
You've destroyed my whoIe Iife.

303
00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:48,917
So now,

304
00:21:49,801 --> 00:21:52,458
I want to destroy yours.

305
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,374
My son

306
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:13,778
wiII onIy feeI<br>relief after your die.

307
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:32,992
It's the prince's fIute again.

308
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:35,014
Is it?

309
00:22:37,142 --> 00:22:40,185
OnIy his fIute has this kind of sound.

310
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,400
I don't know when is he going to stop.

311
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:58,434
Miss, is the sound of<br>the fIute stiII here?

312
00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:00,942
Yes.

313
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:07,464
He really is pitiable

314
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:09,934
It's starting to rain,

315
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,900
he'II faII iII Iater.

316
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,000
Miss, let go of the past

317
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,100
You are torturing yourseIf and the prince.

318
00:24:26,141 --> 00:24:31,848
ActuaIIy I reaIIy feeI<br>strongIy in these few days<br>that the prince is reaIIy<br>a person that we can

319
00:24:34,187 --> 00:24:38,633
depend on for the rest of our Iives.<br>Let me be frank, nobody wiII know<br>what wiII happen in the future.

320
00:24:40,473 --> 00:24:44,143
The most important thing<br>is now at this moment.

321
00:24:45,163 --> 00:24:46,909
The most important thing

322
00:24:47,683 --> 00:24:49,264
is now at this moment.

323
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:55,947
Yes, who is going to know<br>what wiII happen in the future.

324
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,500
The most important thing<br>is we get our happiness now.

325
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,300
It's reaIIy unwise, if we sacrifice our

326
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,500
happiness today for the unknown future.

327
00:25:19,661 --> 00:25:21,220
Miss, umbreIIa.

328
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:35,553
Miss, finaIIy she is<br>wiIIing to make a move.

329
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,594
Yes.

330
00:25:37,668 --> 00:25:40,592
She is going to make<br>a move sooner or Iater.

331
00:25:40,592 --> 00:25:45,581
Just that she'II get her happiness earIier<br>if she makes her move a bit earIier.

332
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:24,473
Huan, is that you?

333
00:26:26,024 --> 00:26:27,068
It's me, I'm here.

334
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,500
Why do you come here when it's raining?

335
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,600
You may get sick Iater.

336
00:26:38,643 --> 00:26:41,097
You're the one that doesn't<br>take care of theirself

337
00:26:41,156 --> 00:26:44,749
You play the<br>fIute, even when it's raining.

338
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:48,159
I know you're scared of the thunder.

339
00:26:48,963 --> 00:26:52,485
I won't be scared with you beside me.

340
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:55,498
What did you say? Say it again.

341
00:26:56,349 --> 00:27:00,605
I won't be scared with you beside me.

342
00:27:07,812 --> 00:27:10,895
Huan, since when did you

343
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,002
have feeIings towards me?

344
00:27:15,026 --> 00:27:16,884
Maybe during the time

345
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:20,166
in the CooIing PIatform.

346
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:23,385
Maybe it's beside the Iong river.

347
00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:26,740
Maybe earIier.

348
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:29,105
But you're there for me<br>whenever I need you.

349
00:27:30,894 --> 00:27:34,056
Do you know that,

350
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:37,162
I'II never know what do you think<br>of me if you never teII these to me.

351
00:27:37,358 --> 00:27:40,892
You're Iike a soIid jade.

352
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,500
You're the most handsome<br>man that I've ever seen

353
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,600
You're Iike this in my heart.

354
00:27:50,561 --> 00:27:53,755
Huan, you're my everything in my heart.

355
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,400
Everything is empty without you beside me.

356
00:27:58,699 --> 00:28:02,163
You make everything that

357
00:28:02,824 --> 00:28:05,327
I've Iost worthwhiIe.

358
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,900
You make everything that

359
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,600
I've Iost worthwhiIe

360
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:24,100
I'm the daughter of a traitor and a divorcée, abandoned at a Buddhist monastary, and I've given birth to a daughter

361
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,900
While you have aII the beaufituI Iadies for you to choose from.

362
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,700
There's reaIIy not need for you to<br>be together with a Iousy person Iike me.

363
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:35,068
Huan, you have to beIieve that to me,

364
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,800
you are the best person in my heart.

365
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,400
They caIIed this <br>the "Inseparable Hands".

366
00:28:50,444 --> 00:28:54,407
Partners that hoId hands<br>Iike this will never be apart.

367
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,400
Huan, I wish that I'm not dreaming. I wish we wiII never be apart.

368
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:01,819
I think I'm dreaming.<br>PIease don't wake me up.

369
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:07,914
This is not a dream.

370
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,900
These are the days that we'II<br>have for the rest of our Iife.

371
00:29:16,978 --> 00:29:20,140
Huan, do you know how happy I

372
00:29:20,988 --> 00:29:23,535
am now that you've finally accepted me?

373
00:29:24,046 --> 00:29:26,811
I reaIIy wish to teII

374
00:29:26,969 --> 00:29:28,598
my mother that I've got

375
00:29:28,598 --> 00:29:31,406
the person that I wanted

376
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,600
the most in the worId.

377
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,400
What a coincidence? The prince<br>has come together with my Iady.

378
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,500
Where is my mother?

379
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,100
Empress Dowager has just finished<br>chanting, she is enjoying her tea.

380
00:30:13,037 --> 00:30:15,127
Mother, mother.

381
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:16,046
Yun-Li,

382
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,100
Let's greet my mother.

383
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,277
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

384
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:25,023
Greetings, mother.

385
00:30:25,705 --> 00:30:27,969
What's going on today?

386
00:30:28,469 --> 00:30:30,443
Why are you both acting so formal today?

387
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,861
Come.

388
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:39,140
At Iast both of you are together.

389
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,800
Thank you, my Iady.

390
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,400
My Iady aIready knew that I'd be<br>together with him from the start?

391
00:30:49,953 --> 00:30:52,059
I didn't say anything.

392
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,804
Yun-Li reaIIy didn't teII me anything.

393
00:30:57,268 --> 00:31:00,529
I know it since both of you partnered

394
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,088
together to perform the music that day

395
00:31:06,236 --> 00:31:12,442
OnIy Iovers can match so weII together.

396
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,762
Come, my chiId.

397
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:23,244
I just had a short<br>gIimpse of thought that day,

398
00:31:23,783 --> 00:31:27,744
I never thought you<br>have such a fate with me.

399
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,200
Come, sit down, quickIy.

400
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:38,901
My chiId, you shouId have told me earIier.<br>You shouIdn't keep this from me.

401
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:42,501
This matter has been<br>through a huge turning point.

402
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:46,198
Now it's just starting to settIe down.

403
00:31:48,695 --> 00:31:50,909
That's why I brought her here to meet you so quickly.

404
00:31:51,074 --> 00:31:53,222
Huan, I brought you here

405
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,766
to meet my mother, so as to

406
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:00,593
prove to you that I'm serious about this reIationship.

407
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,800
Yun-Li has said it Iike this,

408
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,700
it's obvious that he is serious towards you.

409
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,200
I feel glad that you have <br>both finally gotten together

410
00:32:17,955 --> 00:32:20,416
I'm just worried now,

411
00:32:21,555 --> 00:32:23,805
that my Iady may not accept me.

412
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,900
I know what are you worrying about.

413
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,300
But let the past be the past.

414
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I've never heard of a divorced <br> consort returning to the palace

415
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:41,827
Since then why not we thought<br>of a way to Iive a better Iife?

416
00:32:43,224 --> 00:32:48,834
There aren't many days that we <br> can have such happy moments in our lives

417
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,200
Today is a really great day

418
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:58,880
Finally, the two of you can be together

419
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,712
It has been hard for the two of you

420
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,117
to get together

421
00:33:08,117 --> 00:33:10,115
Both of you shouId appreciate it.

422
00:33:10,712 --> 00:33:14,028
I'II remember your advice.

423
00:33:19,674 --> 00:33:23,054
Your Majesty, pIease drink some herbal tea.

424
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,500
How is the Empress Dowager?

425
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:28,309
Her condition is stiII bad.

426
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,500
Doctor said she has too many<br>things that she keeps to herseIf.

427
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:35,600
Your Majesty, do you<br>want to pay a visit there?

428
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,500
The empress is just being upset.

429
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,400
What can I do if even the doctor<br>can't do anything about it.

430
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,788
Your Majesty, it's been Iong time since<br>you've visited Empress Dowager

431
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:51,600
Maybe she'II feeI better<br>after you pay a visit to her.

432
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,500
I never thought that she'd be so sick.

433
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,100
She is sick because of me.

434
00:33:58,298 --> 00:34:01,140
Maybe she hates me.

435
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,500
What is the use of me for going there?

436
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,900
Enough.

437
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:11,879
Go to the HaII of ProIonged<br>Happiness, I want to visit Lady An.

438
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:13,319
Yes.

439
00:34:25,685 --> 00:34:27,114
My chiId,

440
00:34:28,043 --> 00:34:33,011
you take care<br>of me whenever I'm sick.

441
00:34:33,683 --> 00:34:36,735
It's my honour to serve you.

442
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,373
Not even His Majesty is as fiIiaI as you.

443
00:34:42,328 --> 00:34:44,967
Where is His Majesty?

444
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,100
Say it.

445
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,000
His Majesty is deaIing with the death of

446
00:34:56,258 --> 00:34:57,655
Longkodo at the HaII<br>of MentaI CuItivation.

447
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,900
Good, good.

448
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:09,452
His Majesty wants to be a good emperor.

449
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,700
I shouId be happy about it.

450
00:35:16,082 --> 00:35:18,439
So I shouldn't blame him for not visiting me <br> Perhaps I should not be so sick

451
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:21,996
Empress Dowager, why do<br>you say such a sad thing?

452
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,600
I'm not sad, I'm just

453
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:28,026
happy for His Majesty.

454
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,400
My dear, you're now the

455
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,700
onIy one who's IoyaI to me.

456
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:50,491
Zu-xi, pass out my<br>order to promote Honoured

457
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:54,613
Lady Hui to the position<br>of ImperiaI Concubine.

458
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:57,007
Yes.

459
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,300
I treated you weII not as <br>to wish for a promotion.

460
00:36:01,341 --> 00:36:02,849
I know.

461
00:36:03,677 --> 00:36:06,349
I'm just fuIfiIIing your intention.

462
00:36:07,061 --> 00:36:09,490
His Majesty wiII be accusd as an unfiIiaI

463
00:36:09,755 --> 00:36:14,856
person if you were not here everyday.

464
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,960
Yes.

465
00:36:20,622 --> 00:36:22,322
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

466
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,500
His Majesty feeIs troubIed IateIy.

467
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,400
I know I'm incapable<br>to relieve your burden.

468
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:36,151
I felt happy after you came here

469
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,300
I feIt a sense of usefuIness for<br>being abIe to reIieve your tension.

470
00:36:41,483 --> 00:36:43,892
Don't you Iook down upon yourseIf anymore.

471
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:49,600
You're the most soft and kind consort in<br>the paIace that can make<br>me feeI comfortabIe.

472
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:54,040
I've made a new<br>aroma that can reIax our minds.

473
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,980
I've burnt it.

474
00:36:56,638 --> 00:37:00,394
What do you think?

475
00:37:01,415 --> 00:37:03,641
It's refreshing and sweet,

476
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,300
just Iike you.

477
00:37:36,945 --> 00:37:38,450
Why do you come here earIy in the morning?

478
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:43,200
I saw a bIooming MagnoIia<br>at CooIing PIatform just now.

479
00:37:43,885 --> 00:37:47,205
I picked it just for you. <br>After all, we met during the season of flowers

480
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,600
Have you eaten your breakfast?

481
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,600
I was rushing here to meet you, <br>and forgot about feeling hungry

482
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,900
You're quite good at sweet talking

483
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:03,405
Has anything happened in the palace?

484
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Longkodo has died during his house arrest<br>and Empress Dowager has faIIen iII.

485
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:13,943
His Majesty has kiIIed<br>everybody that heIped him before.

486
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:18,190
He is Iike a nobody for me, when<br>you mention about him just now.

487
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,885
He is nobody.

488
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,600
What a coincidence.<br>I've thought of painting.

489
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,800
Since you've arranged everything,<br>why not Iet me to draw your portrait?

490
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,400
There is no artist Iike you.<br>How can you draw my portrait if you just<br>keep on drawing without even Iook at me.

491
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,500
Come and Iook for yourseIf.

492
00:39:20,474 --> 00:39:21,955
It's nice.

493
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,900
I didn't paint this while looking at you because your appearance is imprinted in my heart.

494
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,500
Sweet taIk again.

495
00:39:32,507 --> 00:39:34,957
Look here

496
00:39:38,188 --> 00:39:40,955
That's more Iike it.

497
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,300
It's your turn.

498
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,500
I can't.

499
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,600
It's ok.

500
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,500
Yun-Li is not an outsider.

501
00:39:58,571 --> 00:39:59,585
Yun-Li.
