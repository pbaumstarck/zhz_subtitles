1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
Episode 50

2
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,200
You told me before, <br> you've gave up on relationship between men and women

3
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:29,800
You also said, <br> you will forget everyone who are related to the palace

4
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:35,167
but what's with Duke Guo? <br> How are you going to explain this?

5
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:36,769
yes

6
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:38,837
I admit I said these before

7
00:00:38,858 --> 00:00:40,767
you promised and why it doesn't count anymore?

8
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:46,655
It's hard to predict changes in this world <br> you can't take 'once' as 'forever'

9
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:53,435
just like how my family once prospered <br> and just like how I was once naive ZhenHuan

10
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:59,908
but those are in the past <br> regardless of whether I don't want it to pass or not

11
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,777
but it still becomes history

12
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:07,770
I don't want to hear you saying these <br> just tell me..

13
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,104
what happened between you and Duke Guo?

14
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:16,036
I like him , and he likes me too

15
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,600
just like this

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,800
ok..

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,900
only now you tell me the truth

18
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,000
but why must it be him?

19
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,900
you want to know why?

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,900
because I have already gave up on relationship

21
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,312
because I'm despaired towards my life

22
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:41,146
its Yun Li

23
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:43,619
He started to give me hope

24
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:46,332
He gave me reason to move on

25
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:51,423
but if you choose to be with him

26
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:54,078
you might have to suffer a lot in the future

27
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:56,155
I have to suffer

28
00:01:56,497 --> 00:01:57,835
so does him

29
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:01,223
Since I'm willing to follow him

30
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,202
it means I have thought about what I might encounter

31
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:08,054
Those hardship and unjust that you were afraid of me enduring..

32
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:12,545
are all out of my will

33
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:21,357
Willingly? <br> What determination

34
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:29,082
but my devotion to you are also out of my will too

35
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:30,683
That's not the same

36
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:33,878
I'm grateful for your kindness

37
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:37,215
but he and I are attracted to each other

38
00:02:39,148 --> 00:02:41,067
Even if choosing Yun Li might be a mistake

39
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:43,945
I rather be wrong till the end

40
00:02:45,186 --> 00:02:46,384
with no regret

41
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,236
frankly speaking

42
00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:53,352
Do you think your will to be with me is more important?

43
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:55,952
or my sincere happiness is more important?

44
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:00,765
To be honest

45
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:02,427
all the while

46
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:05,289
I have been hoping to be with you officially

47
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:09,703
but I knew it even in my dreams that

48
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,144
you don't like me at all

49
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:13,789
You will never be happy sincerely if you were to be with me

50
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:16,984
so

51
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:22,161
you sincere happiness is more important

52
00:03:24,656 --> 00:03:26,964
Thank you, Brother Shi Chu

53
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:31,250
for treating me nicely

54
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:39,272
he gets to have your will

55
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:42,558
you'll never know how envious I am

56
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:47,348
In the future you'll get to meet a girl who is sincere to you

57
00:04:07,743 --> 00:04:10,259
Its obvious that Dr Wen really likes you

58
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:20,099
Master, Dr Wen is here

59
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:21,465
Please come in

60
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,606
You're here

61
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:31,607
you knew that I don't care about those status addressing

62
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:32,924
faster get up

63
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:33,972
Thank you master

64
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:39,695
What happened? You're getting thinner

65
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:42,442
Nothing much

66
00:04:50,783 --> 00:04:52,104
What really happened?

67
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:53,789
Did something happened to Huan er?

68
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:55,571
Huan er is ok

69
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:58,830
it's just that she doesn't need me anymore

70
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,150
Huan er knows what she wants

71
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:05,432
but do you understand what you need most?

72
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:08,919
Its because I truly understand

73
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,111
that I know that I could never get it

74
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:12,950
since you can't get it

75
00:05:12,977 --> 00:05:15,174
then you don't have to be sad for no reason

76
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:17,265
its easy to say

77
00:05:18,147 --> 00:05:19,868
but its hard to do that

78
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:25,265
You're a man

79
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,022
why are you so long-winded?

80
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:30,533
if you like her<br> it doesn't matter whether she likes you or not

81
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:32,828
you just need to be yourself

82
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:34,968
if you don't like her anymore

83
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:36,552
just let it go calmly!

84
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:39,149
why do you have to make yourself so difficult and sallow?

85
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:40,549
you're asking for it for no reason!

86
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,556
I never know that the dignified and discreet Hui Bin Niangniang spoke

87
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:49,625
so intensely

88
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:55,013
That's not intense

89
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:00,236
it's just that advising others and advising ourselves..

90
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:03,572
are the same kind of sayings

91
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:13,748
Looking at this water

92
00:06:15,537 --> 00:06:19,079
I will think of when I met you accidentally <br> in YuanMing Palace

93
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:22,746
I never thought that there'll be today

94
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:24,498
yes

95
00:06:25,204 --> 00:06:27,494
You were really daring that day

96
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:30,659
you dare to go to visit sisters who were grounded

97
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:38,054
Don't know how is Mei Jiejie now

98
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,897
She is very good, just got promoted as Hui Bin

99
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,859
other than visiting Longyue

100
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,402
she still doesn't like to social

101
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,218
Based on her temperament

102
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:53,227
she'll rather grow old lonely in the palace

103
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:55,614
than begging for sympathy from the King

104
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:59,022
It's just that she is still young and beautiful

105
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:01,065
yet have to live a depressed life forever

106
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:03,272
that's too pitiful

107
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:06,729
You think that she's pitful

108
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:08,789
With the Great Empress's protection

109
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,121
despite her being disgraced by the King

110
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,386
no one will ever harm her

111
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:18,579
just like my LongYue

112
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:22,061
she's not as striking as the crown prince

113
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:26,265
I just hope that my LongYue could be safe

114
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:29,539
The King and the Great Empress both love her very much

115
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:32,820
not to mention that LongYue herself is very likable

116
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:34,450
you don't have to worry

117
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:38,270
Everyone has their own good

118
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,631
all you need now is just

119
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:42,789
to love yourself nicely

120
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,320
Yes

121
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:49,338
We have to love ourselves nicely

122
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:53,342
For you, and for those who worried me

123
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:05,745
It is becoming an antique

124
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:08,161
you're still bringing it with you

125
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,297
Even though it is an antique

126
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:12,217
but if I don't have it all these years

127
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,941
I'll never feel so calm

128
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:19,389
Sometimes I thought

129
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:21,912
that all I could leave behind in my life

130
00:08:23,748 --> 00:08:25,388
will only be this small drawings

131
00:08:28,785 --> 00:08:31,587
Actually when I was in the palace <br> I have already see you as my best friend

132
00:08:33,548 --> 00:08:35,477
just that I'm afraid of my heart

133
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:41,578
So are you still afraid now?

134
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,305
As long as you're around

135
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:47,081
I'm not afraid of anything

136
00:08:52,027 --> 00:08:52,901
Your majesty,

137
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,785
people from the House of Affairs has arrived

138
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:57,326
Your majesty, its time to pick the namecard

139
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,511
go to YanXi Palace

140
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:02,900
Your majesty, other than reading reports these few days

141
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:07,619
you have been going to AnPing Niangniang's place only <br> Today... should you change to other mistress's place?

142
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:10,159
You're becoming more daring

143
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:11,782
I'm sorry!

144
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,188
I'm just saying it

145
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:16,905
or Your Majesty, do you want to go to ShouKang Palace to visit the Great Empress?

146
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,229
You have been busy at work recently <br> its been long since you last visited her

147
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:22,506
I will go tomorrow!

148
00:09:25,664 --> 00:09:27,206
Prepare to go to YanXi Palace

149
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:28,628
Roger

150
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:30,798
The Great Empress is ill

151
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:33,464
yet Your Majesty always come to my place

152
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,654
I'm going to be scolded dead soon

153
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,275
What they scolded you for? Tell me

154
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:40,885
Deceptive Vixen

155
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,791
Roots of troubles

156
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:45,219
From my perspective

157
00:09:45,707 --> 00:09:47,545
those are words of praise

158
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,338
Your majesty doesn't feel sorry for me

159
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:52,426
How that I'm not feeling sorry for you?

160
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,584
If Your majesty truly feel sorry for me,

161
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:56,474
just tell me one truth

162
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,153
what?

163
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,099
These days when the Great Empress is ill

164
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:03,611
why Your Majesty doesn't go to visit her?

165
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,173
Is it really because of me?

166
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,384
If so, my sins deserve me to be dead

167
00:10:08,793 --> 00:10:10,883
The reason for the Great Empress's illness ..

168
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:13,165
is of her own acknowledgement

169
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:14,861
Your majesty, don't be angry

170
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,827
Look at you after all these days, <br>busying approving projects in YangXin Palace

171
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:20,075
your face is getting greenish!

172
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:22,233
You must take care of your health

173
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,997
I know it myself

174
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,035
This morning, LongYue came to greet me

175
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,800
I kinda heard that today is some important day

176
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,100
Today is April 17

177
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:44,324
its not really an important day

178
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:46,355
Indeed, its not an important day

179
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:51,647
I kinda remember its someone's birthday

180
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:56,545
Your Majesty, let me treat you to your sleep

181
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:11,614
Come, Yue er

182
00:11:11,663 --> 00:11:13,890
Eat it

183
00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:15,204
You're really obedient

184
00:11:17,373 --> 00:11:20,503
Meimei, whats with you?

185
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,600
Why must you ask me to bring LongYue over?<br>without any reasons

186
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:29,005
JingFei Jiejie, today is Huan Er's birthday

187
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:35,833
HuiPing, this shouldn't be said

188
00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:40,356
I know the King had ruled that nobody should talk about HuanEr

189
00:11:40,897 --> 00:11:42,847
no mention about LongYue's birth mother

190
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:47,252
but Huan Er is still LongYue's birth mother

191
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:52,147
Can't I ask Jiejie to bring LongYue over for me to show my sincerity?

192
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,900
I know you're still missing WanPing

193
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:57,819
but I'm missing her too

194
00:11:59,515 --> 00:12:01,191
I knew it early

195
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:03,811
The King looks like he had let go of WanPin

196
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,160
but he still misses her in her heart

197
00:12:07,358 --> 00:12:09,758
you see, ever since WanPin left the palace

198
00:12:09,782 --> 00:12:12,437
Other than AnPin and QiPin's place,

199
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:17,059
he never visited our palace at all

200
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:20,090
I don't care whether the King visted our place or not

201
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:24,854
I'm only missing HuanEr, <br> don't know if she's living well outside

202
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,895
Ever since last winter, <br>the Great Empress have been sick often

203
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:32,242
Even Aunt FangRu doesn't have time to go out

204
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:34,159
Nothing bad will happened for sure

205
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:38,345
WanPin is blessed <br> no one will bully her again

206
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,111
No worries

207
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,728
Your majesty

208
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:48,246
Your Majesty! What happened to you?

209
00:12:48,874 --> 00:12:49,883
Your Majesty!

210
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:53,274
Eunuch Su! Eunuch Su!

211
00:12:54,915 --> 00:12:57,039
Brat! Something's wrong!

212
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,940
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! <br>What happened to you?

213
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,682
Your Majesty! Your Majesty

214
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,842
What's wrong? What's wrong to the King?

215
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,223
Faster!

216
00:13:03,472 --> 00:13:04,749
The King gets fever suddenly

217
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:06,129
Faster go and call for the doctor!

218
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:06,552
Your Majesty!

219
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,400
Faster go!!

220
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:09,242
Yes! Yes! Doctor!

221
00:13:09,242 --> 00:13:11,022
Summon the doctor! Fast!

222
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,900
BaoQue

223
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,000
Faster pour away the herbs inside

224
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:18,385
The thing inside shouldn't been seen by anyone!

225
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:21,344
Remember! Don't let anyone know!

226
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:23,689
If the content of this incense burner were known

227
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,774
You and I will be dead!

228
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:28,663
Faster go!

229
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,391
Have the King been moved to YangXin Palace?

230
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:39,340
Yes

231
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,600
We have already arranged for the Mistresses and the Dukes to take turn attend upon

232
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,500
Don't allow too many mistresses to stand by

233
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,046
especially those who are seductive

234
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:52,566
Just let the Queen, Qi-Fei, Jing-Fei

235
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,223
and Hui-Pin, that's all

236
00:13:55,223 --> 00:13:55,541
Yes

237
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:59,361
What did the doctor said after treating the King?

238
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,200
The Doctor said

239
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:03,201
The King's pulse condition is weak, he's been overworked too much

240
00:14:04,065 --> 00:14:06,617
Where have the King been recently?

241
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:09,761
Other than meeting the ministers he have been approving reports only

242
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:14,525
but don't know why, he's been unhappy these few days

243
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:17,300
Who have been serving his sleep?

244
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:20,800
Its usually An-Pin Niangniang, or Qi-Pin

245
00:14:20,863 --> 00:14:23,464
but the days he got served during sleep weren't much

246
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,800
If your Majesty doesn't believe, you could check for the record by House of Affairs

247
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,700
This happened in YanXi Palace, there must be something to do with An-Pin

248
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,400
But why is His Majesty unhappy recently?

249
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,329
Especially these few days

250
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,011
What was yesterday's date?

251
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:48,382
Yesterday was April 17

252
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:50,413
Is there anything wrong?

253
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:55,260
Yesterday was the abandoned imperial concubine - <br>Wan-Pin's birthday

254
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,700
Then, it's not An-Pin's fault

255
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:07,509
I thought he has already let that go

256
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,124
So that's how it is

257
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:12,611
Su Pei Sheng!

258
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,508
Yes

259
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:15,810
Go tell An-Pin, to feel relief

260
00:15:16,055 --> 00:15:18,437
and accompany me to visit the King

261
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,529
Your Majesty, you should rest

262
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:22,578
You don't feel good recently too

263
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,000
If the King knows this after he wakes up

264
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,896
He'll blame us for not serving you well

265
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:28,101
You fool

266
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:30,675
Am I more important than the King?

267
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,200
ZhuXi, please help me up

268
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,200
Yes

269
00:15:38,774 --> 00:15:40,903
Miss

270
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
Ah Jin just came.

271
00:15:42,716 --> 00:15:45,519
there's a news from the palace,<br> saying that the King is not feeling well

272
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:48,060
they've called the Lord to go to the palace quickly

273
00:15:48,123 --> 00:15:50,862
I heard that its really serious

274
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:52,876
Did they said what sickness was that?

275
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,300
This.. I don't really know too<br>just heard from the King's close servant that..

276
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,900
seems like the King got fever when he stayed overnight in An-Pin's place

277
00:16:01,976 --> 00:16:04,501
after all, the palace is keeping it secretive

278
00:16:04,603 --> 00:16:06,291
The King is very attentive

279
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,984
its hard to avoid being overly worried and become sick now

280
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,700
This time when the Lord left for the palace, <br>will he gets to stay in NingHui Hall?

281
00:16:11,997 --> 00:16:12,889
Yes

282
00:16:12,944 --> 00:16:16,395
The Lord gets called by the Great Empress to go to the palace <br>along with Duke Heng and Knight Shen

283
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:19,608
It seems that the King is seriously ill this time

284
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:23,702
So he can't leave the palace these few days?

285
00:16:24,074 --> 00:16:27,076
The Lord has to serve upon the King in the palace so he can't come out<br>but I'm ok

286
00:16:27,971 --> 00:16:30,636
The Lord knows that he can't visit you these few days

287
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:33,634
So he requested me to send this to you

288
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
when madam you have a free time, please reply to him on this

289
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,900
I will come here everyday

290
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,900
to deliver what madam writes for the Lord

291
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:45,603
~The poem~<br>Trying the new shirt on the mountain

292
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,124
The cozy weather is making me Iazy

293
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,600
The birds are singing on the tree, I am not abIe to come back

294
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:57,090
He can't Ieave the paIace as he<br>has to take care of His Majesty

295
00:16:57,212 --> 00:17:00,925
Yet he says that he doesn't want to come<br>Because of the birds

296
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,986
He's the only one who wrote in such elegant yet wild way

297
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,102
~Second poem~

298
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:18,923
My beIoved is Ieaving

299
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:22,549
But I am not dare to make a confession

300
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,900
I can just turn back

301
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:29,779
And waIk away

302
00:17:32,837 --> 00:17:36,262
Send this to the Lord <br> tell him not to reply everyday

303
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:40,314
first its going to be really obvious, <br> secondly, he'll be pretty tired serving upon in the palace

304
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,180
Madam you're very thoughtful <br> I'll definitely keep this tight

305
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:48,491
The Lord can't leave the palace these few days <br> so these are his babies

306
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:52,910
The Lord definitely reads it day and night <br> and miss you so much

307
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,396
The Great Empress has arrived

308
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,700
Greeting, Empress dowager

309
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,242
just stand up

310
00:18:04,678 --> 00:18:07,410
Has the King woke up yet?

311
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:13,600
Not yet<br>The imperiaI doctor said that<br>His Majesty is having fever

312
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:27,125
It needs some times for<br>him to come to his sense

313
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:30,954
These days

314
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:36,727
His Majesty was being<br>Too fickIe

315
00:18:39,556 --> 00:18:43,912
I know that he is sad

316
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:49,495
And know that he is aII heart

317
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:55,068
But he spoiIed his body

318
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:59,632
Take good care of him<br>Send someone to report to me

319
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:04,761
Just Iet His Majesty to rest<br>Don't disturb him

320
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,200
Yes

321
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:08,100
We wiII handIe the domestic affair

322
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,900
Don't worry

323
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:16,125
Then I wiII go back first

324
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:18,549
Do keep him company

325
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,700
Yes

326
00:19:26,323 --> 00:19:27,124
Huan-Huan

327
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:32,178
Huan-Huan

328
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:33,913
What

329
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:37,695
Brother is missing Zhen Huan

330
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:41,680
Is she the one

331
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,586
Whom brother can't Iet go in these years

332
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:49,971
He is a man of aII heart

333
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:53,918
This shouId appear in royaI

334
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,200
His Majesty can't hoId<br>a candIe to you in this

335
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:14,170
Miss

336
00:20:20,314 --> 00:20:21,809
Fourth poem

337
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:25,354
The sound of the weaving machine is Ioud

338
00:20:25,987 --> 00:20:28,362
I can't heIp

339
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,898
Missing you

340
00:20:32,253 --> 00:20:35,235
I miss you so badIy

341
00:20:42,848 --> 00:20:44,131
Fifth poem

342
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,900
Nobody understands

343
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:53,194
What I am trying to teII

344
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,900
I don't want to taIk<br>about my current situation

345
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,900
What I am doing is using this poem<br>to teII you how badIy I miss you

346
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,500
Drink some ginseng tea

347
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,630
I don't want to drink

348
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,700
AIthough you are worrying about His Majesty. But you have to take care of yourseIf

349
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,555
How am I going to be at ease<br>By seeing that His Majesty<br>hasn't come to his sense

350
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,662
You have the chance to see His Majesty

351
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,400
Me and consort An<br>Have no the chance at aII

352
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:30,307
We can just worry about him

353
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
We are useIess

354
00:21:32,575 --> 00:21:37,207
We can onIy care about your heaIth. You have to do So many things at once

355
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,984
Yet we don't know when wiII<br>His Majesty come to his sense

356
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,649
Look at you You Iook paIe

357
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:46,840
You might faII sick too

358
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,200
If you don't take care of your body

359
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:04,241
Just drink some ginseng tea

360
00:22:07,504 --> 00:22:11,488
Anyway, His Majesty feII sick in<br>HaII of ProIonged Happiness

361
00:22:11,523 --> 00:22:13,572
Consort An must be invoIved

362
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,200
LuckiIy the empress dowager<br>didn't bIame it on me<br>Or I wiII be in troubIe

363
00:22:19,544 --> 00:22:22,662
It is my fauIt<br>That I didn't serve His Majesty niceIy

364
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,900
Why wouId His Majesty go to you<br>If you don't know to serve him niceIy

365
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,900
His Majesty seIdom Iooked for the consorts

366
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:38,901
Just Iike consort Qi

367
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,000
She hasn't been seeing His Majesty aIone<br>You have to appreciate it

368
00:22:45,174 --> 00:22:46,760
Thank you

369
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,100
Stand up

370
00:22:48,465 --> 00:22:49,117
Yes

371
00:22:51,345 --> 00:22:52,301
Yes

372
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:58,000
The Empress Dowager doesn't<br>aIIow you to go there now

373
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,900
You might go to pray for His Majesty in the tempIe

374
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:01,545
Yes

375
00:23:10,645 --> 00:23:12,192
The empress was born in<br>oId and weII-known famiIy

376
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:14,769
Therefore she Iikes the women<br>from the same type of famiIy

377
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:19,205
PeopIe Iike you who have bad origin<br>Is Iucky enough

378
00:23:19,338 --> 00:23:20,851
To be aIIowed to serve her

379
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,100
You shouId appreciate it<br>Do you stiII want to fight with me

380
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,100
Yes

381
00:23:37,702 --> 00:23:39,522
Set off

382
00:23:45,753 --> 00:23:47,408
You haven't been having rest

383
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:50,313
Why don't you take a nap first

384
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,000
No

385
00:23:52,954 --> 00:23:57,447
I haven't been<br>Seeing His Majesty

386
00:23:58,554 --> 00:24:02,159
For so Iong time

387
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,900
Your Majesty

388
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:10,662
Your Majesty

389
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:12,301
You are awake

390
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,330
Get some water for His Majesty

391
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,891
A mountain wiII be weII known when there is immortaI Iiving on it

392
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:26,600
A river wiII be weII known where<br>there is dragon Iiving in it

393
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:29,656
This is a crude house

394
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,516
But

395
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:31,527
the resident is having good behaviour <br>Hong-Shi

396
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:35,029
Mother

397
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,000
Hong-Shi

398
00:24:36,077 --> 00:24:38,711
Mother You<br>Why are you here

399
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,000
His Majesty has just<br>recovered from the fever

400
00:24:42,587 --> 00:24:44,853
He is stiII in coma

401
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,400
Then Why didn't you go to serve him<br>I come to visit you<br>When the empress went to find him

402
00:24:50,453 --> 00:24:55,550
Hong-Shi Mother hasn't been<br>TaIking with you for two months

403
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,400
Mother<br>I miss you too

404
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,200
Hong-Shi

405
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,600
Don't be too hardworking

406
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,700
You Iook Thinner now

407
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,600
Mother wants me to study everyday

408
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:19,005
Then onIy father wiII Iike me

409
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,500
The empress is not your bioIogicaI mother

410
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
She won't Iove you whoIeheartedIy

411
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,500
You are the onIy

412
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,775
Son in the paIace

413
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,200
You have to be the ruIer when you grow up

414
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,500
How couId your father not Ioving you

415
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,700
Hong-Shi

416
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,900
Good boy

417
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,800
Be carefuI

418
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,200
Take care of yourseIf

419
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,400
I wiII be sad if you faII sick

420
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,900
Mother

421
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,300
I have begged the empress for many times

422
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,900
But

423
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,300
she didn't aIIowed me to visit you<br>As I have many homework

424
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,100
Mother

425
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,400
I even went to the entrance of<br>PaIace of EternaI Spring to find you

426
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,200
But I saw nobody

427
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,100
The empress aIways didn't

428
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,700
AIIow me to visit you too

429
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,700
She didn't want me to disturb you

430
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,500
She didn't even aIIow me

431
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,100
To send you a shirt

432
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,500
And

433
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,200
food

434
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,300
I reaIIy regret it

435
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,700
Mother

436
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,900
What did you regret

437
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,700
It's my fauIt

438
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,400
That I can't breed you

439
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,700
You are my hope

440
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,400
I won't have

441
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,000
To Iive in fears anymore

442
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,500
When you become the ruIer

443
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,900
I want to fight for mother

444
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,700
I wiII honor you as the empress dowager<br>And make up to you

445
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,300
Good boy

446
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,700
Did consort Qi reaIIy<br>teII third prince Iike this

447
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,700
I heard it It's reaI

448
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,700
You treated third prince

449
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,000
So niceIy

450
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,400
But he is not your own son

451
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,500
I feIt hurt to hear it

452
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,300
Third prince has grown up

453
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,000
He is the same Iike other chiIdren

454
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,300
But fourth prince is shy

455
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,600
Fifth prince is weak

456
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,300
They are sunIess

457
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,700
It's fine that third<br>prince is not mature enough

458
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,500
Consort Qi is more muddIeheaded

459
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,200
But third prince stiII obeys your order

460
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,100
He has become more hardworking

461
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
But you reaIIy

462
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,600
Wasted your effort to protect consort Qi

463
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,300
Consort Qi doesn't know

464
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,600
To repay me

465
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,900
No matter how I

466
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,500
Teach him

467
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,000
It is a bad thing for third

468
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,600
prince to have such mother

469
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,300
Even she wants to be the empress dowager.

470
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Who does she think she is

471
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,000
She can be

472
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,700
She is the mother of third prince

473
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
After third prince's accession

474
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:24,800
She wiII Surpass me<br>And become the empress dowager

475
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,900
Look at consort Qi<br>She can't wait to teach<br>these to third prince

476
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,400
Those are her true feeIing

477
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,300
Why can't she teach him

478
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,500
I thought that

479
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,900
She wiII be contented

480
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,500
To be a consort

481
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,032
I reaIIy underestimated her

482
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,400
Lady

483
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,200
We can't have two tigers on a mountain

484
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,000
She is not a tiger

485
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,900
But a cat

486
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,600
Just a weak cat

487
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,800
Lord

488
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,200
Lan-Yi

489
00:29:09,257 --> 00:29:10,924
Why are you entering the paIace

490
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,800
I am Ieaving

491
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,800
Why

492
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,900
His Majesty has just<br>recovered from the fever

493
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,400
The empress dowager said tha tWe don't have to perform in this year. Therefore we are going back first

494
00:29:19,615 --> 00:29:21,386
His Majesty

495
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:22,536
has just recovered

496
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,700
He must be amazed to see you

497
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,200
The empress dowager is reaIIy<br>doing that for His Majesty's good

498
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,400
Lord,

499
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,700
Since when you became so gIib

500
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,200
I am not gIib

501
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,300
You Iook good

502
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,600
In this attire

503
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,700
You haven't been coming to Summer PaIace

504
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,900
I wiII go visit you

505
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,200
when I am free

506
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,300
Bear it in your mind

507
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,400
Sure

508
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,000
Let's go

509
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
I am

510
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,900
So exhausted

511
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,700
Your Majesty

512
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,300
You have just recovered from the sickness

513
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Take care of your heaIth

514
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,200
Where shouId I go to have a waIk

515
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,700
Do you want to go to find consort Hui

516
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,100
She did the most thing to take care of you

517
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,712
When you feII sick

518
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,300
Consort Hui is good

519
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,800
But I am weary of Iooking at her

520
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,300
It's because you aIways met Very pretty women in the past

521
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,800
Therefore you are weary of seeing her

522
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,600
You are so mean

523
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,700
You saw the main point

524
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,800
Say something aboout consort An

525
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,400
She isn't educated

526
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,800
But she can comfort you

527
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,300
by singing

528
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,200
AIthough consort Qi

529
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,900
is gentIe too

530
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,700
But you feeI as if

531
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,200
there are something Iess

532
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
The baIanced consort is consort Wan

533
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Don't mention about her

534
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,000
Why don't you go to

535
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,800
Consort An

536
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,100
or consort Qi

537
00:31:08,111 --> 00:31:09,115
Forget it

538
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,300
I wiII go to Summer PaIace

539
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
Yes

540
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,500
Seventh poem

541
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,000
We are afraid of being together

542
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,500
As we don't want to be apart

543
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,000
How are we going

544
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,900
To be together again

545
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,900
If we are forced to part

546
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,800
Why did you write so pessimistic poem

547
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,700
I haven't been seeing for days

548
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
I was afraid

549
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,400
Don't mention this again

550
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,800
No matter what

551
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,400
I kept Iooking at the stars

552
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,500
And missing you

553
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,000
But it is too bad that

554
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,000
You can't aIways see me Iike this

555
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,100
Su Pei-Sheng

556
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,600
Why do I feeI

557
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,600
So weary of the women in the paIace

558
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,500
I can't find anything speciaI

559
00:32:24,516 --> 00:32:26,444
By Iooking at anyone of them

560
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,200
Your Majesty I have no idea

561
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,100
Why don't we choose new girIs

562
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,200
It is useIess

563
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,400
They onIy know<br>To fIatter me

564
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,200
They are aII the same

565
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,400
But I think they are different

566
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
They have their own speciaIity

567
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,600
Here reaIIy has a variety of horses

568
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,700
What nonsense are you uttering

569
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,600
What is this pIace

570
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,800
Your Majesty It's Hundred-Horse Park here

571
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,000
Here trains the horse that are imported from other pIaces

572
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,000
Go and take a Iook

573
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,900
His Majesty is here

574
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,400
Greeting, Your Majesty

575
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Eunuch Duan

576
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,400
Eunuch Su

577
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Who is the girI on the horse

578
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,200
She

579
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,800
She is the horse trainer Ye Lan-Yi

580
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,900
Horse trainer

581
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,900
You are Iucky

582
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,400
What did you see<br>Or why did you hear

583
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,000
It seems Iike<br>You are not happy

584
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,100
Huan-Huan

585
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,200
My brother caIIed your name

586
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,500
When he was in coma

587
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,800
I stayed in the paIace for days

588
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,000
AIthough I just heard him caIIing you for once

589
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,300
But stiII, I am afraid

590
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,900
Huan-Huan

591
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,000
I am afraid

592
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,900
that I might Iose you

593
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,600
Then the person that His Majesty caIIed<br>Is empress Chun-Yuan,

594
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,600
Huan-Huan, am I right

595
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Yes

596
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,400
He aIways stayed aIone<br>And saw the remnant of<br>Empress Chun-Yuan

597
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
He is thinking of<br>Empress Chun-Yuan when he cIear

598
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,500
He caIIed me in his dream

599
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,600
As I Iook aIike empress Chun-Yuan

600
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,900
Sometimes he thinks of

601
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,100
Me when he is

602
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,100
Thinking of empress Chun-Yuan

603
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,300
Moreover I was chased out from the paIace

604
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,500
How couId I go back again

605
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,000
Huan-Huan

606
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000

607
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,300
MyseIf so timid

608
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I am afraid

609
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,400
that something might happen

610
00:36:01,445 --> 00:36:02,753
No

611
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,700
It wiII never

612
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000

He is bitten by snake

629
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000

Thank you for saving me

649
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,400
LuckiIy Dzungarian are strong

650
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,800
Or

651
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,200
you might have died

652
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,300
How do you know that I am Dzungarian

653
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,500
Your shirt does not have probIem

654
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,600
But you were saying the Ianguage of Dzungarian just now

655
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,800
Huan-Huan toId me that

656
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,400
There are probIems with your hands

657
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,400
The caIIus on your hands

658
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,900
Is caused by archery

659
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,700
