Episode 51

2
00:00:03,594 --> 00:00:05,872
What a clever woman

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,000
Do you know what I do

4
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:13,053
to clever women?

5
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:15,478
Kill me?

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,627
but people who were saved do not kill their savior

7
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:24,011
I never thought of killing you

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,500
Smart women who are also beautiful

9
00:00:31,353 --> 00:00:34,677
It's very easy for people to like them

10
00:00:34,727 --> 00:00:35,569
This brother here

11
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:38,242
Your comment is a little out of bound

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,800
When we like something, we like them

13
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:47,910
Not only like them

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,700
We want to own them

15
00:00:59,039 --> 00:00:59,918
Don't forget

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,000
this is my country

17
00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:12,601
There

18
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:17,601
will be a day, that it can be ours as well ours

19
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:22,973
We just saved your life

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,900
We can also kill you

21
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:28,804
With your ability?

22
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:31,288
It won't be that easy

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Your Great Qing had a general named Nian Geng Yao in the past

24
00:01:37,123 --> 00:01:41,894
but recently you don't even have anyone near his ability

25
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:46,346
not one that is comparable

26
00:01:47,826 --> 00:01:49,776
I won't even bat an eye

27
00:01:50,312 --> 00:01:51,866
but you're lucky

28
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,900
because you're hurt

29
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:01,695
Sir!

30
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:03,951
Sir!

31
00:02:04,914 --> 00:02:06,321
Sir!

32
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:10,571
You made us search for you so hard

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,300
What happened?

34
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:17,123
Just now, i was bitten by a snake

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,700
Luckily they saved me

36
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,114
Thank you sir and miss

37
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,590
for saving our master

38
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:32,231
This master better becareful the next time he goes out

39
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:36,835
Maybe next time, you won't be so carefree like today

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,000
I understand the meaning of your words

41
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,900
Of course as I can see that you're someone who values your life

42
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,959
Judging from what you say

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,522
you know half about me already

44
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,488
You think that I know half about you

45
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:58,100
but it will be my fortune not to ever bump into you again

46
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,100
Please excuse me

47
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,442
Come, sir

48
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,700
Master

49
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:09,159
Slowly

50
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,821
Let's go

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,000
Thank you

52
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:25,438
Let's go

53
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,400
Why did you bring so many books? Where did you get it from?

54
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,614
I brought those that Wang Ye liked

55
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:40,778
He asked them to bring it over today

56
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:43,825
I only need a few books

57
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,000
Why do you want so many from him?

58
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:48,810
Miss...teach me how to read and write can you?

59
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,000
Did you not want to learn before?

60
00:03:53,352 --> 00:03:55,399
why the change of mind?

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,000
Isn't it better for me to know a little reading?

62
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,566
Missy always loves these

63
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:03,166
so i want to understand it as well

64
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:05,003
I can keep you company and kill boredom

65
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:08,251
Missy now has Wang Ye

66
00:04:08,714 --> 00:04:10,476
You're like a pair of celestial lovers

67
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,100
Don't you want my company anymore?

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,600
Don't argue with me

69
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:17,708
Let me ask you

70
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
These two past two days

71
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,374
you've heard everything didn't you?

72
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:26,603
Since you guessed it already

73
00:04:27,111 --> 00:04:28,871
I won't hide it anymore either

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,900
Missy and Wang Ye are so knowledgeable

75
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,200
Your conversations flow so smoothly

76
00:04:35,712 --> 00:04:37,264
I don't even know anything

77
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,600
The other day, the both of you were creating poems together

78
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:46,995
I felt like a block of wood standing there

79
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,700
It was so embarassing

80
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:52,761
It's great that you're motivated

81
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,600
as long as you want to learn, I am willing to teach you

82
00:04:57,686 --> 00:05:01,395
but as a girl, to know a book, the smarter you become

83
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,400
and this will create more headache in the future

84
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,700
But that's ok

85
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,400
Go and ask your little master out

86
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Also Sun Gong Gong

87
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,500
you don't understand him. He doesn't trust anyone

88
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,700
Now it's only her new horse

89
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,000
she refused to come out

90
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,500
If you want to wait here, you will be waiting about two to three hours

91
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,200
then you won't do your big duties

92
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,600
Haiyoo...my dear grandma

93
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,700
She can escape out of it, I can't

94
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,700
I have to serve the Emperor

95
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,400
Sun Gong Gong! I know you're scared of horses

96
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,346
Don't be afraid, the horse is dangerous

97
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,200
but with little master around

98
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,900
it will not hurt you

99
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,600
Your Majesty, why do you fancy such a woman?

100
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,500
Little Master, you're finally out to receive the edict

101
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:15,036
If you have something to say just say it!

102
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,300
Emporer has an order

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,100
Little Master, sorry

104
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,300
You should kneel to recieve the order

105
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,400
By divine edict of the Emperor,

106
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,900
Ms. Ye of Yuanming Garden is intelligent and refined.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,700
She's to be conferred the title of Promise, <br>and taken into the palace to reside. End of edict.

108
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,100
Young Mistress, you have to express your gratitude.

109
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,300
Thanks.

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Congratulations, Young Mistress Ye.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,600
You're really fortunate.

112
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,300
All the females in the palace start from being an Official Lady.

113
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,200
Your first step, and you're already a Promise.

114
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,400
If I gave this fortune to you, would you want it?

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,200
Young Mistress, you're joking.

116
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,100
You should start packing quickly and get ready to enter the palace.

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,700
Where will I be staying in the harem?

118
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,300
The Internal Affairs department will make the arrangements.

119
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,000
What the Internal Affairs Department arranges is their own problem!

120
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,100
Since the Emperor likes me, <br>why is the Internal Affairs Department getting involved?

121
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,500
By nature, I don't like noise and excitement.

122
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Gonggong, please tell His Majesty to arrange a place for me that is quiet and far away from everyone else.

123
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,400
Yes.

124
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
His Majesty will definitely make the arrangements.

125
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,000
Young Mistress, please enter the palace quickly.

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,500
You still have to express your gratitude to the Emperor.

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,400
I won't be able to wait for him to come anymore.

128
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,500
I still promised to perform for him.

129
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,300
Young Mistress, whom are you referring to?

130
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:47,162
Why do you care who I'm talking about?

131
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,900
Look at this fish. <br>Its eyes are protruding out.

132
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,300
This fish is pretty.

133
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,300
Greetings, Empress Dowager, Empress, and Consort Qi.

134
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,800
Get up.

135
00:08:08,808 --> 00:08:10,384
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

136
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,900
I had no choice but to call you over despite how busy you are.

137
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,700
Your servant doesn't dare.

138
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:19,369
The matter has been done secretly.

139
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:22,822
But sooner or later, she'll have to stay in one of the palaces.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,600
How long does His Majesty intend to hide it from me?

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm asking you.

142
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,000
Has the new girl entered the palace yet?

143
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,500
What new girl? <br>How did I not know of it?

144
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,800
His Majesty finds you magnanimous and of good character.

145
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,400
Always approving, never rejecting.

146
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,400
So he dares to pull all kinds of people into the palace.

147
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,700
Empress Dowager, don't be angry.

148
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:49,924
It's just her status that is a little low.

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,500
It's a bit similar to Lady Miaoyin in the past. <br>That's all.

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,300
At most, it'll be like the previous Eight Prince's mother.

151
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,100
Only a lowly slave.

152
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,000
That lowly slave was at least a servant official

153
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,500
The one His Majesty has picked this time...

154
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,100
is a horse trainer from Yuanming Garden...

155
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,200
who performs shows.

156
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,700
Empress Dowager,

157
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,400
she has already entered the palace.

158
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Because she was at Yuan Ming Yuan and couldn't enter the palace

159
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,200
The emperor was worrying day and night

160
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,300
He titled her as Promise, and had her brought into the palace.

161
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,600
Has it been decided where she will be staying?

162
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:29,939
Not yet.

163
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,100
But Promise Ye said...

164
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:35,753
that she wants to stay somewhere quiet with few people.

165
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:37,331
Hear that, all of you.

166
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,775
She's just entered the palace,<br>and she's already making demands.

167
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,400
Exactly.

168
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,600
Has His Majesty mentioned where is to be given to her?

169
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,000
We have to wait 2 days before they clean up the room

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,900
His Majesty said for her to stay at <br>Yang Xin Hall's side wing for the time being.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,700
How can that be allowed?

172
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,300
Tell the Emperor...

173
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:59,564
Chun Xi Hall in Shou Kang Palace is empty

174
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,400
Get someone to clean it up immediately for her.

175
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,200
Yes

176
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:04,001
Chunxi Hall is to be given to her?

177
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,300
Isn't that too much of an honor for her?

178
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:07,819
Naturally not.

179
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:10,068
In a situation like this,

180
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,100
I'm afraid that she will be promoted again

181
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,700
She likes the quiet.

182
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,600
There are no place more quiet than Shou Kang Palace

183
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Let her live right under my watch,

184
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,300
and she won't be able to play any tricks.

185
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,000
Dispense with ceremony. Sit.

186
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,100
Why?

187
00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:54,796
You're not happy?

188
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,600
Are you not used to living here?

189
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,700
It's the same everywhere.

190
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,300
You've been here for a few days now.

191
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
I haven't seen you smile once.

192
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,200
If you feel that the palace is constrained,

193
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,000
I'll take you to Yuanming Garden for a few days when I'm free.

194
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,000
Your Majesty is busy with Court.

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,300
You don't have to worry about me.

196
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,900
Furthermore, not smiling...

197
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,900
is because by nature, I do not like to smile.

198
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,700
No other reason.

199
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,000
Actually, when you don't smile, you're even prettier.

200
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,200
Niangniang, <br>how did His Majesty title such a lowly lass as a Promise?

201
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Empress...

202
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,200
The ancestral rules state that when a courtier is titled,

203
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,100
they have to start from a lady official

204
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,100
Ye Lanyi is not a courtier. Moreover, the Emperor likes her. <br>What's impossible?

205
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,800
She was titled in the afternoon, had dinner with the Emperor

206
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,200
And at night she was sent into Yangxin Hall<br> to attend to consummate the union.

207
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,000
For these few days, His Majesty has only had relations with her!

208
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,300
I have never seen His Majesty like that before.

209
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,900
You've never seen it? <br>I've never seen it too!

210
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,300
This is what deviousness and cunning means

211
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,600
Today, when I went to Yangxin Hall to pay my respects,

212
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,000
I saw Promise Ye's appearance.

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,100
Her aura so uncouth.

214
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,800
What on earth does His Majesty like about her?

215
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,100
If Concubine Qi has the ability,

216
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,500
why doesn't she display that aura too?

217
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,700
His Majesty will like it too.

218
00:12:22,386 --> 00:12:24,112
For Ms. Ye to receive this much favor...

219
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:25,637
is worrying indeed.

220
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,100
If she were to spawn some lowly creature someday,

221
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,400
who knows what would happen?

222
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,300
If Heaven were protecting us,

223
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,100
may she never give birth.

224
00:12:47,252 --> 00:13:02,460
<br>

225
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,000
Promise Ye.

226
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,800
Seventeenth Prince?

227
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You're here?

228
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,500
I haven't seen you for some time,

229
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,000
and you're now a Promise.

230
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,700
No one ask if I was willing to or not.

231
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,300
And here I am in the palace.

232
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,800
And I'm a Promise.

233
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,500
I heard about what happened to you.

234
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,900
You seem depressed

235
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,600
Everything here is so dirty.

236
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,900
My Hundred Horse Garden is still the cleanest

237
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,200
Do you still remember that year?

238
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,900
You had a high fever.

239
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:03,684
I remember.

240
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,300
That was seven years ago...

241
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,000
I was ill and almost dying.

242
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,300
No one would care about a lowly slave like me.

243
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,900
It was you who saw me by chance,

244
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,800
and had the Imperial Physician save me.

245
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,200
When I first saved you then,

246
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,700
it wasn't to see you...

247
00:14:17,713 --> 00:14:18,958
so filled with despair today.

248
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,791
But what else can I do?

249
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,200
I can't go where I want to.

250
00:14:24,303 --> 00:14:25,806
And where I'm staying...

251
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,200
makes me feel disgusted.

252
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,000
and fills me with utter hopelessness.

253
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,800
You have to take care of yourself

254
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,500
My memory of Ye Lanyi...

255
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
has a beautiful smile, and a strong character.

256
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,700
No matter bitter it is, <br>she'll find a way to find the sweetness in it and be happy.

257
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
I have never been able to repay...

258
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,800
you for your kindness many years ago, my lord.

259
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:51,862
Since you want me to live well,

260
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:54,103
I will definitely listen to you.

261
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,800
That's great.

262
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,600
Huan Er.

263
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,700
Why did you come so suddenly?

264
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,800
When I was done with my errands, <br>I rushed over to meet you.

265
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,500
Before..didn't I say that my heart was unease?

266
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,500
I've thought of something that will allow both our hearts to be at ease.

267
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,500
A marriage notice?

268
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,700
Yes, a marriage notice.

269
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
I'm a person your imperial brother threw out.

270
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,400
Furthermore, I'm a guilty woman...

271
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,600
whose future is unknown.

272
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,500
Why are you doing this?

273
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,700
A contract for a lifetime.

274
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,200
Forever binding.

275
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,900
Huan Huan.

276
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,200
In this whole world, I only want you.

277
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,700
Zhen Huan.

278
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,700
I pray for a live a peaceful and quiet life with you

279
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,500
Huan Er.

280
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,100
I will definitely do as you wish.

281
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,700
I know

282
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,100
It's just a foolish dream of mine

283
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,600
that's ultimately futile

284
00:17:22,772 --> 00:17:24,394
Believe me

285
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,300
After Imperial Brother has slowly forgotten about you,

286
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,400
I will get Abbess Jing'an to announce your death

287
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,736
We'll change our names, and go far away from here.

288
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,000
And live the rest of our lives out together

289
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,300
Huan Er, what are you doing?

290
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:19,903
You and I, husband and wife, will be one.

291
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,800
One forever, never to part.

292
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,100
Your Majesty seldom lets me interfere with Court matters

293
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,400
There is some unrest in Tibet

294
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,500
A'er'buba intends to escape to Zhunge'er'bu

295
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,300
Although Poluonai moved his own troops to settle the matter,

296
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,400
I think

297
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,900
that for every day of unrest in Zhunge'erbu

298
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
The matter of Tibet cannot be resolved

299
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,100
If it cannot be resolved,

300
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,500
the Mongols will be suspicious

301
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:21,920
And these two parties may pose a worry for our country

302
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,725
Although I have titled some officials

303
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:30,302
and made plans to gather troops for Zhuge'erbu

304
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,900
But there are many matters that have not been clarified

305
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,200
I need you to make a trip to scout out the information

306
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,300
Although Imperial Brother wishes to give me this task

307
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,600
But I am not talented

308
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,400
I want to use you

309
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,900
Precisely because you don't have many ties in Court

310
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,500
If you go in plain clothes, most people won't recognise you

311
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Now the stretch along Yunnan

312
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,100
is filled with spies from Zhunge'er'bu

313
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,600
I'm afraid of alerting the enemy

314
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,600
Also,

315
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,500
if we do end up raising the military against Zhunge'er'bu

316
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,300
It'll be faster to move the troops from Gansu, Yunnan

317
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,500
Imperial Consort Shu is from Yunnan

318
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,900
For you to make a trip to Yunnan is more appropriate

319
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,800
Although your brother is untalented, since Your Majesty has asked, I cannot decline

320
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,200
I will do my best

321
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,500
Good

322
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,100
Go and get ready, leave and return early

323
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,800
Your brother takes his leave

324
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,700
Su Pei Sheng

325
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,200
Your Majesty

326
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,300
Call for Minister Zhang Ting Yu

327
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,500
Yes

328
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,800
Your Official pays his respects to you

329
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,100
Get up.

330
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,800
I summoned you here today...

331
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,300
because of the matter regarding Prince Guo advancing to Yunnan.

332
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,900
You must send some trustworthy people to protect him in secret.

333
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,100
At the same time,

334
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,100
prevent him from getting too involved in politics.

335
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Every time he reaches a location,

336
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,200
whom he speaks to, what he does...

337
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,000
investigate it closely and report it back promptly.

338
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,300
Yes.

339
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,153
Physician Wen.

340
00:21:58,153 --> 00:22:00,000
Is the medicine ready?

341
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,100
Yes.

342
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,400
Be careful when you use it.

343
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,300
Many thanks.

344
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,100
Don't thank me.

345
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,800
I'm just afraid for Huan Er's wellbeing.

346
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,400
Still, many thanks.

347
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,000
Why were you so careless when you dismounted your horse?

348
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,700
Such a good cloak, needlessly ripped

349
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,800
I thought about the fact that I hadn't seen you for four days already.

350
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,500
So I hurried when I got off the horse.

351
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,400
It's just a clothing. It isn't worth much.

352
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,300
The mountain roads are slippery in the snow and it's easy for the horse to slip

353
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,900
What's the point of you rushing over here?

354
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,500
This time you cut your clothing, what if the next time you hurt yourself?

355
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,400
Are you intentionally out to make me worry?

356
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,200
I'll just promise you then.

357
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,500
I don't want to hurt myself either.

358
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,200
If I'm hurt, how will I come to see you?

359
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,000
What a slippery tongue.

360
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,800
If you tear your clothing again next time,<br>who's going to repair it for you?

361
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,300
I'll just leave you to wear a torn clothing all over.

362
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,900
You're leaving tomorrow?

363
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,400
23rd of the 12th month. In about a month.

364
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,700
I can't delay any longer. Looks like I won't be spending the New Year's in the capital

365
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,100
In 40 days will you be back?

366
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,500
I will definitely be back within 40 days.

367
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,300
40 days.

368
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,000
Another full cycle of the moon.

369
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,900
40 days are very short!

370
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,789
I've already made all the arrangements.

371
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,100
When I come back this time,

372
00:23:48,163 --> 00:23:49,692
I will take you to leave this place.

373
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,000
Really?

374
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
This is...?

375
00:24:04,471 --> 00:24:06,110
It seems like fragrance powder.

376
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,254
It's a medicine from Physician Wen

377
00:24:07,254 --> 00:24:08,800
to fake death

378
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,300
It's called the "7-day Unconscious Powder"

379
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,100
Made from Datura flowers

380
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,500
After taking it, it'll be like you've stopped breathing

381
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,700
Exactly like a dead person

382
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,100
7 days later you'll be able to wake up

383
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,500
In the end, he's still willing to help me

384
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,500
Physician Wen has indeed put in a lot of effort for us

385
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:31,378
We should really thank him

386
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,300
I've made the preparations

387
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,200
Once everything is in place

388
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,700
Huan Er.

389
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,500
When that time comes, <br>we'll be together forever.

390
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,900
I'll wait for you to come back, and wait for everything to be resolved

391
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,900
Only then can I rest easy

392
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,300
Huan'er. This is a matter of governance

393
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,000
I can't not go.

394
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,400
It's just 40 days.

395
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,200
I will definitely wait for you.

396
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,800
In the past, my aunt from Jiangnan

397
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,000
There's a bridge on the west lake in Hangzhou called the "Long Bridge"

398
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,200
Long Bridge?

399
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,100
Is the bridge very long?

400
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,400
Actually the bridge isn't very long

401
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,100
It's called the Long Bridge

402
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:19,381
because the locals always say

403
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,900
that Liang Shan Bo bo Zhu Ying Tai (famous historical lovers) said their goodbyes there

404
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,500
Unwilling to let go of each other

405
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,300
So the short bridge seemed like a really long one

406
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,200
The pain of separation

407
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,000
has been the same since the ancient times

408
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,700
I don't want us to be Liang Shan Bo and Zhu Ying Tai

409
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,400
She married crying and he died young throwing up blood

410
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,317
In the end they could only leave the Earth as butterflies

411
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,800
We're much luckier than they were

412
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,100
What was I thinking? Making an analogy out of them...

413
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:53,372
I'm thinking too much today

414
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,300
So I can't really stomach any inauspicious words

415
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
It seems like a man's heart

416
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,200
that is in the hand's of his love

417
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,900
can no longer be free and easy

418
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,100
Go and be free and easy

419
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,200
Prince Guo is suave

420
00:26:09,452 --> 00:26:12,665
Is he afraid that no other beautiful ladies would pine after him?

421
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,000
You, really! Bullying me this way

422
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,900
You're trying to make me angry

423
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,700
Who asked you to speak nonsense?

424
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,900
Although the flowers are blooming

425
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,030
But please hurry back

426
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,100
because I will wait for you here

427
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,600
With you here

428
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,200
I will return home as expediently as possible

429
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:05,700
<br>

430
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,600
Huan'er!

431
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
Huan'er!

432
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,700
Huan'er

433
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,300
I will return very quickly

434
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,900
I wait for your return

435
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,500
Wait for me

436
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,700
I wait for your return!

437
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,500
I wait for your return

438
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,100
My lady.

439
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,200
I've sent the blankets to Anxi Hall as you've instructed

440
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,500
Imperial Consort sends along her regards

441
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,900
and said that Wang'ye will be home soon

442
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,700
At that time, the both of you should go together to pay your respects

443
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,400
These two days I've been feeling lazy and sleepy

444
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,500
But Yun Li will be back within 10 days

445
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,100
I can always go with him then

446
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,900
Priestess Mochou, an esteemed guest from the palace has come.

447
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,200
Jiejie!

448
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,500
Huan Er!

449
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,400
It's all my fault!<br>I waited till today to come see you.

450
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,500
Sit.

451
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,500
This is our first time seeing each other in a few years, why are we crying?

452
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,000
Out of the blue, how could you let my sister stay in such a secluded place?

453
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,200
When I came over from Ganlu Temple, <br>even on a sedan, it took a whole hour!

454
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,700
Is this how Ganlu Temple looks after women from the palace who come here to pray?

455
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,200
I've been sick recently

456
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,100
That's why I moved here to recuperate

457
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,800
It's not the abbess' fault

458
00:30:19,846 --> 00:30:21,707
Mochou is kind

459
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,500
Yes, yes.

460
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,400
Mochou was sick, that's why she was moved here

461
00:30:28,086 --> 00:30:29,816
All of you go out and wait

462
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:32,133
I have private words to speak to Mochou

463
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,100
Yes.

464
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,587
Other people aside,

465
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,100
Priestess Jing Bai is hale and healthy

466
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,200
Go and sweep the snow off the path towards the palace

467
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,500
In order to show your sincerity to my lady, please complete this task alone

468
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Yes.

469
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,100
Why are you making things difficult for her like that?

470
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,400
You've been thoroughly humiliated at Ganlu Temple!

471
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,800
Not at all.

472
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,400
You're still trying to hide it from me?

473
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,300
Do you think I really don't know?

474
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,400
You were dismissed from the palace under disgraceful circumstances

475
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,900
Which person on this earth doesn't look down on the disgraced?

476
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,800
Even if one is a nun, they may not be able to look past it

477
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,100
When I wanted to come see you

478
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,300
that Jing Bai continuously tried to rebuff me

479
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,800
First she said the weather was cold. <br>Then she said the road was slippery.

480
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,400
I just said a few sentences to you, <br>and she already looked so guilty!

481
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,800
Obviously, she has been bullying you all these days.

482
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:31,532
I punished her in front of you.

483
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,700
On one hand, it is to punish her

484
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,200
On the other hand, it is to show that you weren't the one that put me up to punishing her

485
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,300
You're so thoughtful.

486
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,300
It's fine. It's fine.

487
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,800
I just think that you're suffering so much here

488
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,500
And the Priestess said that you were heavily sick and moved out of Gan Lu Temple

489
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:51,436
During the journey over here, I was so worried!

490
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,000
Now that I see that you're well and healthy

491
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,300
I can be rest assured too.

492
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,615
I heard that you got promoted to be a Concubine.

493
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:03,600
I was so happy for many days!

494
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,300
What's the use of being a Concubine?

495
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,400
That doesn't matter to me

496
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,900
Why do you do that to yourself?

497
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,400
For these two years, it seems like His Majesty is punishing himself.

498
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,700
He only buries his head in Court affairs.

499
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,600
After you left,

500
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,300
His Majesty's attitude toward the harem has cooled a lot too.

501
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,000
Although there is also Concubine Qi,

502
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,100
and a Lingering Kang and Concubine Zhen

503
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,700
But it's hard for one to say that he really likes any one

504
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,900
Until just recently, Promise Ye entered the palace and things got a little bit better

505
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,300
Now His Majesty treats me courteously

506
00:32:40,703 --> 00:32:44,017
That's good too. <br>Now with the status of a Concubine,

507
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,300
it's easier to do some things too.

508
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,000
Fangruo Gugu being able to visit me frequently...

509
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,300
it's thanks to you asking Empress Dowager for permission?

510
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,500
You're doing so much for me.

511
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,200
If the situation were reversed, and I were the one suffering,

512
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
you would do the same for me.

513
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,900
Huan Er, I listened to you.

514
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,800
I kept my head down and out of the Empress' notice

515
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,400
I just spent my time dutifully serving the Empress Dowager

516
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,500
And helped Consort Jing look after Long Yue

517
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,000
Just so that the day will come when I can clear your name

518
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,600
But after so many years, I haven't been able to get anything useful

519
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:27,059
It's not easy to leave the palace, especially not at this time of the year

520
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:29,175
How were you able to come out?

521
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,800
A few days ago, Princess Wenyi fell sick.

522
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,700
Although the physician saw her,

523
00:33:34,753 --> 00:33:38,071
But the priestess at Bao Hua Temple said that there's a spiritual disturbance

524
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,600
So all the tablets of executed court ladies have to be moved to Gan Lu Temple

525
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,600
But to do this in the Zheng month (12th month) is inauspicious

526
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,800
Why was it handed to you?

527
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,100
The Priest said

528
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:54,000
It has to be done by a woman that hasn't been with the Emperor for a long time to perform such a peaceful task

529
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,600
Of course, I'm not the only woman who fits that criteria.

530
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,200
But the others found it taboo.

531
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,400
That's why I had the chance.

532
00:34:02,676 --> 00:34:05,063
You've always been circumspect about such matters

533
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:09,116
and would never get involved with these sort of spiritual things

534
00:34:09,877 --> 00:34:11,382
Sister Mei

535
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:14,239
Are you sure that you're only here to see me

536
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,600
as a convenient aside from that task?

537
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,600
Since you've discovered it, I won't keep it from you.

538
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,800
I had Physician Wen give Princess Wenyi some medicine to increase her temperature.

539
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:30,862
And then bribed the Priest from Bao Hua Temple to mention the cleansing of the spirits

540
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,700
That's how I got the opportunity to meet you.

541
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,400
You put in so much effort...

542
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,700
Something severe must have happened?

543
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,400
Has something happened to Longyue?

544
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,600
No, no. Not Longyue.

545
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,300
She's fine. Nothing's wrong with her at all.

546
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,500
It's...

547
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:52,400
Your father. He's fallen gravely ill in Ninggu Tower

548
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,400
Father was fine.

549
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,900
How could he be ill to the extent that it's life-threatening?

550
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,900
Yes. Although Uncle was exiled, his body has always been healthy.

551
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,600
I was hesitant for many days regarding telling you about it.

552
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,600
I was afraid that if you found out, <br>you'd just be upset over it.

553
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,100
But... after thinking it through,

554
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,700
I'm worried about Uncle's safety, <br>and could stop myself from telling you about it.

555
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,400
Father has always been healthy.

556
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,200
What on earth happened?

557
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,400
That's exactly where the problem lies.

558
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,500
If it is heaven's will then it is alright

559
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,700
If it is a human's will

560
00:35:31,703 --> 00:35:34,040
then it's really frightening

561
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,969
Jie Jie thinks

562
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:38,136
that some one was deliberately out to harm him?

563
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,682
I'm afraid that it may be from the Empress' camp.

564
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:45,247
Otherwise it's people from the Gua'er'jia clan

565
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,700
To think that even after so long,

566
00:35:47,703 --> 00:35:50,107
that they'll keep persisting without letting go

567
00:35:50,344 --> 00:35:52,712
Then Zhen clan has been imprisoned in Ni Gu Tower

568
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,900
I've even left the temple to come here

569
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,500
Why won't they let us off?

570
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,800
Huan Er, now is not the time to be sad.

571
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Uncle was targeted

572
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,600
Who knows whether the next target will be you?

573
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,600
You have to think of a way to get Uncle sent back to the capital to be treated.

574
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,500
With careful treatment, he may still be able to recover.

575
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,600
What you said is right.

576
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:17,624
At this point in time,

577
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,200
The most important are those who are alive.

578
00:36:21,173 --> 00:36:23,109
Regarding Father's treatment,

579
00:36:23,491 --> 00:36:25,158
I will do my best to think of a way.

580
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,500
Yes.

581
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,900
Niangniang, the time is up. <br>We must return to the palace before it gets dark.

582
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,200
Alright. I understand. Have the sedan waiting.

583
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,700
Yes, Niang'niang shouldn't miss the auspicious hour

584
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,400
Huan Er.

585
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,700
I'm leaving now.

586
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,000
Just remember one thing.

587
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,200
Take good care of yourself.

588
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,400
That's the most important thing, alright?

589
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,800
The palace is dangerous.

590
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
You have to be careful too.

591
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,400
When we'll meet again...

592
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,900
is anyone's guess.

593
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,200
As long as we're both safe and sound,

594
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,700
why does it matter whether or not we meet?

595
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,800
You must take care.

596
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,500
You as well.

597
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:44,788
<br>

598
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,300
Why hasn't mistress eaten dinner again?

599
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,400
Something happened to His Lordship. I'm very upset too.

600
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,100
I just hope His Lordship can return as soon as possible

601
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
So that he can help

602
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Mistress, what's wrong?

603
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,700
Did you eat something bad?

604
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,900
Could it be...?

605
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,200
Congratulations, Mistress.

606
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,700
It's not even been a month. Lower your volume.

607
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,000
Mistress, you should tell Grand Concubine. It'll make her happy.

608
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,500
Something just happened to my father.

609
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,400
I can't bring myself to be happy.

610
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,800
I'll wait for Yunli to return.

611
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,800
We'll tell Grand Concubine together then.

612
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,100
Huanbi.

613
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,900
The one in my womb is your little nephew.

614
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,100
Yurao and our parents are in Ning Gu Tower

615
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,800
I'm afraid for the rest of our lives, we can only rely on each other as sisters

616
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,500
My child is also your child

617
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,700
From now on we'll raise him together

618
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:21,389
Is that okay?

619
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,700
Is that really true?

620
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,700
Elder Sister and His Lordship's child

621
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,700
is also my child

622
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,100
Some things have already been decided, and can't be changed.

623
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,800
If there are changes, it would only hurt people

624
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,700
What I can give to you, I'll give it all to you.

625
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,500
I understand

626
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,500
Somethings that are not destined to be mine...

627
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,700
can't be forced.
