00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Episode 52

2
00:00:07,497 --> 00:00:09,266
Greetings to your highness

3
00:00:09,993 --> 00:00:11,601
and greetings to all sisters.

4
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:13,407
Rise

5
00:00:15,777 --> 00:00:18,567
You've been in the palace for a while, but I havn't met you once.

6
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:22,632
So I had to invite you over to hang with your sisters in the palace.

7
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:25,741
His majesty knows I am a loner and don't enjoy personal visits

8
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:28,385
So he conveniently exempted me from daily greeting visits

9
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:32,698
despite his majesty's considerateness, how can you delay your greetings to her highness the Empress.

10
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:34,857
She is the holder of the harum

11
00:00:34,857 --> 00:00:39,622
Heart felt respect is not necessarily represented by daily greetings

12
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:45,176
Not to mention that, of all the people sitting here, who knows who is speaking against her heart.

13
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:48,814
What do you mean by that?

14
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:53,221
Within the harem, who doesn't truly respect her highness

15
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:57,770
So what's true in the heart is what's said from the mouth?

16
00:00:58,874 --> 00:01:03,796
You! Look your highness, look at Attendant Ye! You are way out of line!

17
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:07,907
Can you tell any difference from this and the expelled Concubine Wan!

18
00:01:07,907 --> 00:01:12,915
May you blessed and healthy your highness. If you have no further instructions,,

19
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:14,716
Let's take it as I have greeted you.

20
00:01:14,716 --> 00:01:16,369
I'll excuse myself.

21
00:01:20,223 --> 00:01:23,333
Look! Look at her! She...

22
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,724
She? She did nothing wrong. What are you so annoyed about?

23
00:01:27,724 --> 00:01:32,801
There, there have never been such an in-obedient person in the harem.

24
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,265
Well there is now.

25
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,133
It's getting late today

26
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:38,660
You are all dismissed

27
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,052
Excuse me please.

28
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,547
Consort Qi, stay

29
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:47,356
Of course

30
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:04,842
Your highness, It used to be Concubine Wan that was spoiled.

31
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:07,278
And that was understandable. But what is this Attendant Ye?

32
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:10,103
A mere female slave born inferior

33
00:02:10,103 --> 00:02:13,286
How dare she shoucase any might in front of your highness

34
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:19,577
She WAS an inferior slave. But now she is his majesty's favourate

35
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:23,920
Should she gave birth to a prince and became noble because of her son

36
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,311
It would be most probable that

37
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:28,411
she will be bullying you and me

38
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:32,346
She? Not worthy enough to give birth to a prince

39
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:36,462
With the favor she is enjoying now, it's just a matter of time

40
00:02:36,462 --> 00:02:38,960
Concubine Qi said it right.

41
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,445
It would be great if she' was infertile

42
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:49,141
As favored as she could be, she will have nothing to bank on eventually

43
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:55,061
Last time you used the pollen of Nerium oleander,

44
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:58,484
intending for the miscarriage of Concubine Wan

45
00:02:58,484 --> 00:02:59,977
You still remember it?

46
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:02,353
Your highness, I

47
00:03:02,353 --> 00:03:07,188
I agreed to keep your secret, and I will keep to it

48
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:11,940
Comparing to killing a fetus with pollen

49
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,960
preventative control would be much easier,

50
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,831
wouldn't it?

51
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:26,368
Think about what I said. Not for me

52
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:29,812
It's for your 3rd Prince to not have any risk

53
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:41,608
All the fabric is newly rewarded to you by his majesty, Why don't you pick what you like to make new cloths? My mistress

54
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:45,263
Keep the green and blue ones,

55
00:03:45,263 --> 00:03:47,923
You guys can take whatever you like from the rest.

56
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:51,311
All your outfits are either green or blue, my mistress,

57
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:54,247
why not make some red or purple ones? They are pretty too.

58
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:55,760
I don't like them

59
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:10,789
Greetings, Attendant Ye.

60
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:14,975
Consort Qi ordered me to bring you some jujube soup

61
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,259
Do I have to drink it?

62
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,338
It's her highness's nice gesture

63
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,494
Go, tell your mistress you've done it

64
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:13,591
your highness, your highness

65
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:16,872
U scared me. What are you being so loud for?

66
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:18,573
Please forgive me, your highness, I didn't mean to.

67
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:25,539
Didn't I tell you to wait outside Chun Xi Chamber and see what happens？ Why are you back?

68
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:29,831
Attendant Ye is suffering from severe stomachache, his majesty decided on a thorough investigation

69
00:05:32,845 --> 00:05:35,314
Why would Attendant Ye suffer from such severe stomachache？

70
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:43,080
Your majesty, I discovered that Attendant Ye had taken something extremely cold (Chinese Medicine concept)

71
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,375
damaging her mothering body,

72
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:50,470
It's likely, very likely, that

73
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,900
What's the matter?

74
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,975
Your majesty, Attendant Ye is likely to

75
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:57,935
not be able to have children

76
00:05:57,935 --> 00:05:59,858
Who did it?

77
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:03,639
Why would she eat this thing so carelessly

78
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,230
That, I am not aware of.

79
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,628
All I know is that

80
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:12,446
The pain must have started right after she eats it.

81
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:15,277
Tell me!

82
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:18,544
What did she eat before the pain started?

83
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:24,170
Consort Qi ordered Cui Guo to bring some jujube soup, mistress started feeling unwell right after drinking it.

84
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,997
Consort Qi

85
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:32,128
Take Consort Qi to Chun Xi Chamber for me!

86
00:06:32,128 --> 00:06:33,581
Yes your majesty

87
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:35,923
Your majesty,

88
00:06:35,923 --> 00:06:38,485
Minister Zhang Tingyu requests to meet you.

89
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:45,645
- What's the matter? - He said the autumn flood in the south has destroyed dams, hundreds of thousands are homeless

90
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:48,055
- Where is he? - He is waiting at the Supreme Study Hall

91
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:50,877
Go to Yang Xin Chamber. Su Peisheng

92
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,862
Yes your majesty

93
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:56,947
Keep an eye on Consort Qi. I will let her explain

94
00:06:56,947 --> 00:06:58,773
what happened today.

95
00:07:02,316 --> 00:07:03,215
His majesty is going to Yang Xin Chamber

96
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:06,431
You really did that?

97
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:08,594
Yes

98
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,009
The physician told me,

99
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:16,973
Attendant Ye is infertile

100
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:22,336
That's a very clean cut you did. But his majesty is not stupid.

101
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:24,517
Your highness

102
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:27,468
I did it on your instructions

103
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:30,084
You must save me

104
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:31,559
On my instructions!

105
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:35,027
When did I ever instruct you to hurt people?

106
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:38,916
You made the call, you hurt the woman

107
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,561
If I would like to give you a pull, that's because I am merciful

108
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:45,696
If I couldn't, you just had asked for it

109
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:48,710
Your highness

110
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,946
Since your Pollen scheme

111
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:56,045
I have always protected you, lead you

112
00:07:56,254 --> 00:07:59,341
But a mother like you is really useless.

113
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:04,439
Your father Governor Li had been expelled by the late emperor for taking bribes

114
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:09,008
Even since then, you have been unable to protect your son

115
00:08:09,332 --> 00:08:12,030
If it weren't for my protection

116
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:18,328
You think your 3rd Prince could grow-up uneventfully?

117
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:23,190
Every time I ask you to do something, it's done stupidly.

118
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:28,698
When I knew that you were stupid enough to have Cui Guo send the soup, I knew there's no way to keep you.

119
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:38,454
- Your highness, I, I really... - Everyone knows you did what you did immediately

120
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:40,394
If I keep protecting you, it's gonna take me with you

121
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,431
And take 3rd Prince with you

122
00:08:44,852 --> 00:08:48,928
It's because he has a mother like you that he is not valued by his majesty

123
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:56,178
Tell me yourself, with what you have done, can you help 3rd Prince ascend the throne?

124
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:03,970
I am a useless mother

125
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:10,011
I am... Useless

126
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:12,881
With a mother like you, 3rd Prince will never become the Crown Prince.

127
00:09:12,881 --> 00:09:19,626
Now I give you 2 options, one, I report to his majesty that

128
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:23,743
you intended to hurt Concubine Wan's fetus, and poison Attendant Ye,

129
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:29,199
Then he will vent his anger on 3rd Prince. By then one of you will be executed,

130
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:31,987
the other will never touch the throne

131
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:34,383
No, no

132
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:38,478
2, you handle this yourself

133
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:42,981
I will help you fulfill 3rd, let him ascend the throne

134
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:46,391
What to do, is your pick

135
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:53,809
Your highness, your highness

136
00:09:55,187 --> 00:10:01,148
I can't die, I can't die

137
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:03,282
Please help me, help me! I have a child

138
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:05,249
Help me

139
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:09,879
You did every stupid thing possible, I cannot help you

140
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:15,825
Also, you don't need to think about fighting me, slander that I instigated you to do evil.

141
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:20,036
for one, his majesty won't believe you,

142
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:23,258
for another, with the Dowager, I will always be the irreplaceable Empress

143
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:28,805
You can only pray for your blessings

144
00:11:09,974 --> 00:11:13,633
3rd Prince, mother is leaving

145
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:18,866
make me proud

146
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:17,577
Consort Qi, why did you do this

147
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,680
An evil bitch like her,

148
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,696
letting her hang herself is too easy on her

149
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:29,846
Your majesty, Consort Qi was just making a wrong call

150
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:35,177
Your majesty, her funeral...

151
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:38,020
She hang herself in fear of guilt, and cannot be awarded better titles.

152
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:43,882
To avoid gossip, and considering 3rd Prince, I will not dig deeper.

153
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:51,178
She has served me for over 10 years. How could she be so messed up

154
00:12:51,178 --> 00:12:53,213
It's unvelievable

155
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:59,641
Your majesty, Consort Qi has served you for 21 years

156
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:06,228
Now that Qi died, although 3rd has grown up

157
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:08,470
he needs someone to look after him

158
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:11,981
I oversee the harem,

159
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:16,384
so I see any child in the harem as my child

160
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:21,523
And I have always fostered 3rd

161
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:25,736
I will take the responsibilities of a mother

162
00:13:25,736 --> 00:13:28,559
I feel much relieved hearing you say this

163
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:33,352
The Dowager is old, and suffering from illness,

164
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:38,072
You have always loved 3rd.

165
00:13:38,072 --> 00:13:39,957
It's the most suitable arrangement that you foster him

166
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,588
Yes

167
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:46,336
Greetings your highness

168
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:10,163
Take care of your body. Don't catch a cold

169
00:14:10,163 --> 00:14:14,013
Thanks. If you are just here to see me, you have seen me.

170
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:15,969
you can go back. now

171
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:19,158
I know you are heart broken

172
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,678
but there are plenty of excellent physicians in the palace.

173
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:24,982
You will have your own child.

174
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:28,522
Heart broken? Why would I be heart broken?

175
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:35,057
The reason you are visiting me, is because I am like your sister Concubine Wan,

176
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:36,682
We are both schemed. Right?

177
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:41,754
same, but different

178
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,995
It doesn't matter whether we are alike

179
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:47,839
just one life

180
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:54,412
All right, you take some rest. I shall not disturb you.

181
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:59,508
Even without the soup from Consort Qi, I would not want any kids

182
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:03,150
I'm just suspecting

183
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,190
The soup came in a strange way

184
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,816
Even my cat smelled the unusual scent.

185
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,231
Since she wants me dead so bad

186
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:15,987
I shall fulfill her wish

187
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:20,504
Whether it's infertilization medication or poison,

188
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:23,170
I don't care

189
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,861
You want to die so bad?

190
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:28,626
I was alone and free

191
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:32,172
Who knows I would be kept in this place where I can't see the sun

192
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:35,025
and live with a man I don't like at all

193
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:39,317
He took away any chance I might have had

194
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:40,756
what chance?

195
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:44,500
It's not important anymore

196
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:48,118
I'll see it as Qi giving me an end

197
00:15:49,294 --> 00:15:51,567
I don't want his child anyway

198
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:58,090
Don't say this to anyone

199
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,600
Mistress, Eunice Su is here

200
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:12,738
Greetings Concubine Hui, greetings Attendant Ye

201
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:16,043
Imperial Decree.

202
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:22,631
Second Class Female Attendant Ye has been unfairly treated. I feel for her.

203
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:29,096
I hereby promote Second Class Female Attendant Ye to Noble Lady, with the title of Ning.

204
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:31,960
End of Decree

205
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,999
Thank you your majesty

206
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:38,892
Congratulations Noble Lady Ning

207
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:48,773
This way please Minister Wen

208
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:51,770
- Here you are. - This is the new pregnancy medication I prepared for you

209
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,105
Use it for now

210
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:56,351
Have you not rested well recently? You look tired.

211
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,601
Prince said he would be back in 40 days

212
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:05,360
It's been 50, and we havn't heard from him

213
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,414
Miss is surely anxious. Last night she had nightmares and didn't sleep well,

214
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:11,680
So she doesn't look too good

215
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,762
Nightmares are not to believe.

216
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:17,007
He should be back soon

217
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:26,825
- He won't. - What do you say? - Prince Guo won't be back.

218
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:28,848
He's dead

219
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,075
Minister Wen, you...

220
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:37,266
What are you talking about?

221
00:17:38,314 --> 00:17:40,488
How can you curse him like this?

222
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:42,080
He's the father of my child

223
00:17:43,182 --> 00:17:47,049
Huan, when have I ever lied to you?

224
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:49,950
Prince Guo went to Yunnan and Tibet, and hasn't come back in time,

225
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,667
There has been no information about him in the Court

226
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:55,180
His majesty ordered a search mission

227
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,246
and learnt that the ship he took sank

228
00:17:58,246 --> 00:18:00,002
Not even a body was recovered

229
00:18:00,002 --> 00:18:02,132
Miss

230
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:07,290
Huan, the Yellow River is so fierce,

231
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,232
It broke the steel ship into fragments

232
00:18:09,232 --> 00:18:11,221
Even the body was recovered

233
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,971
It wouldn't have been recognisable

234
00:18:17,986 --> 00:18:23,954
You are lying, you are lying, you are lying

235
00:18:23,954 --> 00:18:29,153
I'm not lying. I swear with our friendship. I'm not lying

236
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,915
He's dead

237
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,107
I can't even see him for one last time

238
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:48,521
Huan, clear your mind, dead is dead

239
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:51,834
dead is dead

240
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:55,583
Not even his spirit came to my dream

241
00:18:55,583 --> 00:19:02,465
- Huan - What can we do about this, miss, miss

242
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:03,661
- Huan - Miss

243
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,562
Why would he die, out of no where

244
00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:16,891
why wouldn't even his body be recovereable

245
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:20,419
Actually they found the wreckage of the ship he took

246
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:23,371
There is nothing wrong with it, but

247
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,833
but what

248
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:29,027
but the fuselage isn't mounted by steel nails,

249
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:32,811
but tied together with glue and robe.

250
00:19:32,811 --> 00:19:37,916
Once the ship travels in the water, the glue and robe would break, and the ship would sink.

251
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:43,508
The ship was sent by the government

252
00:19:43,508 --> 00:19:46,516
It shouldn't be like that

253
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:53,403
True. There wasn't a problem with the ship on the way there. According to the ship builders,

254
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:57,696
Although the ship looked similar to what they built,

255
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,218
the bottom of the ship was different

256
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:03,253
So it's evident that when the ship was parked, it was replaced.

257
00:20:05,848 --> 00:20:07,875
Who did this? Who did this?

258
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,279
Who did this?

259
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:13,447
- miss - who did this, who did this - miss, miss

260
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:17,127
Huan, what happened happened. We don't know who did this

261
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:21,486
before we find the body, his majesty wants to keep this a secret

262
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:26,622
- I don't believe it, I don't believe it. He won't die! -Miss - I don't believe it, don'tbelieve it

263
00:20:28,954 --> 00:20:36,082
Minister Wen, please stop. Miss is pregnant, telling her this is killing her.

264
00:20:36,082 --> 00:20:41,393
Aren't you always considerate like her brother? Why are you being silly now?

265
00:20:41,393 --> 00:20:45,666
I don't want to see her wait so miserably for someone never coming back

266
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:53,305
Huan, I know you are sad, but you have to mqake considerations for things now

267
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:59,670
If you still decides to have this child, I will give you the relive-after-death pill

268
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,639
And Jin Xi will report your death,

269
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:06,292
I will take you away from here, and find a quiet place to start a life

270
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:12,588
Trust me, I will take good care of you. I'll take care of your child like mine own

271
00:21:12,588 --> 00:21:14,922
Whatever Prince Guo can do, I can do it too.

272
00:21:14,922 --> 00:21:19,870
Minister Wen, whatever you say now, she won't hear it.

273
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,472
Why don't you wait until she calms down.

274
00:21:22,472 --> 00:21:25,305
Minister Wen

275
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:29,282
How could you treat Prince's child like your own?

276
00:21:29,282 --> 00:21:33,124
How could you do what he can?

277
00:21:37,105 --> 00:21:39,334
How can you compare with him!

278
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,200
I just want to see him everyday

279
00:21:45,675 --> 00:21:48,001
I just want to see him smile everyday

280
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:52,860
No, even occasionally is enough

281
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,255
Even his smile isn't for me

282
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:02,727
I will be content.

283
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
But he has dies now

284
00:22:09,324 --> 00:22:13,016
From now on, in my life

285
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,612
I will never see him again

286
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:20,857
I don't believe it

287
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,600
It's impossible

288
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,100
It's impossible

289
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:39,708
It's impossible

290
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,820
Miss, you are up.

291
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:53,779
you have slept for hours,

292
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:02,351
you havn't eaten for quite a while

293
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:05,578
why not drink the porridge while it's warm

294
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,630
Doctor Wen said

295
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:19,259
Your were to excited, and it had affected your pregnancy

296
00:23:19,302 --> 00:23:21,458
You cannot keep being sad

297
00:23:23,004 --> 00:23:25,095
It's important to keep healthy

298
00:23:27,346 --> 00:23:30,304
Can, can I feed you?

299
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:49,345
The dream still clear,

300
00:23:49,378 --> 00:23:52,660
things in the past have become less recognizable, in the spring blossoms and autumn moon.

301
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:58,314
Like looking at a flower through the fog, like watching the moon from the water

302
00:23:58,379 --> 00:24:02,511
It floats back and forth

303
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,200
You came, with your voice; you left, quietly

304
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,200
It's never been predictable

305
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,000
Although in love, although in sync

306
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,792
We got it, and we lost it

307
00:24:21,514 --> 00:24:26,259
There's a poem to be matched with, there's a song to be responded to

308
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:30,245
There are two hearts to be tied together

309
00:24:30,287 --> 00:24:34,305
Hoping for eternal love, hoping for eternal matrimony

310
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,500
But all I have left is the violin and the flute

311
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:43,403
We had the connection with our love, we had the commitment with our heart

312
00:24:43,443 --> 00:24:48,237
We leaned on each other with our bodies

313
00:24:48,608 --> 00:24:52,731
Don't forget me, don't betray me

314
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:57,442
But what about hatred and deceit

315
00:24:57,853 --> 00:25:01,735
What I got, I don't want, What I want, I don't get

316
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,600
Fate is mock using

317
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,600
Destiny is playing us. My heartly love,

318
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:15,674
finally flew away with falling blossoms.

319
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,800
Looking forward to a bright moon, looking forward to the morning sun,

320
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:26,180
I look forward to the breeze in the spring.

321
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:32,382
But the wind is vicious, bringing rain and snow with it

322
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:35,333
It damaged the plum blossoms, and broke the tree branch

323
00:25:36,781 --> 00:25:41,471
The phoenix is about to fly. It makes sound with it's feather

324
00:25:41,503 --> 00:25:44,859
It left, far, without any trace.

325
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:49,985
Listening to the rain, dropping on the sycamore tree

326
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:54,533
My memory sways with the wind

327
00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:59,936
Listening to the rain, dropping on the sycamore tree

328
00:25:59,982 --> 00:26:05,744
My memory sways with the wind

329
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,300
Greetings to my imperial mother from your son Hong Shi

330
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:16,977
Jian Qiu, help 3rd Prince up.

331
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,322
Yes. 3rd Prince

332
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Now, you should call me mother instead.

333
00:26:25,157 --> 00:26:26,085
Yes

334
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:31,635
From now on, I am your nother

335
00:26:31,635 --> 00:26:33,834
Although I'm not your birth mother,

336
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:37,523
the mother-son relationship we have is something worth celebrating

337
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,481
I look forward to it being a great and eternal one.

338
00:26:43,405 --> 00:26:46,013
I promise to be a good son with my full heart , my imperial mother

339
00:26:47,031 --> 00:26:48,734
I mean mother

340
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:51,124
That's good

341
00:26:52,073 --> 00:26:54,528
Consort Qi has served his majesty for 21 years

342
00:26:54,825 --> 00:26:57,444
I saw her enter the Prince's Mansion as a princess,

343
00:26:58,448 --> 00:27:01,283
become the vice mistress after having you

344
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,400
and got conferred the title of Consort after the coronationa

345
00:27:05,295 --> 00:27:08,005
Now she committed such a big mistake

346
00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:12,632
but in the end, she left heir for the imperial family.

347
00:27:13,573 --> 00:27:15,410
That's a big credit for her

348
00:27:16,565 --> 00:27:18,653
Now she ended up miserablly

349
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:20,864
Although his majesty isn't happy about it,

350
00:27:21,964 --> 00:27:25,044
I'm going to order guards for her grave palace

351
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:26,895
as we have been sisters for years,

352
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:28,574
serving his majesty

353
00:27:29,752 --> 00:27:33,005
and that she also had you

354
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,900
Hope she can rest in peace

355
00:27:37,878 --> 00:27:40,684
I am beyond grateful for your forgiveness, mother,

356
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:43,530
Your highness, please don't be sad

357
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:47,047
You have been heart broken for days

358
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:48,454
for Consort Qi

359
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,809
How that 3rd Prince gets taken care of by you

360
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:52,727
she will rest in peace

361
00:27:53,836 --> 00:27:55,389
It makes everyone sad

362
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:57,043
if you keep being so heart broken

363
00:27:57,088 --> 00:27:58,889
That sounds reasonable,

364
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:04,945
but Qi and I served his majesty for so many years together

365
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:07,882
There is no way her sudden departure

366
00:28:08,597 --> 00:28:11,458
won't break my heart

367
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,922
She made such a bad call

368
00:28:20,295 --> 00:28:21,610
Mother

369
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:25,056
My late birth mother had un-erasable guilt when she was alive

370
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:27,093
I promise to work harder int he future

371
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:28,832
and help father with his worries

372
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,165
So I won't waste all the time father and you spent on me

373
00:28:33,594 --> 00:28:36,359
Good, good

374
00:28:37,489 --> 00:28:39,285
You are a good kid

375
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:41,522
you are my good kid

376
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,686
What's the matter? Seems like you have some worries

377
00:28:57,004 --> 00:28:58,771
Is t because you think I havn't

378
00:28:58,793 --> 00:29:00,564
been taking care of Concubine Wan recently?

379
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,737
Not having Fang Ruo visit her

380
00:29:03,526 --> 00:29:06,506
I'm just worried about your health your highness

381
00:29:10,164 --> 00:29:12,324
Once old, you are useless

382
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,389
Always having health problems

383
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,403
Right now, the are people brave enough to

384
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:20,295
do despicable things under my watch

385
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:23,498
Once I die

386
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:26,461
I'll never be able to protect you guys

387
00:29:30,323 --> 00:29:32,205
I am guilty of execution for making your highness feel sad

388
00:29:36,852 --> 00:29:40,043
Take it easy. As long as I am alive

389
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:42,348
I will protect you

390
00:29:43,127 --> 00:29:44,466
Get up

391
00:29:45,428 --> 00:29:46,814
Thanks your highness

392
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:51,169
Although Fang Ruo hasn't been out visiting Concubine Wan

393
00:29:52,093 --> 00:29:54,258
But I assme the nuns at the temple

394
00:29:54,554 --> 00:29:56,217
won't dare to do anything obserd

395
00:29:58,141 --> 00:30:00,267
Her highness the Empress has arrived

396
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,714
Listen, what a big presentation

397
00:30:14,845 --> 00:30:16,184
May you all good imperial mother

398
00:30:16,212 --> 00:30:17,628
No

399
00:30:17,662 --> 00:30:19,809
it's good enough that you are all good

400
00:30:20,408 --> 00:30:23,720
The impress need not to worry about whether the old lady is all good

401
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:30,555
Now that your highness has taken the medicine, I will excuse myself.

402
00:30:35,304 --> 00:30:39,199
Imperial mother, that's harsh, I feel scared and uneasy.

403
00:30:40,101 --> 00:30:44,351
You are scared? I should be scared

404
00:30:45,355 --> 00:30:48,028
You forced Qi to die with such a good scheme

405
00:30:48,111 --> 00:30:50,526
and took 3rd as your own son

406
00:30:50,555 --> 00:30:52,487
What a clean cut

407
00:30:54,322 --> 00:30:55,979
Please, imperial mother

408
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,619
I havn't done that

409
00:30:58,186 --> 00:31:01,908
Dare you say Qi's death wasn't for you?

410
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:05,238
If you say it like this

411
00:31:05,286 --> 00:31:07,429
I cannot really debate it

412
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:09,325
Of course not

413
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:12,681
so you have no witness

414
00:31:12,732 --> 00:31:14,402
You killed Qi's Cui Guo, pushing her into the lotus pool

415
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,984
What you don't know is

416
00:31:18,395 --> 00:31:20,228
that Cui Guo had come to me

417
00:31:20,314 --> 00:31:21,968
and told me everything

418
00:31:21,991 --> 00:31:23,796
in fear of getting involved.

419
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:27,084
But Cui Guo was indeed not killed by me

420
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,593
Anyway, it's not the first time

421
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:32,937
that you do evil

422
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:37,736
The death of your dear sister, Impress Chun Yuan

423
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:39,641
You know about it better than I do

424
00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:45,196
Now that you are aware of this

425
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:48,482
you should also be aware that

426
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:50,331
all I did was for the family of Uranara

427
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:53,791
You should know better than I that

428
00:31:54,543 --> 00:31:56,126
with a soft temper like my sister's

429
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:58,289
she could not have ruled the harem at all

430
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,000
Not to mention suppressing concubines and balancing interests

431
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:05,017
Only I can do that

432
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,972
Good, you can take responsibility for what you did

433
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,800
Counting the miscarriages of

434
00:32:13,843 --> 00:32:15,702
Noble ladies Xin and Fucha

435
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,189
There are quite some lost lives under your belt

436
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,900
Isn't that enough?

437
00:32:20,577 --> 00:32:23,691
Fucha used her pregnancy to get favor in multiple occasions

438
00:32:23,743 --> 00:32:26,024
she didn't deserve to give birth to a prince

439
00:32:26,722 --> 00:32:28,139
If your child was still alive

440
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,394
For the emperor's favor, you will do the same with your child

441
00:32:34,738 --> 00:32:38,371
I am a cursed person, with my 1st Prince died early

442
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,500
But I know

443
00:32:40,604 --> 00:32:42,903
that neither Uya nor Uranara are significant families

444
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:48,093
It took you so much effort to become the Dowager

445
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:51,989
and you could make me the Empress to further the glory of the family

446
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,670
I did everything with care

447
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,782
to prolong the power of our family

448
00:32:58,573 --> 00:33:00,984
I did nothing wrong

449
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,533
Of course you did nothing wrong

450
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:07,541
I've never been an Empress

451
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,463
I only became the Empress Dowager after the late Emperor died

452
00:33:12,343 --> 00:33:13,683
So as soon as the Emperor ascended the throne

453
00:33:13,738 --> 00:33:15,770
I made you the Empress

454
00:33:16,498 --> 00:33:18,188
To ensure the Harem Throne

455
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:20,619
is in the hands of our own people

456
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:24,166
So I pretended not to see

457
00:33:24,226 --> 00:33:26,130
many of your wrongdoings

458
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:28,783
But those in the wombs of the concubines

459
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,719
are my very own grandchildren

460
00:33:30,804 --> 00:33:32,779
I love them more

461
00:33:34,536 --> 00:33:36,886
No matter whose son ascends the throne

462
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:40,625
you will always be the Noble Empress Dowager

463
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,400
Why did you need to kill the mother and take the child

464
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,000
being so cruel?

465
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,800
How could there be two Empress Dowagers in the harem

466
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,100
If I have to fight and get rid of her at that time,

467
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,600
it's not as convenient as it is now.

468
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,300
Yes I am guilty

469
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,000
But I have the whole Uranara family in my mind

470
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,200
Do you think

471
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,200
there is anyone capable of the Harem Throne?

472
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:12,392
I am the only candidate

473
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,200
And I am the only

474
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,400
Empress that mothers the whole nation

475
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,500
So as much as you are angry Imperial Mother

476
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,100
You can't not support me

477
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:26,995
which is supporting yourself

478
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Great, great

479
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,300
Now you are the one and only in the harem.

480
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:40,800
That I have to pay tribute to the teaching and protection from you, my imperial mother

481
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,800
I am beyond grateful. You have been unwell for a long time. There is really not much need to worry about me.

482
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,300
It's more important to focus on recovering from the illness

483
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,700
So his majesty won't suspect

484
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,900
that your illness

485
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,200
has to do with Long Keduo

486
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,000
Truly, you are more and more like an Empress

487
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,300
I do hope you can hold on to this throne

488
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,700
But I need to tell you

489
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,100
you need to leave some space, either as a person, or in handling youraffairs

490
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,400
Killing everyone will cut your own options

491
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,200
Thanks for your teaching imperial mother

492
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,900
With you leading by example, I will surely be a student better than the teacher

493
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,700
You can just relax

494
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,500
If there's nothing else, I'll excuse myself for now

495
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,100
Zhu Xi

496
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,600
look, this is the kid I taught personally

497
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,300
Chun Yuan was too soft-hearted

498
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,300
Yi Xiu is too hard-hearted

499
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,500
I

500
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,800
Your highness, you need to take care of your health

501
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,500
It's not that I don't look after my health

502
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm just afraid that if Yi Xiu keeps doing what she is doing

503
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,300
Uranara and Uya families

504
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,900
will end in her hands

505
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,900
Of course I want the Empress of the Dynasty

506
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,500
is always from my family

507
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,500
But if there is no one to balance her out in the harem,

508
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,600
Her vice will kill herself

509
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,900
and kill all heir of Ashinjero

510
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,800
Where have you been miss

511
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,000
you havn't eaten anything in 3 whole days

512
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,900
even an iron man can't survive this

513
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,300
If you don't want to eat

514
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,500
just drink the medicine

515
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,000
It's what I begged Doctor Wen

516
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,300
to prepare for you

517
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,800
It has blah blah blah blah

518
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,000
blah blah blah blah

519
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,600
They are all good for clearing clots (fetus)

520
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,600
If you drink it, there will no know trouble from your womb

521
00:37:58,304 --> 00:38:01,646
You aren't keeping it anyway

522
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,409
since you aren't eating or drinking anything

523
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Why not drink it so that the poor baby can go earlier

524
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,600
and doesn't have to live through the miseries with you

525
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,800
It's very strong medicine

526
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,600
There's no way back after you take it

527
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,000
It won't hurt too much

528
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,400
you know about Dr Wen's skills

529
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,000
Please take it, miss

530
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,980
Sister, you cannot take this

531
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,800
You need to keep this child

532
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,000
it's the only child of Prince

533
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,100
You can't not have it

534
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,100
Jin Xi

535
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:03,500
I won't take the medicine

536
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,100
I will keep this child

537
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,900
Not only this child

538
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,800
but my family

539
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,100
Yun Li is dead

540
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,100
There is no one that can protect me like he did

541
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,100
I need to learn to protect myself

542
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,200
and those I need to protect

543
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,200
miss, this is the Zhen Huan I know

544
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,800
I cannot die

545
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,500
For this child

546
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,900
for my parents, my family

547
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,800
for Yun Li who died innocently

548
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,600
I'll live

549
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,200
I'll live well
