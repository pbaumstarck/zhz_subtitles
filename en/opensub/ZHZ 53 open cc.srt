1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,700
ma'am

2
00:00:04,774 --> 00:00:08,051
have you listened about doctor Wen's persuading words

3
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:11,334
if you listen to Doctor Wen word, living with him peacefully for whole life

4
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,654
it is also good though.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,729
Jin Xi, you are the person who know me best.

6
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:20,174
so why you come to test me now?

7
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:24,573
I won't be with him.

8
00:00:25,415 --> 00:00:28,614
Father is severely ill, and locked up at Ningguta.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,712
The Zhen clan has no one to look after them.

10
00:00:32,942 --> 00:00:38,051
What Yunli could help me with in the past, I have to shoulder it on my own now.

11
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:41,784
Wen Shichu can't help me.

12
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:44,858
I can only rely on myself.

13
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:50,657
Alright. Since you have made up your mind, you won't be alone.

14
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:54,135
Your servant and Huanbi will follow you, Mistress.

15
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:58,298
What will you do, Mistress?

16
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:02,597
Yunli's death is very suspicious. <br>I cannot ignore it.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,100
Before he left for Dianzang, he told me...

18
00:01:07,177 --> 00:01:11,867
The rebellion from Zhange-er tribe is not ease yet.There are a lot of spies sneak into Dianzang.

19
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:16,703
His accident was caused either by rebellion from Dainzang people

20
00:01:17,097 --> 00:01:20,497
Or the spies from Zhange-er tribe is unkown.

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,900
Perhaps...it may even have something to do with the people in the palace.

22
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:29,384
Regardless of which cause it is,

23
00:01:29,794 --> 00:01:33,497
just based on my own efforts,<br>it's impossible for me to avenge him.

24
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:38,658
The child I am carrying...

25
00:01:39,658 --> 00:01:41,977
I must be responsible for.

26
00:01:43,177 --> 00:01:46,666
I can't let his bloodline die.

27
00:01:48,503 --> 00:01:54,265
I must give this child an honorable name

28
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,300
And have the child grow up well

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,900
Also my father

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,400
Before I was careful to only protect my family

31
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:09,366
But recently my father has been sick

32
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:12,175
I can't just stand still and watch him

33
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:15,326
Mistress, if you want to do these things,

34
00:02:15,378 --> 00:02:19,373
In this world, only one person can help you.

35
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:22,888
That is right...

36
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:27,927
Yunli has told me before

37
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:34,763
The emperor has spoken my name in his dream

38
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,900
I am not 100% confident

39
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,566
But I'm must work hard on something

40
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:46,644
The emperor's hand...

41
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,600
Everything of the emperors, I must use to revenge

42
00:02:51,183 --> 00:02:52,382
Mistress

43
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:55,862
This step is dangerous and risky.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,400
Have you thought about it clearly?

45
00:02:59,462 --> 00:03:01,069
Do I have a choice?

46
00:03:02,742 --> 00:03:04,275
Yunli is dead.

47
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:10,798
With my current status what do I have to lose?

48
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:12,742
Mistress, are you saying that...

49
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:15,302
You plan resolve and gain the Emperor's love?

50
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:19,263
If Mistress and the Emperor can meet

51
00:03:19,302 --> 00:03:21,219
But I'm afraid we won't be able to cover up one thing.

52
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:25,425
If the palace becomes alerted, some people will want to kill.

53
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:28,989
If that's the case, then all we can do is wait (Chinese idiom meaning waiting for death)

54
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:35,151
Let's return to the palace.

55
00:03:56,992 --> 00:03:58,150
Dr. Wen

56
00:03:59,062 --> 00:03:59,909
Huan'er

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,700
I look ugly don't I?

58
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:06,160
How can you say that?

59
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,941
Recently, you just haven't had enough air.

60
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,100
So your face is a bit pale.

61
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,700
I'm pregnant, so low blood concentration is not good for me.

62
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:20,019
So please prescribed me some medicine that would refuel the blood for me. And

63
00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:23,581
Do you still have goddess powder (medicine) from previously?

64
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:28,060
What makes you think of that since everything is fine.

65
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:32,699
Mistress insist to give the birth to the child, but she does not look very well.

66
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,621
So the child will probably don't look well,too.

67
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:40,662
Therefore, she needs to eat some healthy food for the blood plus the goddess powder (medicine).

68
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,500
It would be best if you just treat yourself better.

69
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:49,222
As for the healthy food that refuel the blood, they need to have effect as soon as possible.

70
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,600
I hate seeing myself sick like this.

71
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:53,022
Alright

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,500
I will prescribed everyday use to Jinxi, you have to take good care of yourself.

73
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,000
Let me take your pulse.

74
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:19,532
Your pulse is gentle, and seemingly normal

75
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:23,141
Huan-er, you have to be careful, don't be very emotional.

76
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:27,694
I must go back now.

77
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,400
I will send the medicine as soon as possible,

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,200
Jin Xi

79
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:33,575
Please send Dr. Wen out.

80
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,935
Yes. Please Dr. Wen

81
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,200
Don't tell anyone about my return to the palace

82
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:46,459
Yes

83
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,813
It is very fragrant.

84
00:06:14,612 --> 00:06:16,980
Emperor, are you teasing me?

85
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,575
Can I not compliment you?

86
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,297
The Emperor is at YeXi palace.

87
00:06:34,297 --> 00:06:36,978
Yes. After the Emperor felt better,

88
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:39,412
He went to YeXi Palace and ChunXi Manor

89
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:43,565
I'm not worry about Precious Ning, but An ping...

90
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:47,942
An Ping seems to be docile, but it is hard to know what she is thinking.

91
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,300
I won't let her get pregnant, what other methods would she have...

92
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,000
Tell Hui Chun

93
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,300
She must watch An Ping have her non-pregnancy medicine or else there will be consequences

94
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,400
Yes.

95
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,900
Bao Juan

96
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:23,492
Hurry and dump this.

97
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:24,384
Yes

98
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,800
Jin Xi, Is there anyone in the palace,

99
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,300
Who can speak with the Emperor?

100
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,300
The only who can speak to the Emperor is Su Pei Sheng

101
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:43,661
He has serve the Emperor since he was small, so he understands him the best.

102
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:46,622
If Mistress wants to return to the palace,

103
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:50,429
You must encounter the Emperor to have a chance

104
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:54,143
But now were are outside of the Palace

105
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:59,103
There is nothing that I have that can be of use

106
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,434
You are wrong Mistress.

107
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:06,069
Su Pei Sheng, has always been with the Emperor so he hasn't seen much.

108
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:10,126
To buy Su Pei Sheng, it isn't money and power

109
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:11,662
Then?

110
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:16,062
Su Pei Sheng is one of the most miserable person because he cannot marry a wife and have children.

111
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:18,900
It is the worst thing of all.

112
00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:29,309
Consider it as them comforting each other in their sufferings.

113
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,823
It's better than nothing.

114
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:31,903
JIn Xi

115
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:34,501
I won't let you sacrifice yourself for me.

116
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:37,145
This is the best plan.

117
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:39,823
I and Su Pei Sheng are from the same village.

118
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,100
When I entered the palace,

119
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,100
Su Pei Sheng took care of me.

120
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,396
Plus we have been in the palace for so many years

121
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:51,461
Su Pei Sheng has been faithful only to me.

122
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:53,938
I am willing to try at least.

123
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:54,989
Jin Xi.

124
00:08:55,063 --> 00:08:58,432
You have been suffering with me compare to others

125
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,600
Because of me, you are willing to be with a Eunuch

126
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,100
Even if it takes a long time

127
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:06,725
But he isn't even a man

128
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:07,468
Mistress

129
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:11,143
I've already thought about this path already

130
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,700
Even if you try, it's no use

131
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,200
I'm willing to do anything for you.

132
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:24,813
About the future, we won't know if we don't gamble.

133
00:09:24,902 --> 00:09:31,764
What if my fate is to depend on Su Pei Sheng

134
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:37,583
I will go and get ready

135
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:41,622
Where are you going?

136
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Su Pei Sheng has a private house outside the palace, I know where it is.

137
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:49,792
That will let me meet up with him.

138
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:53,929
Jinxi, you don't have to do this for me.

139
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,700
There is other ways.

140
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,200
This is the best option

141
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,532
Beside, if you return you will have Su Pei Sheng support

142
00:10:02,556 --> 00:10:05,575
If one day you really gain the attention and love

143
00:10:05,691 --> 00:10:07,653
It will only be a good thing for Su Pei Sheng

144
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:13,090
And with my weak efforts,

145
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:15,778
we will have assurance.

146
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,578
Mistress, please rest assure

147
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,100
Jin Xi, it's you

148
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,700
Men...

149
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,800
Exchange the tea set with the Emperor's new one.

150
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,400
Drink my tea first

151
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:47,798
Thank you Eunuch Su

152
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:51,671
At my house you don't have to be so formal, just say my name.

153
00:10:52,238 --> 00:10:53,182
Pei Sheng

154
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,700
Sit down

155
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,600
The house has been re-design, how have you been living?

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's ok. It's just lonely with just myself living her.

157
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:09,734
It's been so many years, I'm use to it.

158
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,000
I came here to be with you

159
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,800
Although I'm a bit late.

160
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:29,390
What? You are now willing?

161
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,300
You must be tired. Your legs must hurt.

162
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,400
Actually, matters of this world are full of twists and turns like this.

163
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:45,260
The person who is beside me

164
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:48,262
I should be with that person.

165
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,600
But what a pity with Wan Ping

166
00:11:53,152 --> 00:11:55,660
Ever since she has been alone, no one is there to take care of her.

167
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,823
It's hard to hold it in.

168
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,100
Are you talking about Concubine Wan and Emperor?

169
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,425
Are you sure?

170
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:15,742
If Concubine Wan still has a chance, then wouldn't it be best for both?

171
00:12:18,463 --> 00:12:20,943
Right now at Emperor's side,

172
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:22,845
he's still missing a diligent person

173
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,200
In the palace Huang Hou is the highest and biggest

174
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,000
If Wan Ping enters the palace, I'm afraid it would be difficult

175
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:36,140
Whether it's difficult or not. It's all depending on the people.

176
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:37,968
As long as she works hard, then it will be fine

177
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:42,404
One day, if the Emperor

178
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:45,102
Can be with Wan Ping...

179
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,600
Then you and I would be a couple.

180
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,700
You have return.

181
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,300
Eunuch Su

182
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,100
I greet you, Niang Niang

183
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Please rise and sit.

184
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:16,039
Thank you. - Huang Bi, please serve the tea

185
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:17,290
Yes. - Sit down

186
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,400
I'm no longer a Niang Niang. You don't have to call me that.

187
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,100
For me to call you that,

188
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,517
It is my honor

189
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,741
I don't understand what you mean.

190
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:36,556
The other day, Jin Xi came to look for me

191
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,600
Although she didn't say much, I am able to guess it.

192
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,500
Seeing Niang Niang today, even though you live in a Buddhist abode, you still are radiant.

193
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,800
This lets me have a better understanding.

194
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,748
Then what is your purpose that you have come for?

195
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:54,740
I am here to congratulate you,

196
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:58,224
congratulations on your wish being granted.

197
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:01,384
Please continue speaking

198
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,700
Niang Niang, I've been with the Emperor for many years.

199
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,900
What ever the Emperors wants, he would receive it

200
00:14:11,023 --> 00:14:14,988
If back then you were willing to bow down

201
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,700
He wouldn't have let you leave the palace

202
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:24,744
Lets no longer talk about the past.

203
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:27,665
So do you mean...

204
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:30,100
I insisted in leaving the palace...

205
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,067
However, my family has offend the Emperor

206
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:35,264
How can I face the Emperor...

207
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:40,106
Ever since I left the Palace, I've missed the Emperor

208
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Please relay my feelings to his Highness.

209
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,600
Yes

210
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,000
Niang Niang, that year you were ordered by the Emperor to Gan Lu Si to practice Buddhism.

211
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:52,021
Today you are here.

212
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,000
I understand that you suffered at Gan Lu Si.

213
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,300
In this wild,

214
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,400
You have suffered, Niang Niang

215
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:06,260
Actually there suffering is nothing to be afraid of, excepting not being at peace

216
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:11,901
If by living this way, I can have the opportunity to see the Emperor and the princess again

217
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:14,260
then I could die content.

218
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:22,540
I am indebted to you for your kindness to me in the past.

219
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,420
I will try my best.

220
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:27,461
Please rise

221
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,000
Life is always changing. I'm just afraid that the Emperor already has someone new by his side.

222
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,700
He has already forgotten about me.

223
00:15:35,824 --> 00:15:42,063
Niang Niang exaggerates. If I didn't have some certainty, I wouldn't have dared to come see you so quickly.

224
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,700
So Gong Gong already has a plan?

225
00:15:46,908 --> 00:15:52,070
Ever since you have left, the emperor has been missing you.

226
00:15:52,424 --> 00:15:57,900
Because of his position, he cannot come save you.

227
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,600
Niangniang, you are wise. <br>You would understand.

228
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:04,060
If not for His Majesty's silent consent,

229
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,980
Empress Dowager's approval would not have been enough<br> for Fangruo to keep visiting you, Niangniang.

230
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,500
When His Majesty was seriously ill, <br>he has never called for anyone other than Empress Chunyuan.

231
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:18,541
You're the first, Niangniang.

232
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,700
That day the Empress Dowager was present too. <br>It gave her a shock!

233
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:26,103
This is the lingering feeling that His Majesty has for you, Niangniang.

234
00:16:26,103 --> 00:16:28,660
It's an extremely important lingering feeling too!

235
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:33,186
To tell you the truth, <br>Prince Guo was present then too.

236
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:35,663
He heard His Majesty too.

237
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:38,823
It's a pity that the Prince won't be coming back anymore.

238
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,061
Why won't he be coming back?

239
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:45,583
This is supposed to be a secret in the palace. <br>I'm not supposed to say anything.

240
00:16:46,824 --> 00:16:49,705
His Majesty's intention is for the mourning to be done in secret.

241
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,200
It's a pity.

242
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,400
Prince Guo's life has just come to an end so suddenly.

243
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:02,813
Niangniang, you must be tired. <br>Have a glass of water first.

244
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,100
Wang Ye was so young, such a pity.

245
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:11,326
Isn't it?

246
00:17:11,343 --> 00:17:14,425
Why are we talking about other people?

247
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,200
Actually, it's not impossible for you to meet His Majesty.

248
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,700
I tried me best to convince the Emperor to come to Gan Lu Si to worship

249
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:30,583
and I will lead him to here.

250
00:17:30,945 --> 00:17:32,304
It's been hard on you, Gonggong.

251
00:17:32,348 --> 00:17:36,124
This matter is not easy to handle.

252
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:38,621
Gonggong, please make the effort.

253
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:41,102
It's not that difficult.

254
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:43,469
Allow me to think of some way.

255
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,384
Eunuch Su

256
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:50,145
I really don't know how to repay your kindness

257
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:54,341
Ma'am, by helping you

258
00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:56,303
I am also helping myself

259
00:18:02,663 --> 00:18:05,950
If anything happens I have someone report it to you.

260
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,900
Then I will leave first.

261
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:11,063
Huan Bi see Eunuch out

262
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,544
Please stay, there is no need to see me out.

263
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:15,469
No need. I will see him out.

264
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,343
Keep this for your use.

265
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:30,768
This-

266
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,000
Take it, Xiao Xia is behind me right now.

267
00:18:35,472 --> 00:18:38,669
In two days I'll send over someone with some fabric.

268
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,344
The clothes you are wearing now is already out of style

269
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:46,345
You should change them

270
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:50,386
I'm leaving.

271
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,000
We're heading back.

272
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,400
Come here, little princess. Slowely.

273
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:10,017
Here. Be careful.

274
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,500
The Emperor has arrived.

275
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,300
Rise.

276
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

277
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,000
I just visited Mother. <br>Her complexion still isn't too good.

278
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,811
I heard that you've been taking care of her.

279
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:28,564
It's only right for me to be filial to the Empress Dowager.

280
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,017
Rise.

281
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Emperor, the weather is so nice.

282
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:39,414
Indeed

283
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:44,207
In a few more days it will be the Longtaitou Festival.

284
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:49,469
It is custom to go sightseeing and also to pray for happiness and burn incense.

285
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,100
Your Majesty, are you still intending to pray at Baohua Hall?

286
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:57,891
Every year, it's at Baohua Hall. <br>I haven't even left the palace before.

287
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,300
How is that considered going sightseeing when spring arrives?

288
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:07,600
I heard all the citizens are<br> all heading out of town for the festival

289
00:20:07,735 --> 00:20:08,534
They do.

290
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:14,877
Then I should just stay in the palace and <br>quietly do my work.

291
00:20:14,877 --> 00:20:16,055
Your Majesty...

292
00:20:16,094 --> 00:20:18,416
Longtaitou Festival is a big day.

293
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,700
Proverb says that on the 2nd day for the 2nd lunar month the dragon will raise it's head and there will be great harvests.

294
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,700
This is the day to pray for good weather for the year.

295
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,700
Your Majesty shouldn't carelessly let this go by.

296
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,500
This day, the people love to worship the Flower God to welcome spring the most.

297
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:36,540
The Flower God Temple is the most popular, <br>there's a big crowd there every year.

298
00:20:36,576 --> 00:20:39,343
I was stuck in the middle of the crowd last year,

299
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,000
and my toes were nearly trampled into the ground.

300
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:46,222
Where there are a lot of people it is too noisy.

301
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:48,578
I don't want to approach this kind of spectacle.

302
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:57,018
There's a place that's most suitable for it.

303
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,900
I remember going to Ling Yun Feng when I was young,

304
00:21:02,098 --> 00:21:07,624
and then I head to the Gan Lu Temple afterwards, <br>it takes exactly one day.

305
00:21:07,704 --> 00:21:11,463
I had the exact same idea as her majesty.

306
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:16,864
These days Gan Lu Si's spring colors are really beautiful.

307
00:21:16,903 --> 00:21:20,882
Plus, Gan Lu Si belongs to the Royal Family, <br>it's less crowded

308
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,700
Gan Lu Si

309
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,500
I know that there is a person there that Your Majesty doesn't wish to see.

310
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,000
We're only going there to worship anyways, not to see her.

311
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,800
Plus we can pray for the Empress Dowager's illness,

312
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,500
we will only go to Ling Yun Feng if we have time.

313
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,300
Second day of the second month, <br>everyone heads out of town.

314
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,700
Alright then.

315
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:55,067
Then I'll use this to see the feelings and attitudes of the people.

316
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,500
Yes. I will make the arrangements right away!

317
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,500
Greetings, Imperial Father!

318
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:16,605
I've heard that on the 2nd day of the 2nd month the Emperor will leave the palace to pray for the Empress.

319
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,700
Leaving the palace?<br>Where to?

320
00:22:18,863 --> 00:22:20,222
To Ganlu Temple.

321
00:22:20,265 --> 00:22:21,984
He mustn't go!

322
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:28,100
I have checked . <br>Zhen Huan has tubercolosis and sent away.<br>She is not at the temple.

323
00:22:30,286 --> 00:22:33,463
That's good. <br>Get someone to keep an eye on it.

324
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,400
Let His Majesty go and return early.

325
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,700
Su Peisheng has put a lot of effort into it.

326
00:22:41,983 --> 00:22:48,101
These clothes must have based on my measurements

327
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
These clothes are for you.

328
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:57,368
The colors and patterns are ones you like

329
00:22:57,836 --> 00:23:02,110
And so it is. Let fate take it's course.

330
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,943
What?

331
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,500
I like it.

332
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,600
Su Pei Sheng wants yuor ladyship to dress up

333
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,300
His gifts are for this purpose

334
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,200
I understand Shu Pei Sheng's reasoning

335
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,400
He hopes I can win the Emperor's heart

336
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,509
But there is a risk it may have the opposite effect

337
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:35,400
But Shu Pei Sheng said the Emperor secretly misses you

338
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,711
Even if that is true

339
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:43,624
Someone who treats everyone like his shadows,

340
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,600
He has hurt himself and those around him.

341
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:52,900
His Majesty can be merciless. Does he know what true love is ?

342
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,800
Jin Xi are you moved ?

343
00:23:55,865 --> 00:24:01,540
I noticed Shu Pei Sheng's report did not move my lady

344
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,200
Does my lady not have any hope .. ?

345
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,500
First hurting every part of you,

346
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,903
then applying medication to treat you.

347
00:24:16,424 --> 00:24:18,467
What's the point

348
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:24,300
Whether there is point , as long as His Majesty still thinks of you

349
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,100
Our efforts will not be in vain

350
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,500
Emperor, please have some tea

351
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,400
Where is Consort Wan Ping ?

352
00:24:45,423 --> 00:24:51,263
Your Majesty , Wan Ping was taken ill and she has moved to an abode in Lin Yee peak

353
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:53,797
She's sick?

354
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:56,871
How long has she been ill ?<br>Is it serious ?

355
00:24:56,903 --> 00:25:01,663
Wan Ping .. I believe she is alright now

356
00:25:01,743 --> 00:25:05,623
Nonsense , what do you mean by " I believe"

357
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,543
You are the abbott - do you not know ?

358
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:14,000
You explain to me.<br>She was well when she arrived.

359
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,300
Why has she fallen ill ?<br>Please forgive us your Majesty

360
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:23,400
Wan Ping came to study buddhism .. it's an honor for our temple

361
00:25:23,703 --> 00:25:28,740
All of us were very respectful and treated her well

362
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:36,300
But Wan Ping did not want to bother anyone.<br>She insisted on doing everything herself.

363
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,500
She even looked after the older nuns.<br>She washed, cut wood and drew water ..

364
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:47,661
But she was weak from the start and she caught pneumonia

365
00:25:47,744 --> 00:25:48,703
Yes.

366
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:56,503
So .. she washed , cut wood and drew water.<br>Yes ..

367
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,183
Yes, yes.

368
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:00,183
How is she now?

369
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,800
Since she fell ill we let her rest

370
00:26:06,953 --> 00:26:09,983
Think of it . . she is much better now

371
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,304
Indeed ..

372
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:16,167
Then, lead me to her

373
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:17,357
Yes

374
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,900
Mistress you perfumed your hair .. it is fragrant

375
00:26:27,383 --> 00:26:29,229
It smells good

376
00:26:29,343 --> 00:26:35,284
Let's hope the flowers' fragrance will not dissappoint

377
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,800
Mistress I am afraid...

378
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,500
I am afraid .. of failure

379
00:26:45,943 --> 00:26:47,781
But if we succeed

380
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,800
The road ahead will even be more difficult and dangerous

381
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,600
Except for this road

382
00:26:56,264 --> 00:26:58,150
I have no choice

383
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,400
Mistress why are you dressed so simply in these Buddhist robes?

384
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,400
Since you have decided .. should you not dress and make up ?

385
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,800
In the palace , his Majesty is surrounded by beauty

386
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,200
I want to be simple on purpose

387
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,664
Let's go and pray

388
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:28,200
This dressing is appropriate for this place

389
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,800
His Majesty is arriving

390
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,200
It is one to wish and not to be asked

391
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,500
Abmi Buddha..

392
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,800
Mistress you did not sleep well .. perhaps ..

393
00:29:10,703 --> 00:29:11,943
Your Majesty

394
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:17,277
Majesty ? Why would his Majesty be here ?

395
00:29:17,304 --> 00:29:21,663
Mistress . it's true.<br>It's his Majesty .. I am not lying

396
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:32,863
Huan Huan

397
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,400
The abbott tells me you are here because you are ill

398
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,900
I was told you should be well by now but you still look pale

399
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:51,000
Majesty this is the first time I am here with you.<br>Who would have thought Nun Mo Chu .. erh .. Wan Ping has fallen ill

400
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:57,100
What did you say ? Wan Ping is not sleeping well ?<br>What do you mean by that ?

401
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:03,063
Your Majesty. We were barred from the temple because they said mitstress had tubercolosis.

402
00:30:03,142 --> 00:30:07,501
In the winter her condition worsten

403
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:15,400
But it was not tubercolosis.<br>She was just never able to fully rest and recover

404
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:23,400
With spring and medication there is improvement

405
00:30:23,503 --> 00:30:27,463
But mistress misses Princess and Your Majesty

406
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,300
With worry on her mind - her sleep is disturbed

407
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,400
So her illness has dragged on and she's not fully recovered

408
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,031
Everyone away

409
00:31:51,063 --> 00:31:55,823
Go.. go<br>Don't let anyone come near

410
00:31:55,863 --> 00:31:56,943
No

411
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:02,060
If anyone speaks of this

412
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,200
he will lose his head - understand ?

413
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,100
Understand.<br>Go.

414
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,157
His Majesty ..?

415
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:16,600
His Majesty is in the company of his lady.<br>Stop being a busybody - Go.

416
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,200
Wan Wan I am here

417
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,000
Si Lang I waited for you

418
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:34,903
I feel pain

419
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,500
Si Lang

420
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,500
I never expected it to be so smooth

421
00:32:49,794 --> 00:32:52,742
Both have love in their hearts

422
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,900
It's wonderful

423
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,866
Let's leave

424
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,943
Why are you crying ?

425
00:33:37,943 --> 00:33:41,588
Everyone will fall ill when they are old.

426
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,423
We can be wrong till there is no turning back.

427
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:46,220
Huan Huan knows it herself.

428
00:33:46,263 --> 00:33:48,710
I only know of it today.

429
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:53,343
It seemed like there was nothing wrong to it back then.

430
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:03,995
Huan Huan has always thought that your majesty has no feelings for me at all.

431
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:08,143
But because I am Lung Yue's biological mother.

432
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:13,546
I was only able to stay in the palace because I resembled her majesty.

433
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,701
Huan Huan treating Si Lang like this, it was all because of Huan Huan getting hurt from all the feelings.

434
00:34:23,701 --> 00:34:26,420
There is no use in saying such things now.

435
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,143
Si Lang

436
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,260
At least Si Lang still have some feelings for me.

437
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:40,771
No, even if its just a little

438
00:34:40,852 --> 00:34:43,544
Huan Huan will die without regrets.

439
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,700
Huan Huan has left Si Lang for three years. Not seeing Si Lang for three years

440
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:53,861
Si Lang still thinks of Huan Huan.

441
00:34:54,103 --> 00:34:56,912
I heard his majesty say

442
00:34:57,104 --> 00:35:02,371
Your highness immediately heads here after<br>hearing that I fell sick

443
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:08,625
As long as Huan Huan knows that Si Lang still have some true feelings for me

444
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,300
there will be no regrets from separating us.

445
00:35:13,229 --> 00:35:20,119
If I knew earlier, I would rather lose ten years of my lifespan..

446
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Don't say that.

447
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,823
Huan Huan,

448
00:35:26,946 --> 00:35:31,959
Three years at Gan Lu Si has soften you up a lot,

449
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:40,600
if you weren't so stubborn and head strong, <br>I would have never let you leave.

450
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,600
I voided all your titles three days after Lung Yue is born,

451
00:35:46,623 --> 00:35:49,549
I wanted you to reflect

452
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,551
If your titles still existed,

453
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,420
how would you truly know the hardship outside the Palace?

454
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,589
Nothing matters anymore,

455
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,900
Huan Huan just wants Si Lang to be here

456
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,000
Si Lang,

457
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:09,500
I was so scared I will never see you again.

458
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,469
and Lung Yue too

459
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:15,104
Our Lung Yue

460
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,100
Lung Yue is good, she's an obedient girl

461
00:36:20,582 --> 00:36:23,063
Jing Fei loves her very much.

462
00:36:23,226 --> 00:36:27,393
Too bad I can't bring her here,

463
00:36:27,463 --> 00:36:29,903
Huan Huan has been sick for a long time

464
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:35,713
it's karma for being so stubborn before.

465
00:36:35,906 --> 00:36:39,303
Even though I left the city,

466
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:43,423
but not a single person do I not miss.

467
00:36:43,585 --> 00:36:46,710
Fang Ruo came and visit me,

468
00:36:46,754 --> 00:36:49,703
I don't even dare to ask about you

469
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,500
I'm scared that Fang Ruo will tell me that <br>you have new girls beside you,

470
00:36:57,103 --> 00:37:00,024
I can only pray a thousand times a day

471
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,900
hoping your health, and Lung Yue's

472
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,155
Now that I have reunited with Si Lang,

473
00:37:10,183 --> 00:37:13,470
it's already used all the luck in my life

474
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,920
You have already received punishment for the past,

475
00:37:18,023 --> 00:37:26,750
if you didn't leave the Palace for three years,<br>how am I suppose to realize how much I miss you?

476
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,811
Si Lang's love,

477
00:37:29,983 --> 00:37:33,661
puts me into shame.

478
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,711
Did you know

479
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,783
how much the Palace has changed?

480
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:44,029
I don't even have anyone to talk to

481
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,000
After you left,

482
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:53,509
I went to Xui Yu Xian once,

483
00:37:53,543 --> 00:37:58,423
Other than Chang Xiang Xi, you didn't bring anything else

484
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:03,806
Even this was left onto the table.

485
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:08,420
Chang Xiang Xi was given by your Highness,

486
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,195
Other than Xiang Xi, there's nothing that I can't leave behind.

487
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:16,746
Huan Huan,

488
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:25,263
I made you leave behind everything for me, <br>For me again, you should start dressing up

489
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,700
I will obey everything that Si Lang says

490
00:38:28,903 --> 00:38:31,589
I just one thing to ask,

491
00:38:31,636 --> 00:38:37,508
I am just an abandoned concubine, <br>being able to serve your Highness again is my luck

492
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:43,669
I don't want to stir up any trouble in the palace.

493
00:38:43,703 --> 00:38:51,863
Still calling your abandoned? <br>How did I address you in front of Jin Xi and them?

494
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:57,844
Huan Huan, you never left my heart all these years

495
00:38:57,997 --> 00:39:03,303
I've always treated you as Huan Pin.

496
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:12,229
If you don't wish to cause any stirrups,<br>I won't even tell the Queen

497
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:15,063
Your life here on after,

498
00:39:15,132 --> 00:39:18,310
I will make sure Xu Pei Xing takes care of it.

499
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:24,983
As long as you still have me in your heart,

500
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,209
I don't mind spending my life here.

501
00:39:30,023 --> 00:39:33,550
Huan Huan is so understanding,

502
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,263
I won't let you be along your whole life.

503
00:39:37,482 --> 00:39:45,344
The Empress Dowager is feeling unwell, <br>I shall make Gan Lu Si hosts prayers every month,

504
00:39:45,575 --> 00:39:49,221
and I will come here myself.
