00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Episode 54

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,000
Niang Niang, the emperor has returned from Galu Temple today

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,300
Oh? To return at this time

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's invite his Majesty over for dinner

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,800
But the Emperor has already sent a message

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,200
stating that he is tired tonight

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,200
and does not allow you to visit

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,300
He is resting now

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,800
February 2nd is an important day

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,000
and the Emperor must stay in the palane

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,600
How come today...

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,500
Go and find out what happened at Gan lu Temple today

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,800
I already asked about it

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,600
they were tight-lipped;

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,400
I could not find out anything.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,200
The more you cannot get any information, the stranger it is

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,700
His Majesty is most concern about your ladyship

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,700
On reaching the palace,

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,600
He has immediately ordered me to bring these gifts to you

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,900
Thank you for your efforts

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,300
regarding keeping His Majesty in the palace,

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,400
then that would have to depend on your abilities

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes, I will try my best.

24
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,700
Then the problems regarding my father

25
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Regarding this i know

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,400
This matter should not be raised by your ladyship.<br>Otherwise it will raise suspicion with his Majesty.

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,700
He may catch on that it was all planned by you

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,900
So I already looked for a chance to bring it up

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,400
His Majesty will understand your concern

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,800
he naturally would care about your father

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,900
Although your father is still under sentence

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,000
His Majesty has already ordered his return to the capital for treatment

33
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,500
It should not be long when he is back

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,500
How should I thank you for your great kindness?

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,800
Your ladyship - you are a Consort .. I would not dare think of being rewarded

36
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,300
With my position today

37
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,100
even if you asked for something

38
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,700
I may not be able to afford to give it

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,600
Why are you refusing ?

40
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,500
Please your ladyship .. I am just lending my weak support

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,300
i've heard that

42
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,800
Recently the emperor often goes towards Ganlu temple

43
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,900
he says it's to burn incense

44
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,400
Ganlu temple...Don't you know who lives there?

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,600
But didn't she say that

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Zhen Huan is no longer at Ganlu Temple?

47
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,100
I've heard that every time the Emperor goes to Ganlu Temple

48
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,100
he always go to Lin Yu peak where Zhen Huan lives

49
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,200
How did we let our guard down?

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,000
The Emperor is having such a close relationship with<br>an abandoned concubine,

51
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,900
it will damage his name.

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,100
I wonder what you plan to do

53
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,700
Plan?

54
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,200
Let's first see if this is just merely gossip

55
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,700
then decide what to do

56
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,000
Then if the emperor goes to Ganlu Temple again to pray

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,700
why don't you, my lady, request to accompany him...

58
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,600
like that will make you feel safer

59
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,000
If His Majesty insists, I can't do anything either

60
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,700
I can see how it goes <br> and think of a plan as we go on

61
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,400
My lady, Su Gong Gong came

62
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,700
my lady, may i ask how are you?

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,600
Gong Gong, please have a seat

64
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,200
thank you my lady <br> the tea

65
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,100
although this tea isn't anything special

66
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,500
but the fragrance is wonderful

67
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,100
thank you my lady

68
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,800
My lady <br>Miss<br>

69
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,000
What happened to you?

70
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,900
Our madame has been nauseous for days

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,200
Congratulations my lady, congratulations!

72
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,200
Gong gong, you are the first to find out

73
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,800
Am I?

74
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,500
Forgive me for being nosy to ask

75
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,200
But how long has My Lady been pregnant?

76
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,300
About a bit over a month

77
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
Isn't that precisely when

78
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,700
His Majesty visits this Ling Yun Temple for the first time?

79
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,100
I really have to congratulate you, My Lady

80
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,100
Your pregnancy is just the right time

81
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,200
you can use this to return to the palace

82
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,400
and everything will be fine

83
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,700
When The Emperor knows of my pregnancy,

84
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,600
he might be too occupied and happy...

85
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,800
so I have to ask you to please remind him from time to time

86
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes yes yes

87
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,400
The Empress hasn't been well lately, and already preoccupied with many palace issues...

88
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,900
there is no need for my pregnancy to be known to others

89
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Yes, this I understand

90
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,300
Only the emperor needs to know.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,800
But with My Lady's pregnancy

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,300
why didn't you call for a doctor?

93
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
Our Lady does not have a title as of right now

94
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,800
a lot of things may seem awkward

95
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,200
It's better to lay low.

96
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,200
But Imperial Doctor Wen

97
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,300
has some acquaintance with our Our lady

98
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,900
Why don't we ask him to come help <br> our Niang Niang do a check up

99
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,900
It's more appropriate that way.

100
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,700
Jing Xi has a point, being so thorough in her thinking.<br>This is good as well...

101
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,300
His Majesty has always been full of praises for Imperial Doctor Wen's ethics.

102
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,100
He will definitely agree to this arrangement.

103
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,300
Gong Gong has been by Huang Shang's <br>side for so long

104
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,300
you would know how to ask

105
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,200
Yes.

106
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
All I hope for, in this wilderness...

107
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,900
is to quietly expect my labour here.

108
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,300
Niang Niang you must be joking;

109
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,000
how will the Emperor let you give birth here?

110
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,900
You must return to the palace

111
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,700
I am a disposed concubine

112
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,600
How can i return?

113
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,400
I just hope for my child to grow up peacefully

114
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,100
and it will be fine

115
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,000
How can you say that?

116
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,500
Your child is of royal blood

117
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,100
how can he be just outside?

118
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Pus the Emperor always takes care of his children

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,500
he will treat yours the same.

120
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,000
The Emperor already treats me this way,

121
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,100
it is already my greatest fortune

122
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,400
How can i ask for more?

123
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,300
If Huang Shang

124
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,800
gives my child a tite

125
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,700
it is a given they will return to the palace

126
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,000
then i will be lonely

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,300
Niang Niang, you are pregnant

128
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,300
you can not be depressed

129
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,400
Your majesty and your royal baby is the most important.

130
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,400
i will think of a way to talk to Huang shang

131
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,400
you must be very careful

132
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,700
no one can know

133
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,700
our Niang Niang is outside the palace

134
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,700
and if someone finds out about the pregnancy

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,400
i don't know what mess will happen

136
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,200
i understand the circumstances <br> you take care of Niang Niang

137
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,100
I will return and talk to Huang Shang

138
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,800
to send the Imperial Doctor to come see Niang Niang

139
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,300
Thank you Gong Gong

140
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,600
I'll take my leave

141
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,000
Wen Da Ren,

142
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,000
I wonder what bring Gong Gong here

143
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,800
Wan Da Ren, let's go straight to point.

144
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,100
today i came here by Huang Shang's command

145
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,600
to give you an assignment

146
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,000
huang shang would like you

147
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,700
to help someone perform a check up

148
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,400
Thank you,

149
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,700
may i ask who?

150
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,800
Speaking of this person, you know of them too

151
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,600
I know them?

152
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
today this person

153
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,200
is living in Ling Yun Feng

154
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,400
could it be...?

155
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,200
this task was personally given by Huang Shang

156
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,500
no one must know

157
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,400
do you understand me?

158
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
I understand

159
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,700
Wen Da Ren!

160
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,900
Look at all the sweat on your forehead

161
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,700
Have a seat and drink some tea

162
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,200
i am not in the mood to drink tea

163
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,600
Your father has gone back to the city,

164
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,200
Xu Pi Xing asked me to

165
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,000
ask the Royal Doctors to take care of him

166
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,300
Xu Pei Xing is the King's man,

167
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,000
why would he suddenly bring your father back?

168
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,300
now that you already know

169
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,400
why do you still waste your breathe to ask me?

170
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,000
Did he tell you,

171
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,200
I am pregnant

172
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,400
and you are to help me do a check up

173
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,000
but my pregnancy

174
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,300
isnt at the 2 months that you know of

175
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
but only a little over 1 month

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,900
how did this happen?

177
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,400
because i saw huang shang

178
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,800
my child is huang shang's child

179
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,700
That's why Xu Pei Sheng is asking you to take care of me.

180
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,600
but this child is obviously...

181
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,600
whose child it is is not important

182
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,000
it is important that huang shang believes <br> that this child is his

183
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,200
believes that this child is only one month

184
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,600
you're crazy

185
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,300
this is treason. what if...

186
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,500
there is no what if.

187
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
the only 'what if' is if you won't help me

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,500
You go tell the Emperor

189
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,100
the baby that I've had for over 2 months

190
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,000
is not even his!

191
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,700
You know I will not

192
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,800
i already told you

193
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,700
If you give birth to this child,

194
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,700
I will take care of you and your child for my whole life,

195
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
you can rest assured now.

196
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,900
You can take care of my child and I for your entire life

197
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,300
but can you take my sick father

198
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,900
from Ling Gu Tower and bring him back?

199
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,100
Can you protect my family members

200
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,300
from being harmed by others?

201
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
Can you find out Yun Li's real cause of death,

202
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,000
help him get revenge?

203
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,800
Either way it's because I am useless,

204
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,100
I cannot help you

205
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,100
It's not that you cannot help me

206
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,200
I just have a hard life.

207
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,600
it was so hard to leave the Forbidden City

208
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
but now I must return,

209
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,500
because this world is the Emperor's.

210
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,000
Nobody could help me that much.

211
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,500
If there are other options,

212
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,400
I also am not necessarily willing to take this step.

213
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
If you are willing to help me, then help me;

214
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,800
if you can't, I won't force you to either.

215
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
The path my child and I must take is very hard already,

216
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,100
No matter how tough...

217
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Step by step, even if I were to die

218
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,600
I must protect the child.

219
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,500
But if I lead you down the way,

220
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,700
I can only lead you back onto your old track.

221
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,200
this road is too bitter

222
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,500
Outside the palace I have no one to rely on

223
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,600
i can only wait

224
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,500
life in the palace is horrible but

225
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,200
it is better than

226
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,300
being killed without putting up a fight.

227
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,500
Shi Chu ge ge, there are things you are not willing to do, but

228
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,300
I am also not willing.

229
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,800
but in the end

230
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,000
i am not a carefree person

231
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,600
and just not care

232
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,800
if we already know of this day

233
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,800
i wish you never found about

234
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,500
__ 's death

235
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,100
Fine, Huan-er.

236
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,200
I can do anything about you, like always.

237
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,000
Besides helping you and listening to you,

238
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,200
I have no other way to help you.

239
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Since you want to protect others,

240
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,200
I must protect you with all my power.

241
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,300
Your humble servant greets Your Highness.

242
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,500
whats the situation

243
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,900
Huan Bin Niang Niang is 1 month <br> into her pregnancy

244
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,600
only...

245
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Only what?

246
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,600
Only that... her pregnancy is unstable and thus,

247
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,400
must rest

248
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,600
To stabilize the child, I'm afraid she can't have close contact.

249
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,300
you work hard to take care of Huan Bin

250
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,500
As for the Imperial Medical College, go whenever you can.

251
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,700
Yes

252
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,000
you may get up

253
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,100
Thank you Emperor

254
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,500
Jin Xi, get me some water

255
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,600
Emperor

256
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,000
Now... and you're still full of formalities.

257
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,200
When did you arrive?

258
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,400
i didnt know

259
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,300
Jing Xi didn't even wake me up.

260
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,100
The Emperor has already been here for an hour,

261
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,100
and seeing that you were sleeping, he did not want to wake you up.

262
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,200
i told them not to wake up

263
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:26,600
to let you sleep some more

264
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,500
When Su Pei Sheng informed me of your pregnancy,

265
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
I was overjoyed.

266
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,000
Emperor, you shouldn't have...

267
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,600
Despite your joy,

268
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,600
you could come by any day you wish.

269
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,400
It just rained, and the road isn't easy for walking...

270
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,500
why'd you rush here?

271
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,300
Your pregnancy is a joyous event

272
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
I am very happy

273
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,400
You're blessed indeed,

274
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,700
I visited you for the first time, and you got pregnant then.

275
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Emperor

276
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,600
I am worried about you

277
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,100
Imperial Doctor Wen said your pregnancy is unstable

278
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,200
he said you can't do this or do that

279
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,100
i am so worried

280
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,000
To have my lover be this worried over me, I am...

281
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,300
If not for your pregnancy,

282
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,100
there's too many things in the palace to worry about...

283
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,300
I, can never find another reason to be this happy.

284
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,100
here, i told them to make

285
00:14:19,187 --> 00:14:22,657
bird's nest with yogurt

286
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
this was your favourite

287
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,600
Chang Xiang Si (the longing) is still with you...

288
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,800
since you left 3 year agos, no was has been able

289
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,600
to play such a nice song

290
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,400
You were fine just now, why the sudden tears?

291
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,400
Huan Huan, I, have not played it for a long time.

292
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,900
It feels like centuries...

293
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,500
To have you back by my side, it already feels that way.

294
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,600
come with me back to the palace

295
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,500
i am a disposed concubine

296
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,400
now that i even have your child

297
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,500
i don't want to think about returning to the palace

298
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,800
disposed can be re-titled<br> come with me

299
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,900
would the Empress Dowager allow it

300
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,600
now that you are pregnant

301
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,200
she would not prevent this

302
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,300
i will plan everything for you

303
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,400
what did you say?<br> she is pregnant?!

304
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,800
it is certain

305
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,300
i personally saw imperial doctor wen

306
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,200
prescribe medicine for pregnant women

307
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,000
and in the palace no one is pregnant

308
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Able to be under the care of Imperial Doctor Wen...

309
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,000
it could only be the one at Ling Yun Mountain.

310
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,600
go out

311
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,100
yes

312
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,300
no matter how we tried

313
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,700
we couldn't stop that fox's stomach

314
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,600
if she wasn't pregnant, it would be easier

315
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,400
pregnant so fast! this isn't good

316
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,400
Niang Niang

317
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,000
it was so hard for the Palace to be peaceful

318
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,400
if we allow her and the child to return

319
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,100
the palace will have drastic changes

320
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,900
Empress, think of something

321
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,400
even though there isn't any rule banning disposed concubine <br> from returning to the palace

322
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,000
but not matter what <br> i can not let her return!

323
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,800
right now, we can only keep her outside

324
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,900
To eliminate her completely, and rid of further complications.

325
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,300
Your Highness, bad news...

326
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,200
the empress dowager is sick and fainted again

327
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,900
Quickly order Bao Hua Dian (a temple),

328
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
to pray for the Empress Dowager.

329
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,500
yes

330
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Make other preparations.

331
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,000
I'll go over, and personally pray

332
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,900
for the empress dowager

333
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,400
Missy, by constricting your tummy... <br>Will the baby be harmed?

334
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,600
it shouldn't

335
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,600
Imperial Doctor Wen said, Concubine Wang in the past...

336
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,600
is scared of the empress' power

337
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,100
is pregnant but too scared to say anything

338
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,300
And she constricts her tummy daily until labour.

339
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,600
Besides, I'm only doing it once every few days.

340
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,300
only doing it for the next few months,

341
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,500
and not constricting it too tightly.

342
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,800
Imperial Doctor Wen has sent some tonics over as well.

343
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,200
and after donning this baggy top,

344
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,200
it does look like you are only one month pregnant.

345
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
As long as the Emperor doesn't come too close,

346
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,800
we can hide this

347
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,400
Imperial Doctor Wen, do you have news of Huan-er?

348
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,900
she does have something she told me to tell you

349
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,000
what is it?

350
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,200
she is pregnant

351
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,300
huang shang will probably bring her back to the palace

352
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,700
really?

353
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,300
but returning to the palace

354
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,300
isn't something huang shang can say for himself

355
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:36,236
we still need the empress dowager's approval

356
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,300
you are always at the empress dowager's side

357
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
if the empress dowager mentions anything

358
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,200
would you please help add some good words?

359
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,000
yes yes of course

360
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,300
returning to the palace is only the beginning

361
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,600
the rest of the road is endless

362
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,500
niang niang you must be prepared

363
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,700
If Empress and Concubine An were to know of your return...

364
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,400
they won't let you go easily

365
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,700
huang shang has made up his mind to bring me back

366
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,400
the empress may not be able to prevent it

367
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,800
She could only do the Emperor a favour and grant it, while welcoming me with much sinister plans.

368
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,000
And when I finally go back to the Palace,

369
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,000
she will use her power against me

370
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,200
that would be hard to face

371
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,400
who would know after these couple years

372
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,100
no one in the palace is able to face her

373
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,400
She might be arrogant,

374
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,400
but whatever she does,

375
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,800
it is of no use.

376
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,500
If you return to the Palace with a Title,

377
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,500
and give birth to a royal baby in a few months,

378
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,300
then you're settled down.

379
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,700
Even if she picks a fight with you,

380
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100
you might not lose.

381
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,100
I just hope that even with all the lust around you,

382
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,900
you will not forget our purpose.

383
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,800
Lady, help!

384
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,700
Tai Fei

385
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,600
heard about ____'s death,

386
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,600
and she hasn't eaten or drank anything for three days.

387
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,500
She wouldn't listen

388
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,200
Bring me to her.

389
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,100
Please give us some time,

390
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,700
The dead has died,

391
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:51,800
should the Living follow?

392
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,800
I want to follow him as well,

393
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,200
and just end everything

394
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,800
and leave behind all the troubles.

395
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,800
Do you just want your son,

396
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,100
but not your grandson?

397
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,900
The baby I am carrying right now,

398
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,000
is still waiting to call your Granny.

399
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
The baby doesn't have a father already,

400
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,800
he doesn't wanna lose his grandma too

401
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:45,300
I only have this one son,

402
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,700
I didn't take good care of him

403
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,700
Now I am watching my own son leave,

404
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,800
Yun Li, you were going to be father soon,

405
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:22,200
but you will never see that now.

406
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,700
Huan-er, you're pregnant.

407
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,600
Don't get too worked up or grieved. Don't cry anymore...

408
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,300
Royal Concubine... eat something.

409
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,900
Yes... I'll just eat something.

410
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,200
Ji Yun. Ji Yun, bring in some dishes.

411
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,000
Coming.

412
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,400
Royal Concubine, in the future... I'm afraid,

413
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,700
I can no longer come by An Xi Guan anymore.

414
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,000
Why?

415
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,800
The Emperor means to bring me back to the palace.

416
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,900
And I have agreed.

417
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,000
No harm doing so...

418
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,400
You cannot defy the Emperor's orders anyway.

419
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,400
But, the child in your tummy...

420
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,500
The Emperor thinks it's his.

421
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,300
That's why he insisted on my return.

422
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,500
My son, Chong Li, has just died...

423
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:33,300
and you want my grandchild to

424
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,900
address someone else as his father? You...!

425
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,300
Royal Concubine, do you know that...

426
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,200
Chong Li's death was no accident.

427
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,200
He was murdered.

428
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,800
The boat he was on, was tampered with.

429
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,600
That's why he died!

430
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,200
I've never thought that his death was by accident.

431
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,800
Chong Li did not die in peace.

432
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,500
I must avenge him.

433
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,700
But regrettably, I am merely a woman.

434
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,000
But do you

435
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,200
have to bring my grandson into the palace?

436
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,800
I didn't want it to be this way

437
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,800
but this is the only way

438
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,300
I can seek revenge for Yun Li.

439
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,500
The only way I can keep our baby.

440
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,600
And the only way,

441
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,500
I can protect my family.

442
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,800
Tai Fei, did you know

443
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,300
rather than living like this,

444
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,500
I would rather die.

445
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,600
But for Yun Li, and for our baby,

446
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,800
and for the Zhen's.

447
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,200
I still have to do it no matter how difficult it will be.

448
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,700
Let's leave.

449
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,400
What happened back there is too unlucky,<br>none of you should tell anyone.

450
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,400
Your majesty should take a walk,

451
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,400
since you're not in a good mood.

452
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,400
Let's go look at fishes.

453
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,000
Empress Dowager is seriously ill,

454
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,100
how can I relax?

455
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,100
Let's just reutrn to the Palace.

456
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,400
Yes.

457
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,900
are you alright your highness?

458
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,400
quick get the doctor

459
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,100
Your Lady!

460
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,700
Fire! Fire! Fire!

461
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,200
Fire! Protect her majesty!

462
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,400
quick come

463
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,100
help

464
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,500
Fire!

465
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,600
Fire!

466
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,700
Fire!

467
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Fire! Fire!

468
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,700
The Queen has always been mannered and had good posture,

469
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,800
why did she fall?

470
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,700
It must have been you guys' ignorance,

471
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,500
Its not their fault.

472
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,800
I was just careless,

473
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,600
Thank goodness I wasn't hurt badly.

474
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,800
What did you find?

475
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,800
The concrete was unstable,

476
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,600
that's why her Majesty fall.

477
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,400
It's just my carelessness then.

478
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,000
But just now when you were at the Temple,

479
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,000
you dropped the incense twice, that is so unlucky

480
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,600
Don't say useless things.

481
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,500
Your Highness! There was a fire!

482
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,900
What happened?

483
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,900
Is the Empress Dowager okay?

484
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,100
she is alright

485
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,100
and she wasn't injured.

486
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,600
Thank goodness that the fire wasn't big, and it's been taken care of

487
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,400
That's good, I must head to her Majesty now.

488
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,700
Your Highness,

489
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,200
please allow me to speak

490
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,200
both the dowager and her majesty suffered from shock today

491
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,800
Empress and the Empress Dowager met with such unfortunate events in the same day.

492
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,700
one sprain her ankle and the other faced a fire

493
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,600
I am wondering

494
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,700
if we should invite Zhen Tianjin here

495
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,500
I will visit the dowager

496
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,000
invite Zhen Tianjin to see me later

497
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,800
yes

498
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,200
Yes.

499
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,800
greetings

500
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,500
stand up

501
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,500
the dowager and her majesty suffered shocks today

502
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,500
fire or sprain ankle

503
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,400
is it heaven's will?

504
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,400
I came to report

505
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,500
after observing the sky

506
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,100
found that

507
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,700
normally stars that shine in October

508
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,600
is specially shining today

509
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,100
it has a "tail" star and could outshine the moon

510
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,300
really?

511
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,900
yes

512
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,100
Danger, immense danger.

513
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,500
it could mean clamality

514
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,400
the moon is represented by the dowager and the majesty in the palace

515
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,600
the star with the "tail" implies someone who is pregnant

516
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,900
this person is likely in the north

517
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,400
can could harm the health of both ladies

518
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,900
is the person in the palace now?

519
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,800
no

520
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,100
the person should be outside the palace now

521
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,800
she is getting nearer though

522
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,400
if so

523
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,000
the two ladies will definitely suffer

524
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,900
a lay who is pregnant and is outside the palace

525
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,000
north

526
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,000
north

527
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,300
Su Peisheng

528
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,900
delay your preparation for Zhen Huan to return to the palace

529
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,564
yes

530
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,800
lady,Su told us

531
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,600
the king is worried about observations done by Tian

532
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,300
looks like you can't return to the palace

533
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,900
I knew it already,

534
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,300
it will be difficult for me to return

535
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,800
That's good too,

536
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,700
at least we now know what they're doing.

537
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,800
Ask Xu Pei Sheng to tell Mei Jie Jie,

538
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,900
everything will only work if she is able<br>to convine the Empress Dowager

539
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,600
Yes, I should go do that.

540
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,200
Your majesty was injured a few days ago,

541
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,800
thank goodness that you look very well today.

542
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,700
Please be careful and take care of yourself,

543
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,600
or else I will not be able to sleep well.

544
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,700
Thank goodness I wasn't injured seriously,

545
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,700
Resting a few days is enough.

546
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,700
But these few days,

547
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,800
I miss you a lot.

548
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,400
Thank you for your care,

549
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,600
Good that your lessons finished early,

550
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,200
then you can spend some time with Mom.

551
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,500
So, did you study?

552
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,900
Yes

553
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
That's good, as long as you're hardworking,

554
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,100
your Father will like you a lot.

555
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,600
Ethics lie in big knowledge...

556
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,500
someone chanting phrases from the ancient books

557
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,400
In the past, those who wish to rule...

558
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,700
must rule his family before he can rule the country.

559
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,400
Who is looking after 4th prince?

560
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,200
a few of the nannies from Yuanmingyuan

561
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,900
did the king visit the 4th prince?

562
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,500
I don't think so

563
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,600
3rd prince

564
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,600
you study with him

565
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,800
what do you think of his progress

566
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,400
the teachers said he started lat

567
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,900
but he is smart so he learnt fast

568
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,100
then what did the king says

569
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,700
king doesn't speak with him

570
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,400
if you compare with him

571
00:33:55,652 --> 00:33:58,571
he is hardworking

572
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,600
he is still learning

573
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,300
and can't compare with my progress

574
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,100
for now

575
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,000
if he continues to be hardworking

576
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,500
and serious

577
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,000
he will be successful

578
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,700
in future

579
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
...

580
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,300
...

581
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,500
4th prince, you ate very little tonight

582
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,400
you started studies again, your eyes must be tird

583
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,300
leave me alone

584
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,600
I feel sorry for you

585
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,400
you will spoil you health

586
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
I am very lucky to be back here

587
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
every time dad sees me

588
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,900
he only asked about my studies

589
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,900
if I don't do well

590
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,200
no new will think well of me

591
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,800
the supper is here

592
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,700
put it here

593
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,700
this is green bean soup

594
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,400
it is good for improving eyesight

595
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,100
drink up

596
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,500
no, you drink it

597
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,200
I asked them to cook it for you

598
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,700
you drink it

599
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,700
keep quiet

600
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,400
I can't sleep if I can't memorize the notes

601
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,600
ai...

602
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,900

603
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,300
yes

604
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,100
are you alright?

605
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,200
mama

606
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,300

607
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:09,921
4th prince are you alright

608
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,000
don't be afraid

609
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,800
I am Huping

610
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,000
Huiping, someone wants to kill me

611
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,500
..

612
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,200
don't say nonsense

613
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,600
my mama has died

614
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,900
in my room

615
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,500
Hui lady, save me

616
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,300
don't be afraid

617
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,900
if you trust me,let me think of some ideas

618
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,800
greetings

619
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,900
why are you here

620
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,900
don't cry

621
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,000
come

622
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,800
don't blame him

623
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,500
he was frighten

624
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,800
his mama

625
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,000
drank his soup and died

626
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,300
on the spot

627
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,500
what

628
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,100
I am no one like me

629
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,700
why does someone wants to kill me

630
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
why

631
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,500
I think

632
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,400
he doesn't have his birth mother here

633
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,800
no one to protect him

634
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,600
for his safety

635
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
can he

636
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
stay with you

637
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,300
for safety

638
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,900
sure

639
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
good boy

640
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,400
you saw something you shouldn't see

641
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,100
and frighten yourself

642
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,300
do we want to investigate

643
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
..

644
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,300
it will be difficult

645
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,600
one bowl of green bean soup

646
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,300
many people were involved

647
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,900
it will be a big

648
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,100
issue if people know

649
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,200
I understand

650
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,381
because of the sky observations

651
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,400
it affected the dowager and her majesty

652
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,700
Wanping is pregnant and can't return to the palace

653
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,600
only able to stay outside

654
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,800
in the long run

655
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,900
not sure if this affects the "moons" or the entire dynasty lineage

656
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
shift his things to my court

657
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
..

658
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,700
let him stay here

659
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,800
..

660
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,100
see who dares to hurt him

661
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,400
yes

662
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,100
I will pack his stuff later

663
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,300
my grandson

664
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,100
go back

665
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,200
yes

666
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:53,100
what do you think

667
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,100
who did it

668
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,400
you know it in your heart

669
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,100
I don't dare to say more

670
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,000
to hurt your feelings

671
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,200
besides her

672
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,400
who would dare to do it

673
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,400
she ha 3 sons

674
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,400
don't think she will do it?

675
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,200
because of her sons

676
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,100
she needs to give them a smoother path to the throne

677
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,500
she is getting bolder

678
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,000
there is no one who can control her

679
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,200
in the long run

680
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,300
our lineage may be ended

681
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,900

682
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,900

685
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,400
useless

686
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,300

687
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,900
