1
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,700
Queen is also here

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,100
Greetings, Your Majesty.

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,600
Yes.

4
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:21,072
Peace upon you, Mother.

5
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:23,742
Mother, are you feeling better today?

6
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:25,353
I feel better now

7
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:28,980
The floor it's cold, stand up and take a sit

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,300
I asked you to come to tell you something

9
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:39,009
I will listen to your instructions.

10
00:00:39,022 --> 00:00:41,503
I've heard that Wan concubine was pregnant

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,000
but due to astrological forecasts, the King dares not bring her into the palace.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,500
This matter affects the harem. <br>I dare not make the decision on my own.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,400
I worry more about your health.

14
00:00:53,118 --> 00:00:56,744
I'm old, body is not strong

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,492
nothing is more important than descendants

16
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,200
<br>

17
00:01:00,968 --> 00:01:01,700
<br>

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,600
Empress, is that right?

19
00:01:04,703 --> 00:01:06,360
yes

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,379
I think

21
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:12,200
the May Yan <i> (constellation) </i> crisis is not an urgent issue.

22
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:16,184
Me and Empress are not afraid of that

23
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:19,461
But do you know

24
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:22,657
that Fourth Prince was almost poisoned by someone?

25
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,102
He was so shocked by that incident that he has refused to return to the palace.

26
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:28,792
He can only live beside me, only I can take care of him

27
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:34,646
If anything bad were to happen to Concubine Wan's child,

28
00:01:34,663 --> 00:01:38,343
the Emperor and I will not forgive her.

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,100
I want bring Concubine Wan back to the palace immediately.

30
00:01:43,197 --> 00:01:45,639
Madam Zhen is really fortunate.

31
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,994
She was pregnant right after one visit from the Emperor.

32
00:01:47,994 --> 00:01:50,777
I'm afraid that many people would envy her.

33
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,700
It's just that previously, Madam Zhen's position was taken away from her. Technically, she's a deposed concubine.

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,700
Everyone knows this in the palace.

35
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,350
And there's no precedent of any deposed concubine returning to the palace.

36
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:07,064
If a position is taken away, it can be given too.

37
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:11,743
As such, all I have to do in confer a new title on her.

38
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:16,308
I'm afraid such a huge action may cause rumors outside.

39
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Mother, what Wan Pin has is the royal family's descendant

40
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,064
We can't leave her out in the wild on her own.

41
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:28,305
She should be brought back to the palace and given proper care.

42
00:02:29,577 --> 00:02:32,625
How are you going to bring her back? And when?

43
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:36,510
You're the Emperor. The decision is all yours.

44
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,500
It's just that I know that my illness is severe. <br>I won't be able to take care of Fourth Prince for long.

45
00:02:42,623 --> 00:02:47,668
I hope Your Majesty can arrange for him to have an adopted mother.

46
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:52,662
Don't leave this child alone and without any support, like a frightened bird.

47
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:54,340
I understand.

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,100
You should also remember...

49
00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:59,540
even if Concubine Wan has offspring,

50
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,700
you cannot favor her excessively, and allow her to become arrogant again.

51
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,340
I think the Empress won't object either, right?

52
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,107
If Zhen Meimei could come back, it will naturally be great.

53
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:16,067
I miss her pretty much

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,400
The process of creating the middle notes of this goose pear tent is truly unique.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,900
A sliver of sandalwood paste.

56
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:34,103
Then remove the core of the goose pear, <br> and pour the fragrant paste in.

57
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,300
Continue to replace the cover of the goose pear.

58
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:42,502
Then use this silver pot to steam the pear over fire for thirty minutes.

59
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,944
Tell me after you've finished.

60
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:45,876
Yes.

61
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,821
I didn't know you were coming, Empress.

62
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:53,386
I didn't welcome you from afar. Please forgive me.

63
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,902
Get up.

64
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:55,784
Yes.

65
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:58,649
I'm just here to see how you mix the fragrances.

66
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:01,929
I didn't have anyone announce me, and came in on my own.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,300
Empress, if you need any incense, just send a servant to notify me. I'll send it over to you personally.

68
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:10,638
I'm afraid the servants may not be able to convey the message clearly...

69
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:15,007
resulting with you not only being unable to concoct the appropriate scent, <br>but knocking yourself out in the process.

70
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:18,211
I'm unintelligent. Please explain, Niangniang.

71
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,496
His Majesty is adamant on bring Concubine Wan back to the palace.

72
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:24,612
What fragrance do you have that can change the Emperor's mind?

73
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:26,731
I'm useless.

74
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:29,409
What are your plans, Niangniang?

75
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:31,452
What plans can I have?

76
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,100
If the Emperor insists that she come back, <br>I'll just let her come back.

77
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,400
If she's right under my eyelids, I'll feel a lot more assured.

78
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:47,860
Previously I have spoken to you about constructing a new building for Concubine Wan -- has it been approved?

79
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:52,335
It is an inconsequential issue, <br> but just thinking about it makes me angry.

80
00:04:53,624 --> 00:04:56,064
How is that so?

81
00:04:58,551 --> 00:05:02,819
Today, I raised this matter at court.

82
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:08,576
It was as if all the ministers had discussed it beforehand. <br>All of them stood out to object to it.

83
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:13,720
They talked about the South-West flooding and <br> how the stores are being stretched.

84
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:18,249
To make such large-scale preparations for a <br> mere concubine's welcome.

85
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:23,203
may cause the people's hearts to lose the sense of security, and create a mountain out of a molehill.

86
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:26,541
The ministers have always been like that. <br>They always make a mountain out of a molehill.

87
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,888
Your Majesty, just make your own decisions.

88
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:33,162
With blanket opposition from the ministers, it is not appropriate to go ahead with the plans.

89
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:35,410
I've already thought it through.

90
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:40,202
I'll have the housekeeping department renovate Yongshou Palace. I don't think they'll have anything to say.

91
00:05:40,283 --> 00:05:41,819
That's good too.

92
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:44,892
As long as Concubine Wan doesn't feel slighted.

93
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:47,204
But now that they've brought it up,

94
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,000
I feel that this matter needs more effort to solve.

95
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:58,603
They opposed my welcome of a banished concubine back, indirectly also labelling her as <br>the daughter of a condemned minister.

96
00:05:58,694 --> 00:06:01,756
Born of the Han army's lower five banners,

97
00:06:01,802 --> 00:06:06,479
her birth is neither noble, nor has she given birth to a male royalty.

98
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,000
Even the child in her womb is of an unknown gender.

99
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,600
So many reasons...

100
00:06:11,643 --> 00:06:14,771
it looks like it'll indeed be a challenge to bring Concubine Wan back to the palace.

101
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,285
Then how about...

102
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:17,963
I've already made up my mind.

103
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:21,014
Since she is born of a Fifth Han Banner's status,

104
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,482
I will raise her banner...

105
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:27,101
and make her status that of a Third Manchu Banner.

106
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,414
Her family name will be 'Niuhulu'.

107
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:33,275
You have to consider this matter in detail, Your Majesty.

108
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:37,724
If my king truly wishes to raise the status of Zhen Shi, <br> to give her a new family name,

109
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,564
can add a character 'Jia' at the back of the family name 'Zhen',

110
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,570
and thus raise it to the family name of 'Zhen Jia'.

111
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,960
After she's given a new family name, she will no longer be the condemned minster, Zhen Yuan Dao's daughter.

112
00:06:49,238 --> 00:06:54,698
Even if she doesn't have a son, <br>there are many princes in the palace without mothers.

113
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,700
Your Majesty, you are referring to Fourth Prince?

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But Fourth Prince is of a lowly birth.

115
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
It's precisely because he's of lowly birth...

116
00:07:04,235 --> 00:07:08,457
that he needs a mother with significant status.

117
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:14,203
From today onwards, Fourth Prince's biological mother will no longer be the servant girl, Li Jingui...

118
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:17,892
but my concubine, Niuhulu Zhen Huan.

119
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:21,916
But Concubine Wan is only 22 years old!

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,200
The age difference with Fourth Prince is only 7 years! <br>How can she be his mother?

121
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:27,818
That's not difficult.

122
00:07:27,862 --> 00:07:31,967
We'll just treat it as Huanhuan gave birth to Fourth Prince,

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,300
then left the palace to pray for the country. <br> Thus, she will not be regarded as a banished concubine.

124
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:43,191
The age is a small matter. <br>We'll just add 10 years to her age.

125
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:46,338
What's wrong with saying she's 32?

126
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:49,695
If that's what you want to do, Your Majesty, I have nothing else to say.

127
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:52,747
But I'm afraid we may not be able to stop the rumors.

128
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:54,763
What is there to fear from people's words?

129
00:07:54,776 --> 00:07:57,325
Regardless of whether they are willing to talk about it,

130
00:07:57,342 --> 00:08:02,816
or if they are not willing to do so. I'm determined to give Huan Huan the position of a consort (fei).

131
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:09,373
The character 'Huan' is not good.

132
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:13,041
Many troubles were raised by past issues.

133
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:16,494
I'm going to change her title.

134
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:20,104
The past is too heavily dark to be pursued.

135
00:08:20,496 --> 00:08:23,865
The future's path is bright and brilliant.

136
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:26,182
I'll choose the character 'Xi'.

137
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,692
to bring across the meaning of light and brilliance.

138
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,000
I think that it's great.

139
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,700
Everything in the palace has been prepared accordingly.

140
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,200
We will receive my lady back to the palace soon.

141
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,900
The Emperor said that he wants to title your ladyship as 'Xi Fei', for you to live in Longevity Hall,

142
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:52,576
and for your to raise the Fourth Prince.

143
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:54,575
The Fourth Prince?

144
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:55,707
Yes.

145
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,600
Your ladyship was originally a banished concubine. To return to the palace may cause a lot of rumours.

146
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:05,380
I suspect the Emperor has given your ladyship <br> a new surname of 'Niuhulu',

147
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,900
to take the guise of the Fourth Prince's birth mother.

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,100
Even your age has been raised by ten years, to become thirty-two years.

149
00:09:12,215 --> 00:09:13,536
Thirty-two.

150
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,819
How does our lady look like she is thirty-two years old?

151
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:18,786
Of course she doesn't look the age.

152
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,784
That's only to minimize the possible rumours.

153
00:09:23,784 --> 00:09:26,055
This is all a small matter

154
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:29,059
The Emperor's decision is the best

155
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,400
The Emperor also says, it's not suitable for your ladyship to continue to live in Ling Yun Feng,

156
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:40,000
for your ladyship to bear travelling to and staying in Gan Lu Si for a few days, before we receive you from over there.

157
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:41,880
We'll just follow to what the Emperor arranges.

158
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:45,681
Forgiving those at the Dewdrop Temple won't result in any controversies.

159
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:47,476
If we go back now,

160
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:50,677
I wonder how those detestable people at Dewdrop Temple will react.

161
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,900
Just thinking about it makes me satisfied.

162
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,700
Mistress, why aren't you dressed up yet?

163
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:04,171
Soon Su Peisheng will arrive with the imperial decree to bring you back to the palace.

164
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,057
Huan Bi, help me dress up.

165
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Mistress, this time's return,

166
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,100
some things you must let go of them.

167
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:34,189
For example...

168
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,793
Heart

169
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,500
But not a cruel heart.

170
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:45,003
A cruel heart is still a heart.

171
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,400
You need to be just cruel

172
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,487
without any heart.

173
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,500
Jinxi, besides you,

174
00:10:59,522 --> 00:11:03,813
no one else would say this to me.

175
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,000
According to Heavenly will, the Emperor declares,

176
00:11:19,736 --> 00:11:25,241
Niuhulu Zhenhuan, of a well-known clan, gentle, respectable, and great

177
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,800
By the Empress Dowager's decree, is canonized as Xi Fei.

178
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,900
Thanks to the Emperor's grace.

179
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,100
Congratulations to Niangniang.

180
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:47,301
The emperor means to tell you,

181
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:49,490
the ceremony will be held three days from now.

182
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,203
At that time, the Official of Canonization will escort Niangniang back to the palace.

183
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,700
Thanks, Gong Gong.

184
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,500
Empress Mother, I want to take Zhen Huan back to the palace in a few days.

185
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,947
I only need to decide on the Official of Canonization.

186
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:09,044
Just have the Ministry of Rites find a capable person.

187
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:13,889
I gather that she is already three months pregnant.

188
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:17,764
It's about time to have her return to the palace and rest up.

189
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,500
Emperor, Emperor, he's back, he's back!

190
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,800
So panicky that you can't even speak properly.

191
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:27,123
Who is it who has returned?

192
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,700
Who's there?

193
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,600
Master!

194
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:48,584
Is it really you, Wang Ye?

195
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:50,991
Is Mother in?

196
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:54,900
Imperial Concubine Dowager, look who has returned! <br> Mother!

197
00:12:54,943 --> 00:13:00,781
Mother, I have come to greet you. <br> Yun Li!

198
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,665
Yun Li!

199
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:05,584
Is it really you?

200
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,870
Yes, it's me! I came to see you as soon as I got back!

201
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:10,022
Yun Li!

202
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:18,148
They all said that you have died in the Yellow River!

203
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:23,902
I cried my eyes out!

204
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:26,433
Mother, don't be sad.

205
00:13:26,464 --> 00:13:30,068
Look, am I not great right now?

206
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:34,205
Yes, I'm not being sad.

207
00:13:34,242 --> 00:13:37,351
I'm being happy, happy!

208
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:39,864
Right,

209
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:43,510
have you met the Emperor and the Empress Dowager yet?

210
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,383
I heard that the Empress Dowager has become more sickly each day.

211
00:13:46,462 --> 00:13:51,863
I sent Ah Jin to the palace immediately when I got back so that I can have time to see you.

212
00:13:54,982 --> 00:13:56,981
Yun Li,

213
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,659
You are back,

214
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,257
but Huan Er, she's not here anymore.

215
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,000
Mother, what are you saying?

216
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Yun Li, Huan Er she

217
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,300
she's returning to the palace.

218
00:14:19,853 --> 00:14:22,732
Yun Li, you have to understand.

219
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:28,292
Huan Er also has her own grievances.

220
00:14:30,657 --> 00:14:33,388
Huan Er is the same as I.

221
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:37,333
We both thought that you had died!

222
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:41,846
But even if there are numerous rumors,

223
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,400
even if she has her grievances- <br> Huan Er, she...

224
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:52,575
Yun Li, we all have our own ambitions.

225
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,699
Please don't hold a grudge against Huan Er.

226
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,092
One day,

227
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:04,694
you will understand her difficulties.

228
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,180
Mother,

229
00:15:06,258 --> 00:15:08,965
I must go find her.

230
00:15:09,012 --> 00:15:11,675
I must go find her and get an explanation from her.

231
00:15:11,692 --> 00:15:14,339
Yun Li, Yun Li!

232
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,700
The imperial decree has already been passed.

233
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:27,886
I can never see the blue sky outside the palace ever again.

234
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,200
Huan Er!

235
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,200
Huan Er! Huan Er!

236
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,200
Wang Ye!

237
00:15:56,532 --> 00:16:00,362
Huan Er, are you waiting for me?

238
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,500
Look, it's Niangniang's wedding day.

239
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:16,730
It would be terrible to get your clothes wet. Go in and change into more festive-looking clothes.

240
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,500
Master is alive and well. I will immediately go give thanks and sacrifice to the gods.

241
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,800
Once the edict has been passed, <br>nothing can be reversed.

242
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:32,123
If you use your emotions on this matter,

243
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:35,539
I'm afraid the consequences will be disastrous.

244
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,300
Niangniang?

245
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,645
You're really going back to the palace?

246
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,300
I never thought that in this lifetime,

247
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:58,734
I would be able to see Wang Ye back in peace.

248
00:16:58,765 --> 00:17:00,016
Wang Ye?

249
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,400
We were only apart for four months, <br>and the changes happened so quickly?

250
00:17:06,454 --> 00:17:09,045
You're a Niangniang again?

251
00:17:10,524 --> 00:17:14,083
It must be because I haven't heard that title in a long time.

252
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:15,846
It's foreign.

253
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:19,847
It's good that you've come back.

254
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'd rather die in Dianzang and never return!

255
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:28,257
Huan Er.

256
00:17:28,293 --> 00:17:32,773
I was only able to make it back because I was thinking of you!

257
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,400
But the moment I'm back...

258
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:39,889
I have to watch you being welcomed back to the palace...

259
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,100
-and return to my brother's side?<br>-If you didn't return,

260
00:17:44,136 --> 00:17:47,541
did you think that I would spend my life thinking of you and missing you?

261
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:54,129
If you didn't return, you would never have realized that I'm such a heartless woman!

262
00:17:55,361 --> 00:18:00,097
I have always been a heartless woman!

263
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,611
Heartless?

264
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,649
Heartless?

265
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,300
I'm apologetic towards Wang Ye. Saying anything more would be futile. I ask you to leave now.

266
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,300
Grand Concubine, Miss Huanbi has come.

267
00:18:56,391 --> 00:18:58,230
Peace upon you, Grand Concubine.

268
00:18:58,258 --> 00:18:59,909
Why have you come?

269
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:03,299
Mistress asked me to look for Wang Ye.

270
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:05,415
What did Huan Er say?

271
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:17,551
Is everything ready?

272
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,098
Please don't worry, Wang Ye.

273
00:19:20,137 --> 00:19:21,273
Alright.

274
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,500
I will wait for her at that time.

275
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:28,328
Wang Ye.

276
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,800
Take care.

277
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,142
Mother, I have something up.

278
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:49,542
Just go

279
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:03,400
Grand Concubine, Wang Ye is so upset. Why won't you tell him the truth?

280
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,300
How could I have guessed that he would be in this much pain?

281
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:12,971
If I tell him the truth, by his temper,

282
00:20:13,018 --> 00:20:18,180
he would want to ignore everything and runaway with Huan Er.

283
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:23,770
Then the Emperor would also realize that Huan Er's unborn child is not his.

284
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,500
But if so, Wang Ye would hold a deep grudge against Mistress.

285
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:35,300
It has to be this way. <br>Everyone's life is on the line.

286
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:43,862
For now, we can only take the lesser of the two evils.

287
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,000
You're finally willing to see me.

288
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,428
Seeing you return peacefully...

289
00:21:08,463 --> 00:21:11,543
I can also return to the palace in peace.

290
00:21:13,302 --> 00:21:15,590
Only for this?

291
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Then what did you think?

292
00:21:18,503 --> 00:21:20,428
We haven't seen each other for so long.

293
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,100
-And you're not even asking where I've been?<br>-Is that important?

294
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,000
Seeing you alive and well in front of me,

295
00:21:33,103 --> 00:21:35,744
I have no more regrets.

296
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,500
So you only have no regrets when I'm well?

297
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:40,474
Then during the times when rumors of my death abounded,

298
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,300
you must have thought of me day and night.

299
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:47,090
I've often heard that Wang Ye overthinks.

300
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,200
It really seems to be the case here.

301
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:59,800
Our hearts have long mirrored each others'. Today you are returning to the palace so that's why you've been so cold to me!

302
00:22:02,062 --> 00:22:04,623
Our fates have already ended.

303
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:06,474
Fates?

304
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,784
Before, you said that there's no fates involved in love.

305
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,800
You said only weaklings who refuse to fend for themselves would use fates as an excuse.

306
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:23,400
Great fates is an excuse for intimacy while ended fates is a pretext for breaking up! <br> I also said,

307
00:22:23,464 --> 00:22:27,120
When the end of the road has been reached with nowhere to go,

308
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:30,862
that's when I say the fates have ended.

309
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,800
I only want to tell you right now,

310
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:37,906
that I want to end our relation.

311
00:22:39,385 --> 00:22:42,870
I'm sure someone has already told you

312
00:22:42,943 --> 00:22:46,105
that I have been pregnant for three months.

313
00:22:47,985 --> 00:22:49,617
Three months.

314
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,500
You must know that this child is not yours.

315
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,800
Right, three months.

316
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:04,184
When I have left for only one month.

317
00:23:04,294 --> 00:23:07,582
you were with my brother.

318
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,100
Everyone spread rumors of my death, but that's alright.

319
00:23:12,218 --> 00:23:16,301
It's also ok that you did this for your survival. But my heart hurts.

320
00:23:16,338 --> 00:23:18,098
Huan Er,

321
00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:22,662
You walked out of the palace because of a broken heart,

322
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:25,780
why must you go back to that brokenhearted place to torture yourself?

323
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:29,735
I really can't hold this in.

324
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:38,700
I would rather, I would rather have Wen Shichu take care of you for the rest of your life! At least he was true to you.

325
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,700
Only your brother can give what I want!

326
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:47,200
My father's live, my whole clan's survival, and the riches!

327
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,400
I was in the Dewdrop Temple for years. I have had enough of insults!

328
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:54,748
I wanted to live that life of glory!

329
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,100
I don't believe it.

330
00:23:57,264 --> 00:23:59,303
Fortune and glory?

331
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,701
Since when were fortune and glory even in the line of your sight?

332
00:24:02,744 --> 00:24:06,495
If you are really gonna use this to degrade yourself,

333
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:10,505
then you are also degrading all my feelings toward you.

334
00:24:10,638 --> 00:24:14,159
The woman I love and cherish,

335
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,300
how can she be like this? <br> Wang Ye met the wrong person.

336
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,300
I am that type of mortal.

337
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,000
I want to live well. I want the people around me to live well.

338
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:27,645
I don't want to be stepped on again!

339
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:33,740
That day,

340
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,900
my boat was sinking in the Yellow River. Everything was washed away!

341
00:24:38,971 --> 00:24:43,612
If I had not been familiar with the water, I would have been a corpse in the river!

342
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
I finally reached the shores.

343
00:24:46,577 --> 00:24:52,056
Yet I walked into the trap of Zhun Ge Er, who capured me and took me to their land.

344
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:57,312
Do you still remember that snake-bitten man whom I rescued that day?

345
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:01,405
He was Zhun Ge Er leader's eldest son, Mo Ge.

346
00:25:01,414 --> 00:25:04,660
I walked right into his trap.

347
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:13,900
When he found out who I was .. he did not mistreat me.<br>I escaped. I was concerned you were worried.

348
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,700
I rushed back to see you and mother

349
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,400
Yun Li

350
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,800
Huan Er

351
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:39,416
It's not too late

352
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,400
Let's run away. I can give up my royal titles

353
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,500
We can marry without honor

354
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,300
Your child will be like my flesh and blood

355
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,400
It's too late

356
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:55,656
Yun Li

357
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:02,300
Man do not just live for love

358
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:04,546
Consider this ..

359
00:26:04,587 --> 00:26:09,467
if we run off all the people around us will be held responsible

360
00:26:09,497 --> 00:26:13,616
We cannot be selfish and sacrifice them

361
00:26:13,742 --> 00:26:17,054
I cannot do it and neither can you

362
00:26:18,863 --> 00:26:22,581
If I could ..

363
00:26:22,617 --> 00:26:26,186
I would give up everything to be with you

364
00:26:26,226 --> 00:26:34,589
But we know our parents and those who are dear to us will pay with their lives

365
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:40,600
There is no where we can hide

366
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,335
We have no choices left

367
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,900
Huan Er

368
00:26:49,004 --> 00:26:51,822
From the beginning ..

369
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:55,418
if you had rejected me

370
00:26:55,987 --> 00:26:58,328
I would never believe

371
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,800
Your rejection today ..

372
00:27:02,935 --> 00:27:05,254
I understand

373
00:27:05,254 --> 00:27:09,375
You will never be by my side again.

374
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:16,300
When you left - our fates were sealed

375
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,300
Huan Er .. let me embrace you

376
00:27:30,347 --> 00:27:32,899
Even if for a moment

377
00:27:32,935 --> 00:27:35,665
From today on

378
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,029
I can embrace anyone

379
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:45,300
but I will never have you in my arms again

380
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,200
Yun Li

381
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,704
Being with you is like a dream

382
00:28:05,744 --> 00:28:10,659
I do not want to wake from this dream

383
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:15,995
The happiest days of my life was living this dream

384
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,000
you gave me those moments

385
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:25,222
it's the same for me

386
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:30,929
Alright, Huan Er. <br> With your words,

387
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I have not wasted this life.

388
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,007
With her, you will support and guard <br> each other into your old age.

389
00:28:45,092 --> 00:28:48,570
You will live a very good life.

390
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,200
You will be in bliss for the rest of your life.

391
00:28:52,288 --> 00:28:56,530
Are you saying such things to make my heart hurt?

392
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:03,600
My everything, <br> has been summarised by that marriage contract.

393
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:12,300
There is only you and no one else

394
00:29:31,211 --> 00:29:34,411
My king, Duke Guo has come back.

395
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,700
Greetings to my king.

396
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,000
Rise up quickly, quickly.

397
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,700
Sit.

398
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:50,570
It's good that you are back.

399
00:29:50,634 --> 00:29:53,491
Good that you're back.

400
00:29:53,537 --> 00:29:56,341
When I heard that you died in the Huang River,

401
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:59,570
I was heartbroken.

402
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:02,690
Mother, who is sick in bed,

403
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,288
is also having restless days and nights.

404
00:30:05,376 --> 00:30:10,574
That you are able to come back <br> must be a blessing of the gods.

405
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,800
It's the prayers of my brother, <br> that enabled me to salvage my life.

406
00:30:15,202 --> 00:30:20,999
You have returned at the right time. <br> I have an auspicious task,

407
00:30:21,043 --> 00:30:24,553
and I have been wondering who to assign it to. <br> - Please instruct me, brother.

408
00:30:24,604 --> 00:30:28,205
I want to welcome Xi Fei back to the Palace.

409
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:31,604
That Concubine Wan.

410
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:37,200
Other people tends to refute me<br>when I start talking about this.

411
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,900
Your Majesty.<br>It's only reasonable for you to bring back your loved one back to the Palace.

412
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,900
Furthermore, I heard that Xi Fei is pregnant.

413
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,000
I must say you're quite informed.

414
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:56,942
Xi Fei is coming back after being banished.

415
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,474
People are talking about it outside.

416
00:31:00,481 --> 00:31:05,595
I plan to find a someone with a respectable status to be the Canonizing envoy, to welcome Xi Fei back to the Palace.

417
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:11,300
But several Princes have been tactfully declining.

418
00:31:11,555 --> 00:31:15,915
Is it because if I become the canonizing envoy, I would add on to Xi Fei's glory?

419
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,500
If it isn't so, I wouldn't have sought for your help

420
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:27,244
I know what to do. As long as..

421
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,000
it's for Brother, I'm willing to go forward.

422
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,400
Truly worthy of my brother.<br>So tomorrow..

423
00:31:37,486 --> 00:31:42,408
You will use half of the empress's ceremonial devices to welcome Zhen back to the palace.

424
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,300
Edict obeyed.

425
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,800
I heard that the Emperor will use half of the Empress's ceremony to welcome back Zhen.

426
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,563
She is already given family name of 'Niuhulu'.

427
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,100
In order to prevent other people from gossiping,

428
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,500
the Emperor has raised her status to the Embroidered Yellow Flag

429
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,500
and given her the great Niuhulu name.

430
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,100
And even calls her the birth mother of the Fourth Prince,

431
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:10,924
who has been praying for the country's wellbeing in the Dewdrop Temple. She got a son for free

432
00:32:10,964 --> 00:32:13,447
and also entered the top three flags.

433
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:19,300
And her Palace of Longevity is so luxurious that people gape at the sight of it.

434
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:23,243
But the Fourth Prince is already so old, how can they be mother and son?

435
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,085
The Emperor can falsely credit that boy as her son,

436
00:32:26,132 --> 00:32:31,518
what's falsifying her age by ten years? <br> Is there really no way to prevent her from coming back, Niang Niang?

437
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,098
What's so bad about her return?

438
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:38,161
Though all land graced by the heavenly dew is the King's land,

439
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:42,920
the Harem is entirely under my control.

440
00:32:42,964 --> 00:32:46,531
Let her return if she wants to.

441
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:49,893
Niang Niang's intelligence makes me realize my own lacking.

442
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:56,782
But for An Pin, you've always known Zhen Huan's personality so you should take this opportunity.

443
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,453
Edict obeyed.

444
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:05,491
Qi Pin, you must have your father keep mentioning Zhen Huan's return to the palace in the courts.

445
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:08,971
He must stain her name and ruin her reputation.

446
00:33:09,011 --> 00:33:12,892
You asking the Emperor to refurnish the Palace of Longevity has been interpreted as outsiders as the Emperor favoring Zhen Huan.

447
00:33:12,931 --> 00:33:15,330
This rumor has been widely spread.

448
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:17,498
You must complete this task well.

449
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,000
These days, An Pin will be in charge of serving the Emperor.

450
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Yes

451
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,600
To me, this gaudy wedding attire

452
00:33:35,686 --> 00:33:38,162
is like heavy chains,

453
00:33:38,193 --> 00:33:40,970
locking away all my life's happiness.

454
00:33:42,475 --> 00:33:46,533
When you're used to it, it won't be uncomfortable anymore.

455
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,100
Let us go outside.

456
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,800
Wang Ye,

457
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:20,700
Prince Guojun greets Consort Xi. The carriage is already waiting outside the palace.

458
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,400
Please rise, Prince Guojun.

459
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:30,742
Wang Ye has fallen flowers on your clothes.

460
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,224
Fallen flowers wither.

461
00:34:33,262 --> 00:34:37,182
Wang Ye shouldn't have gone near them.

462
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,900
Fallen flowers also have feelings. Why remove them?

463
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,100
Huan Bi,

464
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,988
I think we have forgotten Niang Niang's Ornament of Good Wishes.

465
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:55,473
How about you go find it with me?

466
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:32,000
Huan Er wishes Wang Ye to have an abundance of children

467
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,900
and longlasting fortunes.

468
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,200
Without you,

469
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:45,600
this longlasting fortune is only a complete defeat for me.

470
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,600
This official respectfully welcomes Consort Xi back to the palace.

471
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,800
To show the great imperial mercy,

472
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,700
Servant Su Peisheng greets Consort Xi Niang Niang.

473
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:13,520
We respectfully escort Consort Xi Niang Niang back to the palace.

474
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:16,763
Niang Niang, please.

475
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,500
Su Gong Gong please wait. I still have some trivial matters.

476
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,900
Jingbai Shitai.

477
00:37:32,694 --> 00:37:34,696
Niang Niang,

478
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,800
I have meditated here for numerous years

479
00:37:38,846 --> 00:37:41,886
thanks to Shitai's care.

480
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,800
Nuns should naturally embrace kindness.

481
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,900
Niang Niang, Niang Niang doesn't need to thank me.

482
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:52,207
Shitai's care for me in the past days,

483
00:37:52,254 --> 00:37:54,587
I will never forget.

484
00:37:54,609 --> 00:37:57,734
I will definitely repay you.

485
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,100
Jingan Shitai <br> Here.

486
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:08,528
I have always separated my goodwill from my grudges,

487
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,200
Shitai's care for me in those days I thank you greatly.

488
00:38:13,866 --> 00:38:15,807
Jinxi,

489
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:19,129
get two of my handcopied Peace Scripture

490
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:21,538
to gift to Jingan Shitai.

491
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,819
I know that you have never liked gold or silver.

492
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:29,891
These two scripture books are just small tokens of my appreciation.

493
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:37,200
Thanks for Niang Niang's gift, but I've alway had one wish that I hope Niang Niang can fulfill for me.

494
00:38:37,258 --> 00:38:41,700
I understand all that you have said.

495
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,613
I will let her filthy life live.

496
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:49,130
In hopes of her repenting and directing her heart towards Buddha.

497
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,728
Thanks to Niang Niang's great mercy.

498
00:38:51,772 --> 00:38:54,826
Thanks to Niang Niang's kindness.

499
00:38:54,858 --> 00:38:58,470
Our Buddha will definitely protect Niang Niang.

500
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,600
Where's Mo Yan?

501
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,174
I am here, what does Niang Niang want?
