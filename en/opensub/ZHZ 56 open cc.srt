00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,600
Episode 56

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,100
Consort Xi returns!

3
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,700
Sincerely Emperor, I got returned.

4
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,700
Bless my Emperor and Empress healthy

5
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,500
and nourish from perpetual farewell(Enzer) entitled by the Heaven. .

6
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,000
Have you enjoyed safe journey in your long trip?

7
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,900
Fine

8
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,100
When heard from Emperor's message that you are arriving,

9
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,400
we were both really pleased to see the back of you.

10
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,200
Many thanks to Empress' concern！

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,100
Since Feudatory Guo has been promoted to the position of Ambassador,

12
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,000
you are to be engaged in the management of my harem.

13
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,700
Since all harem are present here,

14
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,700
Feudatory Guo,please establish the decree to the public for me.

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,300
Yes,Majesty！

16
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,700
On the Royal Decree of the Emperor,

17
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,400
Eulogize thee Daicing, thanks god for good fortune,

18
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,900
thy only lady with tolerance,charisma and the character of goodness,

19
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,800
Niuhulu Zhen Xuan,

20
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,000
born in aristocratic family and behave modest and courteous,

21
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
specially endorsed with Galeries’ kindly permission,

22
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,500
to bestowed as Consort Xi.

23
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,300
End of edict.

24
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,000
Consort Xi is here.

25
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,800
The mission is accomplished successfully by your humble servant(Poor Feudatory Guo,no excuse for couples to date),my Emperor.

26
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,000
How brave my mighty right-hand, you are suffering a lot.

27
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,300
I should thank you,specially！

28
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,100
If you would like,

29
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,300
you can make reparation to me with your priceless antiques as reward,

30
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,200
Just a bit of cake!

31
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,000
in case that I can't tolerant the itch for misery unrequited love(Sigh,Feudatory Gao,you've fallen in forbidden love!)

32
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,300
For the sake of Daicing's fortune and prosperity,

33
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
shortly after giving birth to my Prince Hong Li,

34
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,600
Consort Xi devote herself in

35
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,000
volunteering in blessing.

36
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,800
I'm very grateful for her charity work.

37
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,500
So I brought her back in this moment.

38
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,700
I heard Consort Xi is the previous Concubines Wan.<br>Left Caption:Changzai Kang<br>Right Caption:Imperial Concubine Zhen

39
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,700
Does it matter?

40
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,100
She is whatever the Emperor entitled.

41
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,900
I thought I have no chance to see you later.

42
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,000
Unexpectedly,we encounter right now!

43
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,600
Long time no see, you behave and posses as usual.<br>(No advancement means you are a loser!)

44
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,100
Consort Xi, you look a bit pale today,maybe you should have a rest!

45
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,800
Have you tired yourself on the way here?

46
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,800
Pregnant lady shouldn't stand outside for too long

47
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,000
You should go in and rest

48
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,100
Concubine Pin is delightful when hearing from you!

49
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
In order to welcome Meimei,

50
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,800
Emperor specially renovated Yongshou Palace for you.

51
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,100
Emperor is calculating and make full devotion in the renovation affairs,

52
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,300
besides he decorated with enormous jewelry

53
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,600
from the treasure house.

54
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:44,325
He didn't allow us to take a peek

55
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,300
until you come back.

56
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,500
Why don't Jiejie invite us over?

57
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,900
Your chance will come in future,

58
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,100
why in a hurry?

59
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,100
After Consort Xi settle down,it is never too late to visit.

60
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,700
Let me accompany you!(Too amenity!)

61
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,300
I know your favorite flower is water lily.

62
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,800
So I asked the servants to place a few dozen vats of water lily here,

63
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,000
especially for your affectionate care.

64
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,200
Humble consort is in tremendous pleasure especially for your shelter and special care.

65
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,400
When I asked them to renovate this place,

66
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,000
I told them to paint the walls red.

67
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,300
Very few get this privilege, but you're exception.

68
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,600
During these years, no matter who is favored,

69
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,300
Emperor has never bestowed this honour.

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,100
I'm overwhelmed by Your Majesty's love

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,800
Come and take a look at your bedroom.

72
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,000
Bless my emperor！

73
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,300
Su Peisheng.

74
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,500
Yes?

75
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,300
You've done a good job.

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,200
You are to be promoted as eunuchs of Imperial Household.

77
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes,Emperor.

78
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,000
Emperor,Yongshou Palace is far more luxury.

79
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,900
I can not match up with it.

80
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,600
Please allow me to live somewhere else.

81
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,800
XuanXuan, you've suffered a lot outside

82
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,000
This is the least

83
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,200
that I can do

84
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,800
You are serious.

85
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,200
The journey is not as long as it seems,

86
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,800
as if the distance between you and I.(Just close as Durex?)

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,700
You don't have to feel uneasy.

88
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,500
Everything was prepared in my order.(A forcible meme？)

89
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,900
Empress even make some recommendations on her own.

90
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,800
There won't be gossips.

91
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,800
This incense smells very sweet.

92
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,700
Right, that's the smell of pear.

93
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,700
It's invented during the Southern Tang Dynasty by Empress Zhou Er.

94
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,000
After its abdication,

95
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,400
the recipe for this scent is lost.

96
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,500
How did you get this?

97
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,800
Ling Rong is a master of making scents.

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,700
It's made by herself.

99
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,300
She put much effort and

100
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,000
used hundreds of ingredients for this.

101
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,800
Others may not be as patient as her.

102
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,800
Whenever I can't sleep,

103
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,700
I felt better after I smell this.

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,500
Divine scent.

105
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,700
I come up with the pear trees at Suiyu Palace.

106
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,700
Exactly,since those good pear trees are to be memorized,

107
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,000
but they can't be replanted,yet,<br>(Even Emperor have satisfactions!)

108
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,600
that's why I used this scent in replacement.

109
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Su Peisheng<br>- What can I do for you,Emperor?

110
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,200
Arrange a few capable servants to serve at Yongshou Palace.

111
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Don't worry, Emperor.

112
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,700
I've made the necessary arrangements.

113
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,800
Greetings to Emperor and Consort Xi.

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,500
Raise up!<br>- Yes!

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,200
Emperor,when Concubine Hui knew of Consort Xi has returned,

116
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
She's afraid new servants may not be experienced.

117
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:22,590
So she asked Eunuch Yunzi to come back and serve.

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,200
No one is as provident as Consort Xi,

119
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,100
plus Concubine Hui.

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,400
I'm going to Shoukang Palace now.

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,600
See you tonight.

122
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,100
Escort

123
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Greetings to Consort Xi Niangniang.

124
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,600
Raise up.

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,300
Yes?

126
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,200
How's Concubine Hui?

127
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,700
She's pretty fine.

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,100
The only thing is that Emperor hasn't visited her for a long while

129
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,400
Hui Pin and the servants

130
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,300
have been looking forward to your return

131
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
There are not many old staff now

132
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,100
So the Imperial Household sent a group of new servants

133
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,600
to come and serve Niangniang

134
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,100
Are there any gossips about my return?

135
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,700
Whatever they say

136
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,400
Niangniang please don't take it to heart

137
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,800
But...

138
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,800
I heard the officials are objecting violently

139
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,500
about the renovation of Yongshou Palace

140
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,200
Even 10th Prince

141
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,900
They've been sending letters to Emperor saying...

142
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,500
that I returned as an abandoned consort

143
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,100
is unheard of

144
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,100
Yet my return is widely publicized

145
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,700
So they think I'll bring trouble to the palace, am I right?

146
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,400
They didn't put it so rudely

147
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,000
Niangniang is the mother of Hongli, and prayed for our country

148
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,000
Who dares to mention your abandonment?

149
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,100
The officials are like that

150
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,000
let them be. It's okay

151
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,600
Niangniang doesn't have to listen to them

152
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,200
You should put your mind on Jingren Palace

153
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,200
Even though Yongshou Palace needs renovation,

154
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,200
it doesn't have to be so grandiose

155
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,400
Haven't you heard just now

156
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,400
that Empress also made many adjustments?

157
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,400
How would she have such kindness?

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,700
She's just pleasing Emperor

159
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,800
and acting virtuous

160
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,900
So that people outside would think that

161
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,900
I'm a vixen who's spellbinding Emperor

162
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,300
Thus worsening my reputation

163
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Focus on the future instead

164
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,200
Jinxi

165
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,300
Go get Physician Wen

166
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,000
Niangniang, rest assured

167
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,000
There's no abortive drug

168
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,000
like musk in this

169
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,600
Instead, the sweet smell of pear

170
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,900
is very good in calming the nerves

171
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,300
I just wanted to make sure

172
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes of course

173
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,100
I'll just add

174
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,000
that when you use this incense

175
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,700
you must not place ylang-ylang in the room

176
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,700
Ylang-ylang is not poisonous

177
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,300
and has calming properties

178
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,300
Are they toxic combinations?

179
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
No

180
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,200
It's just that they'll increase sexual vitality

181
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Love potion is not allowed in the palace

182
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,500
Who dares to use it?

183
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,900
Moreover, ylang-ylang is rare

184
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,500
Niangniang, Hongli wishes to see you

185
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,600
You may leave first

186
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,500
I'll take my leave

187
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,300
Please let him in<br>- Yes

188
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,200
Greetings to Mother

189
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,600
Hurry rise

190
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,900
Let me take a look at you

191
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,600
You've grown taller

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,300
I've not seen you in a long while

193
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,000
I miss you very much

194
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,800
Hui Pin Niangniang told me

195
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,200
if you are around

196
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,100
I won't be a wild motherless child

197
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,600
With you, I won't lonely

198
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,800
I know

199
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,000
that you love me the most in the palace

200
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,800
Although you understand that,

201
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,100
but I've to tell you a few things

202
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,800
You've many mothers within the palace

203
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,800
There're Empress and Emperor

204
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,100
But you've to remember

205
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,100
no matter who your biological mother is

206
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,700
no matter how much you miss her

207
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,500
I'm your biological mother in front of everyone

208
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,900
You don't have to feel bad

209
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,100
You are the son of Aisin Gioro clan

210
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
and Niuhulu clan

211
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,300
My honour and disgrace is one with yours

212
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Yes understood

213
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,400
My return has created gossips

214
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,300
Act like you didn't hear them

215
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,000
Just remember

216
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,800
you are the son of Emperor

217
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,800
A respectable prince

218
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,100
Just like the other princes

219
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yes

220
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,900
I won't forget

221
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,200
Good

222
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,600
Greetings to Empress

223
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,100
Wish you to good health and longevity

224
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,000
Rise and sit

225
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,400
Thank you Niangniang

226
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,500
Jianqiu serve the tea

227
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,600
It's not a big occasion today

228
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,500
Xi Fei's come so early

229
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,100
I should have come yesterday when I just arrived

230
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,700
So I'm here to ask for forgiveness

231
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,200
You're pregnant

232
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,300
and just came back from Ganlu Temple

233
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,700
Nothing wrong in resting

234
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,100
We'll see each other in future anyway

235
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,800
No hurry

236
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,200
Empress is caring. But I don't dare to be unrespectful

237
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,200
I won't forget your kindness

238
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,100
so I prayed everyday at Ganlu Temple

239
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
I asked for a bead bracelet to be blessed by Buddha

240
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,600
and hope that there'll be a day I can give this to Niangniang

241
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,200
May Niangniang be blessed

242
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,100
That's sincere

243
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,200
Gifts are not that important

244
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,100
More importantly is Meimei's wisdom

245
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,500
to predict our meeting in the palace again

246
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,300
Niangniang here are some flowers for your hairdo

247
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,300
You still remember the rule of serving me

248
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,400
by making my hairdo

249
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,900
It's my job

250
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,900
I won't forget the regulations

251
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,900
Time flies

252
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,500
You haven't change a bit

253
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,700
and have become prettier

254
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,200
Even time has doted on you

255
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,800
unlike me. I've become old

256
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,800
You're the mother of the world

257
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,000
Elegant like this peony

258
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,300
What made Niangniang say such emotional words?

259
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,700
So what if I'm a peony?

260
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,000
Any flower will wilt one day

261
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,600
just the matter of sooner or later

262
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,300
Niangniang the other consorts have arrived

263
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,996
They're all waiting outside

264
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,300
Xi Fei Let's go together

265
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,300
Since Xi Fei is back

266
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,800
Jing Fei, you should bring Princess Longyue

267
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,800
to visit Xi Fei often

268
00:15:44,057 --> 00:15:46,610
Xi Fei is Longyue's biological mother after all

269
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,700
After Xi Fei has given birth

270
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,700
Princess Longyue should return to Yongshou Palace

271
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,500
No matter how close you are with Longyue,

272
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,500
it'll never be comparable to her biological mother

273
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,600
Yes

274
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,500
Sit

275
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh yes, where is Ning Guiren?

276
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,900
Why isn't she here today?

277
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,500
Reporting to Niangniang, she said she's unwell this morning

278
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,900
So she can't come

279
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,800
Since she's unwell

280
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,100
then ask the Royal Physicians to take good care of her

281
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Xi Fei, you're pregnant

282
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,900
You must take good care of your body

283
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Rest more and avoid moving around

284
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,500
Don't have to bother with too much of the rules

285
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,400
Thank you Niangniang

286
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,600
Xi Fei has Hongli and Longyue

287
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,000
Such bliss

288
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,400
Not everyone has it

289
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,300
Ok, that's all for today

290
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,800
You may all leave

291
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,400
Request to leave

292
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,400
Niangniang if you like these flowers

293
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,000
how about bringing some back and making them into a scented pouch?

294
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,300
I can't keep them forever anyway

295
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,100
even if I make them into scented pouches

296
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,500
They'll wilt anyway

297
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,500
Let it be

298
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,000
Greetings to Xi Fei

299
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,900
I've never seen this Meimei before

300
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,800
I am Ye Guiren

301
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,400
I've been sick this two days

302
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,100
so we haven't met

303
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,800
How did you know I'm Xi Fei?

304
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,100
Your return was famous

305
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,800
Who doesn't know?

306
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,600
I heard you're feeling sick

307
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,500
So why are you not resting in the Palace?

308
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,600
When the sun is harsher you'll feel more upset

309
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,500
Thank you for your concern

310
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,600
Why did you pluck so many petals?

311
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,700
Physician said

312
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,700
these silktree albizzia flowers are needed in my medicine

313
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,300
So I'm here to get some

314
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,700
It'll be a waste

315
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,100
if they just wilt and die

316
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,300
I am not ungrateful.

317
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,400
I'm not feeling too well.

318
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,100
I'm unable to talk to you anymore.

319
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,700
I'll make a move first.

320
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,500
How can she be so rude?

321
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
She's just taking advantage of the fact that the Emperor likes her.

322
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,300
No wonder the others say that she is recalcitrant.

323
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Niangniang.

324
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,000
I asked the kitchen to make a bowl

325
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,400
of soup to calm your nerves.

326
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,000
Please try it.

327
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,500
This soup's not too bad.

328
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,500
It's to help with the pregnancy and for my nerves.

329
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,500
Compared to other

330
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,100
bitter medicines this is much better.

331
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,500
Mistress, Concubine Hui is here!

332
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,300
Invite her in quickly!

333
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,200
I heard everything at the door!

334
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,200
Now that you're pregnant your appetite is sure to change.

335
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,000
I was just thinking of you, and here you are!

336
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,100
And green tea.

337
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I remember that

338
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,100
when you are pregnant you don't like greasy food.

339
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,100
Try it, quickly!

340
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,200
It's been so many years.

341
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,600
Sister's

342
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,900
I thought of it often outside.

343
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
If you like it,

344
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,200
I'll just make it for you everyday, and have it delivered!

345
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,100
Huan Er, I really never thought...

346
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,400
that we would be able to see each other again...

347
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,900
and talk.

348
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,900
Since I'm back, you should be happy.

349
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Of course I'm happy that you're back.

350
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,300
Maybe I shouldn't have told you about Uncle.

351
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,300
If you didn't tell me,

352
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,300
was I to sit back and watch my father die at Ningguta?

353
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,900
I understand.

354
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,500
How can people like us think of living for ourselves?

355
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,500
Family and clan.

356
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,600
None of them can remain unaffected by our actions.

357
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,100
Regardless of the reason,

358
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,600
it's good that we sisters can be together.

359
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,600
It's fortunate that Father has been brought back to the capital to be treated.

360
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,800
I can rest assured a little more too.

361
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,700
You have to be careful!

362
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,400
I know.

363
00:20:55,431 --> 00:20:57,870
But back to the topic at hand,

364
00:20:58,031 --> 00:21:01,081
it's better to have our own people in Qintianjian

365
00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:03,916
deputy Ji Wensheng of Qintianjian

366
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:05,961
works diligently

367
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,473
I think he's a usable talent.

368
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,770
that head sits there but has nothing to say

369
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:13,249
he should've taken time off long ago

370
00:21:13,323 --> 00:21:15,189
that's not difficult

371
00:21:15,268 --> 00:21:18,571
everyone eats, and gets sick

372
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,000
Liang Duorei, the head of Interior Office

373
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,000
has sent some fashionable cloths

374
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,100
let him in

375
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,700
Okay.

376
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,300
Gonggong, please

377
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,900
greetings to Xi Fei Niangniang and Hui Pin Niangniang

378
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,600
rise

379
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,800
Huangshang said that Xi Fei Niangniang picks first

380
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,500
from these newly tributes of Shu and Su silks

381
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,500
comes over, Xiaoyunzi

382
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,200
takes that greenish one to Ning Guiren

383
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,300
Bengong thinks she likes green

384
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,500
that color suits her well

385
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,600
Nucai withdrew

386
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,000
have you seen Ning Guiren?

387
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,000
yes, she's not like anyone

388
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,900
Xiaozhu forgot what she looked like before?

389
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,900
why sent her such good silk?

390
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,500
I thought only

391
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,300
what cloth would suit what person

392
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,900
this color suits her

393
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
that's why I had Xiaoyunzi sent it to her

394
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,400
you just saw her once

395
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,700
how could you see her as a foe?

396
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,900
Nubi don't like her unruliness

397
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,400
what she thought she is

398
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,200
why did you talk so much

399
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
it's only some silk

400
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,600
go to tell Ning Guiren, Xiaoyunzi

401
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,300
doesn't have to come to express her gratitude since it's so hot

402
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,400
Yes

403
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,100
I have to tell you

404
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,500
don't treat her too well

405
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Dowager is the first that doesn't like her

406
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,400
she's proud and aloof

407
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,800
no one gets along with her in the entire Harem

408
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,300
but Huangshang likes her

409
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,100
certain things one has to do

410
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,800
Mother, where are we going?

411
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Longyue, E Niang takes you to greet Xi Niangniang

412
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,000
is she the one that wore very pretty cloth?

413
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,700
Longyue is really smart, it is her

414
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,600
is she also Longyue's mother?

415
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,300
why didn't Longyue see her before?

416
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,300
Longyue, Xi Niangniang was not in the harem before

417
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,000
Longyue,

418
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,800
you should play with Xiangniang more

419
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300
Xi Niangniang really likes you

420
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,800
Xi Niangniang is pretty, Longyue likes her, too

421
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,300
but I still like E Niang the best

422
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Sister's embroidering is getting better

423
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,800
my child would insist Sister be the auntie

424
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,800
why don't you do a few more Dutou?

425
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,100
haven't I done enough for Longyue?

426
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,400
almost all her Dutou were made by Jing Fei and myself

427
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,700
if you give birth all your life

428
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,400
didn't I have to make cloth for you all my life?

429
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,200
you're so good at calculating this

430
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,400
Niangniang, Jing Fei with Princess Longyue are here

431
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,300
have them in, quickly

432
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,100
it's really cool here

433
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Yongshou Palace repaired in three months by someone sent by Huangshang

434
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,000
is really good

435
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,800
hurry Longyue, say

436
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,600
greetings to Xi Fei Niangniang

437
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,000
I couldn't say thanks yesterday because of so many people

438
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,000
see Sister today

439
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,200
grateful to Sister for so many years

440
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
of taking care of Longyue as you own

441
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,400
both of us are Fei

442
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,100
how could you bow to me like this?

443
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,700
if there were no Longyue with me these year

444
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,300
full of laughter and happiness

445
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,200
I couldn't imagine how my life would be

446
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,500
saw Cao Guiren and Qi Fei had child before

447
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
even Duan Fei later

448
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,100
had Princess Wenyi with her

449
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,500
I envied them so much

450
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,500
E Niang, wipe, Longyue'll be good

451
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,400
silly child, what E Niang or not

452
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,700
this Xi Fei Niangniang is your real E Niangniang

453
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,700
hurry, let E Niang hold you

454
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,200
good child, let your e niang kiss you

455
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,300
could e niang hold you?

456
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,700
let e niang hold

457
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,300
E Niang doesn't want me

458
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,500
Longyue, be good

459
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,900
how could e niang not want Longyue?

460
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,900
It's alright

461
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,600
Yuer is a good girl.

462
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,900
Come to Hui Niangniang's

463
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,800
Come.

464
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,200
Yuer is a good girl. Let me tell you

465
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,700
It's not that Consort Fei doesn't want you.

466
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,400
There is just another person to care for Longyue.

467
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,400
Is that alright?

468
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Look at how much Xi Niangniang cares for you.

469
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,700
E Niang also cares for Longyue.

470
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,900
Longyue, give E Niang a kiss okay?

471
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,100
You are not my E Niang.

472
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,800
Sister, Yue'r is still young.

473
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,500
You just returned to the palace

474
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
so she doesn't recognize you yet.

475
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,300
Niangniang, Empress Dowager is about to wake from her afternoon nap.

476
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,300
It's waiting outside YongShou palace.

477
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,400
You returned just yesterday.

478
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,300
Why don't you come with me to greet Empress Dowager?

479
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,200
Okay.

480
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,000
Yes, if you two sisters go

481
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,500
then you can watch over each other.

482
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,900
I will take my leave first.

483
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,300
E Niang don't leave me.

484
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,700
Yue'r is a good girl.

485
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,700
From now on

486
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,700
you need to live at YongShou palace.

487
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,500
You need to accompany your real mother.

488
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,600
I don't want to.

489
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,400
Since Xi Niangniang came

490
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,700
E Niang doesn't want me anymore

491
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,600
Why did Xi Niangniang come back?

492
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,857
Long Yue, how can you say such things?

493
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,400
Sister,

494
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,900
I have never taught Long Yue to say such words.

495
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,300
It's because the Emperor never let me talk about you in front of her.

496
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,300
I am just a consort.

497
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,300
The Emperor's decision to not tell her is right.

498
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,500
Longyue still doesn't understand.

499
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,800
Sister, don't be too heartbroken.

500
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,900
Although the Emperor had intentions to hide this fact

501
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,000
deep down he still cares for you.

502
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,000
Longyue, look at you.

503
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,800
You have angered your real mother.

504
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,700
Quickly apologize and say you were wrong.

505
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,000
Hurry.

506
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,500
Xi Niangniang don't be mad anymore.

507
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,100
Yue'r is admitting her wrongs.

508
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Xi Niangniang, don't be mad anymore.

509
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,800
Don't cry

510
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,800
It's my fault.

511
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,000
Suddenly asking her to call me E Niang.

512
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,400
I couldn't resist. Since she was three months old

513
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,000
we had never met again.

514
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,100
In the child's heart

515
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,500
she thinks of Jiejie as her mother.

516
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,200
To hear Longyue say E Niang

517
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,800
I don't know how to thank Jiejie.

518
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,400
Meimei, saying that makes us seem like strangers.

519
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,600
Don't cry.

520
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,100
Right now I am pregnant

521
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,500
and can't take care of Longyue.

522
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,500
So before I give birth

523
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,000
I need to ask Jiejie to take care of Longyue.

524
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,100
I don't know if Jiejie is willing to do this.

525
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,300
Since meimei places so much trust in me

526
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,100
there's no reason for me not to.

527
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,800
Even if it was for a lifetime I would be willing.

528
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,800
Meimei needs to rest well.

529
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,900
Huan'er is right.

530
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,900
Right now you're pregnant.

531
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,900
The doctors are saying that it is unstable.

532
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,000
You can't bump or jostle it.

533
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,700
Longyue is still young.

534
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,600
It would bad if you were bumped into.

535
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,100
Yes.

536
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Since it is like this

537
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,300
I will take Longyue to Xianfu palace.

538
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,600
It's getting late.

539
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,900
You two

540
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,900
should hurry and give your greetings to Empress Dowager.

541
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,900
We will leave first.

542
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,400
Let's go.

543
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,100
Why is Empress Dowager taking medicine first?

544
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,700
I should be feeding it to you.

545
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,400
You came just in time.

546
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,100
Beside your Aunt Su,

547
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,800
you serve me the most comfortably.

548
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,700
I give my greetings.

549
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,600
Wishing Empress Dowager good heath and good fortune for thousands of years.

550
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,100
You've returned.

551
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,100
Are you living well in Yongshou palace?

552
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,900
Yongshou palace is very luxurious.

553
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,600
I feel uneasy.

554
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,400
Although it's luxurious, the Emperor is affectionate.

555
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,200
It doesn't matter.

556
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
This medicine makes my tongue taste bitter.

557
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,300
Go dump it out.

558
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,100
I've always said the longer you live, the younger you become.

559
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,300
Yet you don't believe me.

560
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,900
You say that I'm coaxing you.

561
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,600
Now, you don't want to drink the medicine because it's bitter.

562
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,200
Throwing a child's tantrum.

563
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,200
Isn't that becoming younger as you live?

564
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,400
I've always seen you

565
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,100
as such a stable person.

566
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Now, you've learned to flatter.

567
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,800
The medicine is too bitter.

568
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,700
It was just to give Empress Dowager a laugh.

569
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,500
Here.

570
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,200
A pregnant lady is still kneeling.

571
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,700
Come help me rinse my mouth.

572
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,300
Yes.

573
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,800
Your ability to serve others has improved.

574
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
No wonder you've been at Ganlu Temple for so long

575
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,000
Causing the Emperor to think about you all the time.

576
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,200
The Empress Dowager has spoken very seriously. I am frightened.

577
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,000
Frightened?

578
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,400
And you are still frightened?

579
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,800
The Emperor came to Ganlu Temple because it had our memories.

580
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,800
I was very thankful.

581
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,500
Then I became pregnant.

582
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,600
The Emperor was thinking about the child's royal bloodline.

583
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,400
He didn't have the heart to leave the child.

584
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,500
So I came back.

585
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,300
In that case,

586
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,900
your meeting with the Emperor was a coincidence?

587
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,900
It wasn't a plot to gain the Emperor's favor again?

588
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,300
I don't dare lie to Empress Dowager.

589
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,600
Our meeting was not necessarily a coincidence.

590
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,100
Because at that time I just gave birth

591
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,900
and my health was not in the best condition.

592
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,000
When the Emperor didn't see me at Ganlu Temple

593
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,500
he thought I was still sick.

594
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,800
So he came to Ling Yunfeng to visit.

595
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,000
If this is the truth, then I have mistaken you.

596
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,200
It was because I wasn't able to explain this clearly to Empress Dowager.

597
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,800
It is my fault.

598
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,400
That day when you left the palace

599
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,800
you left your daughter.

600
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,500
Now, you've rekindled your feelings with the Emperor,

601
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,000
and have a child too.

602
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,900
Empress Dowager

603
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,500
I am speaking to her, why are you interrupting?

604
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,700
The Emperor is this country's ruler.

605
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,000
Not just mine.

606
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,000
On the political matters, although I am sad for my father

607
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,100
I would not hate the Emperor.

608
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,700
The day I left the palace

609
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,900
was because the Emperor treated me with no regards to our feelings.

610
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,500
But the Emperor came to see me.

611
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,200
I knew then that the Emperor wasn't heartless.

612
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,900
Today I was able to return.

613
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,500
I just want to peacefully serve the Emperor.

614
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,400
To repent for my wrongs.

615
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,300
You may rise.

616
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,400
Thank you.

617
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,500
I've always said that you are thoughtful.

618
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,400
How can you watch consort Xi kneel?

619
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
You didn't remind me to let her rise.

620
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,300
The illness is causing me to become muddled.

621
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,000
Did your brain become muddled too?

622
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,100
Empress Dowager, Consort Xi kneeling

623
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,700
is the same as your grandson kneeling.

624
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,000
The family is kneeling to give your their greetings.

625
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,600
Do I need to stop them?

626
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,000
Award her with a seat.

627
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,700
I gave birth to the Emperor.

628
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,500
I am afraid that he will have another Hu Mei by his side.

629
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,000
Now, you have a consort's title.

630
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,500
These clothes are too simple.

631
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,800
I have been meditating for a while, and I don't like luxuriant clothes.

632
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,000
For you to have such mature thoughts

633
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,900
it shows that my care for you all these years hasn't been wasted.

634
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,800
While I was at Ganlu Temple

635
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,400
thankfully I had your prayers.

636
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,200
I won't forget that so easily

637
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,700
Since you've returned

638
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,200
just pretend that this never happened.

639
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,300
I will tell the others about this too.

640
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,300
You need to remember it yourself.

641
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,300
With the three words Ganlu Temple

642
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,500
your future will be rough.

643
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,200
your future will be rough.

644
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,500
It's been four months right?

645
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,700
Yes.

646
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,400
The Emperor is aging.

647
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,700
But the people around him aren't striving to live quietly.

648
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,700
Now that you've returned

649
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,300
you should persuade the Emperor to take care

650
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,200
perhaps he will listen to your words.

651
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,100
I will adhere to your lecture.

652
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,100
I will not forget my duties as a consort.

653
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,100
You are smart and thoughtful.

654
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,100
You understand the meanings of my words the first time I say it.

655
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,200
Since we've gotten onto the topic of a consort's duties,

656
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
you must respect the Empress.

657
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,400
The Empress treats me very well.

658
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,100
I am very thankful to her.

659
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,200
That's good.

660
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,300
You are Consort Xi are like sisters

661
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,000
so now that she has her second child,

662
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,000
why don't you try harder?

663
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,000
I have always had my eye on you.

664
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,200
But you aren't willing to put effort onto the Emperor.

665
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,600
The Emperor doesn't even have someone who can give him advice.

666
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,600
How can I not worry?

667
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Yes. I understand.

668
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,800
You can't just understand, you must take action.

669
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,300
You two,

670
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,700
if you can stay by the Emperor's side and serve him well

671
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,100
then I will be able to relax.

672
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,500
Longyue distanced herself from me.

673
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,500
It's heartbreaking.

674
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,500
Don't blame Consort Jing or Longyue.

675
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,900
You can only blame the fact that the Emperor didn't tell Longyue

676
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,600
that you are her real birth mother.

677
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,600
Two years ago a serving girl accidentally revealed it,

678
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,700
saying that Longyue's mother was at Ganlu Temple.

679
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,500
The Emperor was so mad that he killed her.

680
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,300
Longyue doesn't want to leave Consort Jing.

681
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,200
Through these years

682
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,100
Consort Jing has really cared for Longyue.

683
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,100
Just now I saw how deep their mother-daughter relationship is.

684
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,800
Even if I force Longyue back to my side

685
00:38:16,013 --> 00:38:18,040
we will only grow more apart.

686
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,900
I am also worried that it would ruin the me and Consort Jing's long friendship.

687
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,700
As long as you understand.

688
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
The child is still young.

689
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,800
If you are nice to her, she will be nice to you.

690
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,400
No matter what, she is still your biological child.

691
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,300
Lower the sedan!

692
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,700
Hurry, lower it.

693
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,500
We are guilty.

694
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,100
We are guilty.

695
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,200
Huan'er, are you alright?

696
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
You clumsy thing.

697
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,600
Niangniang is on the sedan.

698
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,000
Are you so careless when you perform other tasks?

699
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
Be careful that I will tell the Imperial Household department

700
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,300
to cut off your heads.

701
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Niangniang have mercy.

702
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,000
How can you just suddenly trip?

703
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
Can't you even walk?

704
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,600
The stone path is originally easy to walk on.

705
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,500
But today, I don't know

706
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,300
how but there were some loose rocks.

707
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,700
So I slipped.

708
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,700
Niangniang.

709
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,900
Are you trying to trick me?

710
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,000
Is this the quickest path to return to Yongshou Palace?

711
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,400
Why would you go this way?

712
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,500
How would we have the guts to trick you?

713
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,700
Although this isn't the shortest path,

714
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,000
it's the coolest path to take in the summer.

715
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,500
Thankfully Niangniang is alright.

716
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,800
If there was some accident,

717
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,300
then even if we servants had a hundred heads

718
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,900
it wouldn't be enough to cut off.

719
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,900
Where is this place?

720
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,500
If you continue straight, it would be Imperial Concubine Qi's Chuxiu Palace.

721
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,300
Normally, unless it was specified

722
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,900
we go back using the original route that we came on.

723
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Today is especially hot.

724
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,400
It's understandable that they would choose this path.

725
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,700
It looks like someone is intentionally doing this.

726
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,100
I've only been back for two days.

727
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,100
And someone couldn't wait any longer.
