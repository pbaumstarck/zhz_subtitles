1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Episode 57

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:05,720
Niang Niang, you're back

3
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:08,187
His Majesty just came by. He heard
you went to say your greetings

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,675
to the Empress Dowager. He'll
come back again at night.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,100
I know

6
00:00:12,153 --> 00:00:16,611
You just had a scare. It's better to have
Doctor Wen take a look at you to be safe.

7
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,064
I'm fine.

8
00:00:18,064 --> 00:00:21,907
What happened? Both Niang Niang's
complexion don't look good.

9
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:23,967
Someone can't control their
behavior anymore. On our

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,025
way back, the servant
stepped on a pebble stone.

11
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,700
It made him slip, almost causing him
to drop Huan Er from the carriage

12
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,650
The carriage is so high.
If you had really

13
00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:33,914
fallen, you would have
certainly lost the baby.

14
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:35,039
Are you okay?

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,300
I'm fine

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,000
the pebbles were carefully
chosen, how could it be loose?

17
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:43,057
how did the poor quality pebbles get here?

18
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:46,308
someone must have done it

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,000
who?

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,500
must be her

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,000
if it is for the royal
lineage, it should be her

22
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,311
there are also others too

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,788
If there's a first time, there will
be a second time. A thrid time.

24
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:08,000
As long as Niang Niang is still
pregnant, they won't give up

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,800
it is not something we can prevent

26
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,138
Niang Niang, since his
Majesty is coming over at

27
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:18,000
night, you must tell him
about this incident.

28
00:01:18,831 --> 00:01:20,352
Xiao Yunzi

29
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:22,199
Where is that pebble stone
you picked up earlier?

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,400
Here it is.

31
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:27,193
find someone you can trust

32
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,800
and ask him about this pebble

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,700
Yes.

34
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:34,827
this doesn't look like
normal moss on the pebble

35
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,600
Yes.

36
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:42,793
Doesn't matter who. Since
they had the audacity to

37
00:01:42,806 --> 00:01:45,596
do this, don't blame me
for not letting them off

38
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,700
His Majesty is here.

39
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:02,009
greetings

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,188
Your Majesty, Our Niang
Niang is not feeling

41
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:06,300
well today. She's inside
sleeping right now.

42
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,300
Has the doctor been called to examine
her yet? Why didn't you tell me sooner?

43
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,400
Why are you not feeling well?
Your complexion looks so bad.

44
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,600
Your Majesty

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,400
Your Majesty

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,500
Just hold me like this, please?

47
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,900
ok?

48
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:27,415
Huan Bi

49
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,800
yes

50
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
your majesty

51
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,100
tell me

52
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,000
tell me, no one will scold you

53
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,300
my king

54
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,600
this afternoon

55
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
on our way home

56
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:43,577
my lady almost fell

57
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:45,309
from her sedan

58
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,600
and had a shock

59
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:50,721
how is it

60
00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:51,750
possible?

61
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:53,404
the path was slippery

62
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:57,325
where

63
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,572
near the Liuling Shizi road

64
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,481
that is supposed to be non-slippery road

65
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:06,122
I don't want to punish the servants

66
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:08,541
to settle this

67
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,700
You're suspicious that someone
wants to harm you, right?

68
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,807
How could I be?

69
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:15,348
I don't dare to think that way.

70
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:18,033
I just feel

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
my luck is down.

72
00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:23,091
You dote on me

73
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,100
and allow me to serve you

74
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,300
I may not have the good fortune

75
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,700
to keep my child

76
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,300
our child is very precious

77
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,800
today

78
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,300
Today's incident

79
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,000
isn't so simple

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,300
it is not the fault of the servants

81
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,600
Looks like someone can't stand that I
adore you so they purposely did this.

82
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,400
Su Peisheng

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,100
call the servants here

84
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,550
After the beating question them.

85
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,700
I won't forgive those who
bully the ones I love

86
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,700
yes

87
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,300
please wait

88
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,700
don't make it a big thing

89
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,200
even so

90
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,500
obviously there's someone who is
deliberately making things hard for you

91
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,480
if I don't punish now, what
should I do if it happens again

92
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,120
even if there is really someone
who wants to trouble me

93
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,800
please treat it as an accident

94
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,100
I don't wish

95
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,430
the palace to be in disarray
and for you to be worried.

96
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,200
If I don't punish anyone..
and this regards our child.

97
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,200
I feel uncomfortable

98
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,400
please take it as accumulating
fortune for our baby

99
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,800
ok

100
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,400
if it happens again

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,200
then punish the culprits

102
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,200
and

103
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,400
the servants are not at fault

104
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,800
forgive them

105
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,200
huan huan

106
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,400
you are very understanding

107
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,800
the king is still with her

108
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,900
he has not left yet

109
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:12,988
Niang Niang, go to bed first

110
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,699
she is pregnant, he can't stay for long

111
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:18,907
even so

112
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,000
he wants to keep her company

113
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:24,329
ai..

114
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,500
your pulse is weak.

115
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:48,091
Niangniang must not be eating
or sleeping well these days.

116
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
if I am not here

117
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,757
you wouldn't let Cai Yue ask for me?

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,300
she had a shock yesterday

119
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,500
I was worried, but I didn't
have a solid reason.

120
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,700
she didn't eat well

121
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,700
my health is alright

122
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,800
even if you don't take care of your health

123
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:12,564
I can't let you remain like this

124
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,200
if you don't eat well

125
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:16,403
you will spoil your appetite

126
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:17,207
and hurt your body

127
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
and hurt your body.

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,300
Thankfully it's just because I am
thinking to much and not eating enough.

129
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,900
you will be worried if it is HuanEr

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,846
it is

131
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,300
normal that I worry

132
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:34,912
Can't I worry?

133
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,300
Niangniang's heath is important.

134
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:43,511
I will return to the hospital

135
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,700
and write a prescription for you

136
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:47,280
I take my leave

137
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,500
you are tired

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,200
I will pour tea for you

139
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,500
I've already asked.

140
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,050
What is it?

141
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,500
They said that the pebbles are
unique to specific areas.

142
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,900
This is niumaoxian

143
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:28,226
it grows by short fir trees

144
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,200
mostly found as bonsai in the palace

145
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:33,293
where Zhuxiu court and the place
where Lady Qibin and Lady Xin stays

146
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,200
Lady Xin is pitiful after serving
the king for so many years

147
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,200
And she's only a Precious.

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,188
That Imperial Concubine Pin.
She hates us so

149
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:43,400
much she would want us
to get eaten by crows.

150
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,500
Maybe Precious Xin is helping.

151
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,420
Miss, why didn't you strike
while it was hot last night?

152
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,500
I wasn't harmed.

153
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,230
Even if the Emperor found the culprit
he wouldn't severely punish them.

154
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,070
I'll leave it be.

155
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,700
Then when something big
happens that will be better.

156
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
greetings

157
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,700
Ladies QiBin and Xin are here

158
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,100
to visit you

159
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,500
Lead them to the formal room.

160
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:13,448
I will meet them

161
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,300
greetings

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,700
to my lady

163
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:24,081
take a seat

164
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,100
we haven't met for some years

165
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,900
you looked good Lady Qi

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,300
you looked young too

167
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,900
no one can tell you stayed at a temple

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,800
really

169
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,880
Back when we lived together at Suiyu Xuan

170
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,200
we were friends last time

171
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,300
it has been 3 years

172
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,900
our fathers were friends too

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
But then suddenly someone
stabbed him in the back.

174
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,900
It seems that people's attitudes
change faster than their appearances.

175
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,100
you have the gift of the gap

176
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,100
and change black to white

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,428
In order for you to come
back, the Emperor was

178
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:10,880
willing to change his
flag into a Man flag.

179
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,750
It's not difficult.

180
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,330
At least it's not as scary as someone's
heart turning from white to black.

181
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,900
I thought Lady Qi respect you

182
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,500
She even wore the Empress's
gift of red jade to see you.

183
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,060
Who knew that when she spoke
it would still be so biting.

184
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,850
It's been years since I've
seen you, Precious Xin.

185
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,800
my lady

186
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,600
We are reuniting

187
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,900
so don't speak so formally.

188
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,070
Thank you for thinking of me.

189
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,600
sure you are

190
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,000
one is a lady

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
the other suffered for many
years an is only a Precious.

192
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,800
you came

193
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,500
to greet me

194
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,000
Lady Qi you are the lead today

195
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
if you quarrel it will look bad

196
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,500
you are an understanding person

197
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:07,526
but this court is meant for you only

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,900
if anyone else can take your place

199
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,900
that would have taken a few
generations of fortune to achieve

200
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,800
I see

201
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,500
Lady Xin

202
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,240
How difficult is that?

203
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,600
I will save you your time

204
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,100
to act

205
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,400
Lady Qi

206
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:38,070
do you know that this court

207
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,700
is assigned to Lady Xi
by the king personally

208
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,000
for her alone

209
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,200
who do you think you are that the

210
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,800
king should retract his edict?

211
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,000
I am uncomfortable, I will take my leave

212
00:10:54,215 --> 00:10:55,118
excuse me

213
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,200
see

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
she is very rude

215
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,700
do you know how much I suffered under her?

216
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:10,549
it has been some years

217
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,300
your life has not been smooth sailing

218
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,400
since I shifted there

219
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,500
she has give me trouble

220
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,900
though I came earlier, her
rank is higher than mine

221
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,100
why don't you ask to shift out

222
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,300
Lady Qi is well liked by her majesty

223
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,500
if she prevents me from
leaving, how can I leave

224
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,000
I spoke with the king

225
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,100
he told me off

226
00:11:47,598 --> 00:11:50,157
Since Gui Ren is already here

227
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:52,629
these words

228
00:11:54,194 --> 00:11:55,710
If you have something to say

229
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,800
Gui Ren might as well say it directly.

230
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,700
Niangniang thinks and speaks fast.

231
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,400
I really can't stand her anymore.

232
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,300
you want me to

233
00:12:05,777 --> 00:12:09,014
ask the king to let you shift out

234
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,900
yes

235
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:14,793
that is my wish

236
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,100
you have guts

237
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:19,133
these years spent at the temple

238
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,000
I've eaten simple meals for too long.

239
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,917
it is better to have less problems

240
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:25,072
it is better to have less problems

241
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:27,715
I have no

242
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:30,205
one to help me

243
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:32,035
my family is far away

244
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:35,396
since you are back

245
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,300
in glory

246
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,100
you must have suffered too.

247
00:12:39,152 --> 00:12:42,027
I am willing to help you

248
00:12:42,784 --> 00:12:46,218
I understand your heart

249
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,200
I don't wish to fight any battle

250
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:52,508
Some people are provoking me

251
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:54,533
so I am willing to get involved

252
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,800
with your status

253
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,900
you can do anything

254
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,000
since you are back

255
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,300
you can't keep away from the politics

256
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,400
I came today and

257
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,900
if you are concerned about my sincerity

258
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,900
you can spend time thinking through

259
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,700
I will think about it

260
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,200
Xiao Lingzi

261
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:23,767
please bring the short fir tree here

262
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,400
yes

263
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,871
I know you like the fir trees

264
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,500
I asked them to bring it for you

265
00:13:32,914 --> 00:13:34,790
including the pebbles

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
see if you like it

267
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,100
yes

268
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,000
the niumaoxian's colour is beautiful

269
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,700
It must be something from
Niangniang's palace.

270
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,200
PeiEr, keep it

271
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:55,022
yes

272
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:58,716
as long as you like it

273
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,300
it can't compare to

274
00:14:01,677 --> 00:14:03,353
the beads on your neck Lady QiBin

275
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,362
it was given by the queen

276
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:09,190
she wears it daily

277
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,986
to show off

278
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:15,634
it is very good

279
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:17,263
smell good too

280
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:19,909
very light and good smell

281
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,500
then that is a good thing

282
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,900
I seen through Lady Xin

283
00:14:35,378 --> 00:14:38,355
she went to tell tales

284
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:41,239
as if I bullied her

285
00:14:44,304 --> 00:14:46,955
since you are higher rank than her

286
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,700
you should put her in her place

287
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:52,106
or else she may become worst

288
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,400
she thought Lady Xi will look after her

289
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:59,477
she came back because of her pregnancy

290
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,692
do you believe them?

291
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,400
5% yes, 5% no

292
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,500
I can't tell what is the truth
when I gave her the short fir tree

293
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:14,742
looks innocent

294
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:16,314
she stayed here long even to learn to act

295
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
have you spoken to PeiEr?

296
00:15:20,368 --> 00:15:23,208
yes, she missed you

297
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,500
Wait for me to ask her and
then we'll make a decision

298
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,100
The more I think about
it, the angrier I am.

299
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,000
Did she forget about when she used to
kiss up to you with every opportunity?

300
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,400
you think she is stupid?

301
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,900
she knew that our relationship was deeper.

302
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,300
she is only acting in front of me

303
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:50,396
if I can't help her, definitely
the queen won't either

304
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,500
so she would rather

305
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,600
turn her tables with me

306
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,700
if there is no child, there
is no way out for us

307
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
why do you say that

308
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:08,997
did you see the beads Lady QiBin wore

309
00:16:09,054 --> 00:16:11,055
The Hongmannao beads?

310
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:11,999
No matter what she has

311
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,700
don't we have it too

312
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:17,046
that is rare

313
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:18,909
Hongshe fragrant beads.

314
00:16:18,972 --> 00:16:21,482
this looks like Hongmannao

315
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,300
so rare that

316
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:24,943
there are only few in the palace

317
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,100
I heard from Lady Xin

318
00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:32,098
that the bead gave off a sweet smell

319
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,088
It is made from Jixiong.
If you wear it for long,

320
00:16:36,101 --> 00:16:39,200
it affects your health
so you can't give birth.

321
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,500
why did she wear it then?

322
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,030
Does no no tell her?

323
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,660
It's rare so normal people
can't distinguish it. Also,

324
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:54,097
didn't you hear

325
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,500
the queen gave it to her

326
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,300
even if the doctors know

327
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,900
no one dares to tell her

328
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,900
go to the kitchen

329
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,800
to see if the food for Lungyue is ready

330
00:17:07,884 --> 00:17:10,138
I don't know if she likes the food

331
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,100
Lungyue left you when she was young

332
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,900
she will be distanced from you

333
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,400
it will be better after
you spent time together

334
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,100
I hope so

335
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:25,179
Here Princess. Eat.

336
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:27,886
Good girl. Princess.

337
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:30,523
Here. Let me feed her.

338
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:32,806
Come, Longyue.

339
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:35,500
Let's eat.

340
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:39,068
Here. One bite.

341
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,000
Good girl.

342
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,700
Good. Eat some more. Princess still
listens to Niang Niang afterall

343
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:47,283
Look how well she eats.

344
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:50,840
Niangniang

345
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:53,393
greetings

346
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:54,838
Niangniang is eating?

347
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,442
we made some food

348
00:17:58,882 --> 00:18:00,299
hope the princess likes them

349
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:02,873
It looks wonderful.

350
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,976
she is having her meal now

351
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,400
Then I'll excuse myself first.

352
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
Okay.

353
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,800
lets eat more vegetables.

354
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,400
yes

355
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,200
Good girl.

356
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,800
The Emperor is always thinking of you.

357
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:37,119
grow the lotus in the large pots

358
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,700
so you can see them growing here

359
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,300
lotus has a nice smell

360
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,500
it is easy to attract insects

361
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Lady, is it the lotus
flower you don't like,

362
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,000
or is it the person who arranged
these flowers that you don't like?

363
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,800
this year's

364
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:06,238
birthday, I saw many lotus

365
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:09,722
Later the people did this

366
00:19:10,194 --> 00:19:12,522
whatever others do now,
is just a shadow of it

367
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,300
PeiEr is here

368
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:17,691
invite her in

369
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,300
yes

370
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,700
stand up

371
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:35,409
thank you

372
00:19:37,604 --> 00:19:39,257
look at you

373
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:44,403
I am not fortune

374
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,600
I can't serve you

375
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,200
I heard from Lady Xin

376
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,200
I had to come and pay respect to you

377
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,500
so I followed her

378
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,000
I heard JuQing has died

379
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,700
what happened?

380
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,700
when you left, AnPing said

381
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,000
JuQing died of a stomach disease.

382
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:07,085
I took a peak

383
00:20:09,284 --> 00:20:10,642
her blood were all black

384
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:12,362
it means she died of poisoning

385
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,800
JuQing served Lady AnBin

386
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,300
she originally served me

387
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
But when I left...

388
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
it is a pity

389
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,800
if Lady Xin doesn't treat you well

390
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,900
tell me

391
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:28,659
thank you

392
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,310
After Niangniang left I was
assigned to Precious Xin's place.

393
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,280
So I went with her to ChuXiu Palace.

394
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,160
But ChuXiu Palace's master
is Imperial Concubine Qi.

395
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,000
She hates that I served you before.

396
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Lady QiBin scolds and beat me up

397
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,050
Go get the medicine.

398
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:49,190
Yes.

399
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:53,302
when I left

400
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:56,015
I can't do much for you

401
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,986
I am already fortune to work for you

402
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,300
to others people we

403
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,900
are invaluable servants.

404
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,400
I am of low status, how can I
have Niangniang do these things.

405
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,300
bear with it

406
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,000
bear with it

407
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:25,460
didn't she speak up for you

408
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,499
when Lady Xin sees Lady
QiBin scold or beat us

409
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:31,191
she will speak up

410
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,100
only that made

411
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Lady QiBin more angry

412
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,820
The head of the palace can
punish anyone in the palace

413
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,680
even if PeiEr is Precious
Xin's she can't protect her.

414
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,000
so it is real that they can't get along?

415
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,400
yes

416
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,400
I understand you

417
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,484
if you are not happy

418
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:05,750
I will ask you to serve me

419
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:09,409
you know that

420
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,469
do you want to help me

421
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:15,421
keep an eye on them

422
00:22:15,914 --> 00:22:17,835
yes

423
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,700
king

424
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,200
the Jinshifang staff are here

425
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,800
I have not met Lady Xin for some time

426
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,900
King is here

427
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,500
King is here

428
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,800
greetings

429
00:22:49,047 --> 00:22:50,151
come

430
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,200
don't run after me

431
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,500
what is that

432
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,100
Lady QiBin has her nightmares again

433
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:13,683
king

434
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,121
please visit her

435
00:23:16,755 --> 00:23:18,397
don't come

436
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,200
I will go and visit her

437
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,300
I will go and visit her

438
00:23:24,008 --> 00:23:27,958
are you coming back

439
00:23:28,836 --> 00:23:30,292
I wanted to visit you

440
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:33,005
I will be back

441
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,100
I had a nightmare again

442
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,100
my heart is still racing.

443
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,700
I feel scared

444
00:23:47,822 --> 00:23:49,571
look at you

445
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:51,451
why don't you consult a doctor

446
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:53,128
about it

447
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:56,083
I did

448
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,300
he said the YinQi is strong here

449
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,600
then only

450
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,400
I have strong YangQi (positive energy)

451
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,900
is it?

452
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:07,211
of course

453
00:24:07,252 --> 00:24:08,997
you can stand up to any negative energy

454
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:10,195
you can stand up to any negative energy

455
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,700
come here

456
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,300
why didn't you stop him

457
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:24,317
he won't be back

458
00:24:24,939 --> 00:24:26,966
every time he came, she had a nightmare

459
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,400
every time he came, she had a nightmare

460
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,300
I knew it

461
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,000
I can't block him if I wanted to.

462
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,500
I tried to stop him before

463
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,300
really? <br> Precious Xin
doesn't have much favor.

464
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,300
Lady Xin can't keep the
King with her last night

465
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,810
Then the Empress or Consort
Jing don't do anything?

466
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,710
Consort Jing has a bit of reputation

467
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,700
she can't say much about it

468
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,670
With Empress, she only thinks
it's two consorts being jealous.

469
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,570
She doesn't say much.

470
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:18,859
what

471
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:21,681
I heard

472
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:22,887
that they are working to
path a way for the future

473
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,093
Xiao Yunxzi

474
00:25:26,116 --> 00:25:28,873
since Lady QiBin always have nightmares

475
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,300
cook some brown rice and
barley soup for her

476
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,900
cook some brown rice and
barley soup for her

477
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,300
since her nightmare is bad

478
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:37,750
there is no need to cook it
until it is fully soften

479
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,500
as long as it is boiled that should be fine

480
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:44,702
give her personally in front of the king

481
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,700
yes

482
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,700
let her finish it

483
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
-I will go and prepare.
<br>-You seem to dislike her

484
00:25:52,395 --> 00:25:53,653
you seems to dislike her

485
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,400
your lady can't keep the king with her

486
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,200
why did you splash water here

487
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,100
are you still frighten

488
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,400
If you don't come, I am always frightened.

489
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,700
let me listen

490
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
I have something for Lady QiBin

491
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,900
what is it?

492
00:26:40,323 --> 00:26:42,450
This is good for preventing nightmares

493
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,000
drink it

494
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,800
I don't want to

495
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:50,767
if I drink, you won't come

496
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,772
these are different matters

497
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:58,127
this is good for you

498
00:26:58,186 --> 00:27:00,481
drink it

499
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,100
take it away

500
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
if you don't drink, it
means you are not sick

501
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,800
so you have buff me all along

502
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,900
Niangniang said that you must drink it all.

503
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,600
Why are you angry with Lady QiBin

504
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,400
she is just such a person

505
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,400
she is overboard at times
although she is still cute to me

506
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,900
you think you can allow
her to behave this way

507
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,600
you didn't know

508
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,900
that others in the palace
will learn to be like her

509
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,520
With that kind of attitude there
will be a lot of resentment.

510
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,080
And Imperial Concubine's becomes
arrogant when she gains favor.

511
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,620
If one palace is unsteady then
the entire harem is unsteady.

512
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,000
this will create problems in the long run

513
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,800
I see your point

514
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:41,170
just as you say

515
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,900
I should teach her a lesson

516
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,300
then this will comfort Lady Xin

517
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,238
Since this matter, no one dares
to be arrogant. . After hearing

518
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:58,000
this, Tai Hou was delighted and
couldn't stop praising you.

519
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,300
The Empress Dowager knows too?

520
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,300
Who doesn't know in the He Palace?

521
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,200
Lady Xi is very imposing,

522
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:08,299
just like that you stopped
the harem's bad atmosphere.

523
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,400
At first, Tai Hou doubted you,
but now she can be relieved.

524
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,500
You wouldn't know how this
made things difficult for me

525
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,046
if it wasn't for using
Lady Qi as an example.

526
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,188
It's inevitable for Tai
Hou to doubt me because

527
00:29:20,201 --> 00:29:22,200
she's scared that I
bewitched the emperor

528
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,700
Now that I've made a
move and made it known,

529
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:24,800
someone will hate
me like an eyesore.

530
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,600
Now more people will make me their target.

531
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,100
Making Tai Hou happy is the most important.

532
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,100
In Tai Hou's eyes,

533
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,822
these are only petty tactics.

534
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,500
Even then, the harem's bad atmosphere

535
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,500
will never be kept under control.
It just weakened a bit.

536
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,200
I can't even walk properly
after having such bad luck

537
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,300
stepping into mud.

538
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,500
Don't be mad, it will harm your health.

539
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,100
Xin Precious is usually quiet,

540
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,900
now she complains in front of other people.

541
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,300
It's really true that a dog
that bites doesn't bark.

542
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,700
I got bitten by a dog,
of course I'm unlucky.

543
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,288
Please bear with it for
now, even the Emperor

544
00:30:05,301 --> 00:30:07,900
is siding with Xin Precious
helping Xi Consort.

545
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,800
What is Xi Consort?

546
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,600
Taking advantage that the Emperor's still
giving few glances at her bewitching face,

547
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,400
she comes and humiliate me

548
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
and he doesn't look at what she is.

549
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,238
Not only was she not
behaving in the Bhuddist

550
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:20,100
Temple , she even goes
and seduce the Emperor

551
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
She thinks that being pregnant is all that,

552
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,700
I need to let her know how powerful I am.

553
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:27,323
I don't know how powerful you are,

554
00:30:27,323 --> 00:30:30,121
I just know that the walls have ears.

555
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,700
Lady Qi, just take good care of yourself.

556
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,300
Having such skill at cursing others,

557
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,500
why not drink a few more
brown rice barley soup

558
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,200
to cure the problem with your nightmares.

559
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,300
It was Xi Consort,

560
00:30:43,317 --> 00:30:45,071
it was Xi Consort!

561
00:30:45,597 --> 00:30:47,798
Shh, don't make a sound Lady!

562
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,200
Mother

563
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,300
you're not mad?

564
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,300
Always remember that with unworthy
people and unworthy matters

565
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,200
do not waste your time
and energy with them.

566
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,000
Yes.

567
00:31:21,106 --> 00:31:23,534
An important guest has arrived, forgive me.

568
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:25,602
Sorry for my lack of manners.

569
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,300
It's been many years. Duan
jiejie's coloring looks well.

570
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,300
Thank you, this way please.

571
00:31:42,629 --> 00:31:43,957
With Wenyi,

572
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,100
these slow days pass quicker.

573
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,358
Or else living one year after another,

574
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,300
I wouldn't have anything
to look forward to.

575
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,500
Jiejie has such good fortune.

576
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,400
My Longyue doesn't bother with me.

577
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Consort Jing cares for Longyue
as much as I care for Wenyi.

578
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,700
She's been brought up by her.

579
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,300
Longyue will be closer to her.

580
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,200
Recently Consort Jing has been anxious.

581
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,500
That said,

582
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,800
if Imperial Concubine Xiang came
back and wanted to take Wenyi

583
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,400
I would also not want to.

584
00:32:27,968 --> 00:32:29,099
I understand

585
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,800
Jin Consort,

586
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,600
is an understanding person, <br> but
even an understanding person

587
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,100
cannot control her feelings

588
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,127
let alone it's the love between
a mother and daughter.

589
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,100
When you weren't in the
palace, you didn't know。

590
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,308
That year,

591
00:32:46,323 --> 00:32:48,676
Long Yue was sick

592
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,600
she didn't sleep for days and night.

593
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,500
If at that time, she couldn't save Long Yue

594
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,500
she would've been sad to death.

595
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,400
As a mother,

596
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:04,014
I indeed did not put any
effort into being a mother.

597
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,600
How can I dare to ask Long
Yue to be close with me?

598
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,350
I only hope

599
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,660
that she can acknowledge me as her mother.

600
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,700
When talking about a mother's care,

601
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,200
Even I feel wronged listening to you.

602
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,788
At that time, you left
the palace after giving

603
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:21,700
birth to Long Yue after
only three days.

604
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,300
In those three days

605
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,800
everything you did was to make
sure she had a good future.

606
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,280
But I still need to advise you one thing.

607
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,400
Don't try to rush Longyue
into accepting you.

608
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,750
Even though you want to be with your child,

609
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,900
you must be patient.

610
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,000
You came back to the palace
under a different identity.

611
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,100
Don't get so involved with Imperial
Concubine Wan of Zhen's daughter.

612
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,500
That way you can avoid gossip.

613
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,890
Jiejie's words I will remember.

614
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,700
Okay. Look how how you are.

615
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,700
Mother will take you to Qianli pond okay?

616
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,000
Okay

617
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,300
Meimei,

618
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,300
Longyue, give your greetings to Consort Xi.

619
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,100
Greetings, Consort Xi.

620
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,700
Let mother take you to play, okay?

621
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,600
I don't want to.

622
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,100
Longyue is still in the mode to
play and doesn't want to be hugged.

623
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,600
Just for that sentence

624
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,500
to make her go live with meimei,

625
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,900
she threw a tantrum for an entire day.

626
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,300
Why don't we let her live at
Xianfu palace for a few more days?

627
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,800
What is jiejie saying?

628
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:58,999
Of course your child shall live with you.

629
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
I just wanted to bring
her to play for a bit.

630
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,500
Oh, we wanted to go to Qianli
pond to feed the fish.

631
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,100
Meimei why don't you come along?

632
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,300
I still have some things to attend to.
You should play with Longyue.

633
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,500
Longyue, say goodbye to your mother.

634
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,800
Niangniang isn't mad?

635
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,600
Why should I be mad?

636
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,500
Another person to dote on the
princess is a good thing.

637
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
But Consort Jing has forgotten who
Longyue's birth mother really is.

638
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,600
Just now, Consort Jing wanted Niangniang

639
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:45,570
to go feed the fish with the princess.

640
00:35:45,615 --> 00:35:47,574
If Niangniang went,
wouldn't that have been a

641
00:35:47,587 --> 00:35:49,557
good opportunity to get
closer to the princess?

642
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,910
If Consort Jing wanted me to go she
would have asked me from the start.

643
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,690
It's for them to get closer.

644
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,060
If I went,

645
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,900
who knows how much drama it would cause.

646
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,000
I am not interested.

647
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,900
Consort Jing isn't wrong.

648
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,400
Longyue's birth mother is of the
Zhen family. I am of Nuhu lu family.

649
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,400
What birth mother?

650
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,200
Jiejie.

651
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,300
Greetings.

652
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,700
It's been long, meimei became a Precious.

653
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,000
Jiejie is the real Precious.

654
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,600
I thought that jeijei would flit around
the outside and live a lonely life.

655
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,700
It made me sad.

656
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,080
But now the tables have turned.

657
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,110
There's never a perfect time and place.

658
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,000
There is always something unsatisfactory.

659
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,550
Even if meimei becomes
an Imperial Concubine

660
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,520
there will be a time when
your life is unsteady.

661
00:36:54,326 --> 00:36:56,457
After jeijei left, I had to take
care of the Emperor for so long.

662
00:36:56,478 --> 00:36:58,507
I served the Emperor for so long

663
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,700
But I don't have a child.

664
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,200
I have bad luck.

665
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,900
But your own daughter

666
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,150
became someone else's child.

667
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,500
How do you feel?

668
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:16,300
Longyue hasn't been with me. Of
course she isn't as close to me.

669
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,500
But I believe

670
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,700
that a person will have gains and loses.

671
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,600
Compared to meimei

672
00:37:25,008 --> 00:37:27,195
the child in my stomach

673
00:37:27,237 --> 00:37:29,831
perhaps will have more fortune.

674
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,300
I am just afraid that you will
lose more fortune than you gain.

675
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,310
Meimei's words are truthful.

676
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,830
But compared to so me people,

677
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,720
they try their hardest, but manage
to lose other people's trust.

678
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,190
I'm afraid that in the end

679
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,090
they use a bamboo basket to
carry water and it's empty.

680
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,650
Jiejie is completely right.

681
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,590
Actually when you were by
ChuXiu Palace and almost fell,

682
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,510
I heard about the incident.

683
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,700
Thankfully jiejie is alright.

684
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,800
I am relieved for you.

685
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:03,161
Putting her at ChuXiu Palace,

686
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,800
Precious Xin serves the Emperor more.

687
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:08,046
Her attitude becomes more bold.

688
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,100
You honestly think it's Precious Xin?

689
00:38:10,637 --> 00:38:12,463
Jiejie please think about it.

690
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,600
In ChuXiu Palace

691
00:38:14,994 --> 00:38:16,792
who has the longest grudge against you?

692
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,600
Her father is her father.

693
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,000
She has never done anything to me.

694
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,300
Jiejie is kind hearted.

695
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,194
She has always wanted to replace you.

696
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:29,590
Jiejie, why don't you understand?

697
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:31,944
She is the Empress's favorite person.

698
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,720
How can you say such things

699
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,000
behind her back without evidence?

700
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,680
Before I've done too many wrong things.

701
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,900
I've seen other people
make many bad choices too.

702
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,600
Some things I originally
wanted to bring up again.

703
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,400
But you just came back and was sabotaged.

704
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
How can I continue hiding anything?

705
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,500
The mistakes in the past are already over.

706
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,900
I hope that today I can
compensate it a little bit.

707
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,300
I don't know when to listen to your words.

708
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,100
In the Emperor's mind

709
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,700
you are the quietest and warm hearted.

710
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
So,

711
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,100
you have done shameful things in the past?

712
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,800
Your words imply that you
don't want to forgive me.

713
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,000
I really don't know how to tell the
people's hearts in this palace.

714
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,500
But Lingrong

715
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,200
we have been sisters for all these years.

716
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,200
I cannot repay for the crimes
I've committed in this lifetime.

717
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,700
I hope that you can
safely deliver your baby.

718
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,300
You must be very careful.

719
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,800
It's so fragrant.

720
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,600
This is a gift from Precious Xin.

721
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,100
Do you like this scent?

722
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,600
I understand your intentions.

723
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,500
I will be careful.
