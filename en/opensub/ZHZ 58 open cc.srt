1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Episode 58

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,700
No need to follow. I will serve her.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,300
Understood.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,300
Speak your mind.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,100
She was only pretending to be nice just now,

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,700
don't tell me you are willing to trust her again!

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,000
Why shouldn't I believe her?

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,700
I saw clearly just now

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,100
insider her satchel was--

10
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:26,984
If you know what's in her satchel

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,300
then you must also know what she intends to do.

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,500
What she said today may not have all been false,

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,500
there is a semblance of truth.

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,500
Jin Xi,

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,700
Niang niang.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,100
You saw Su Peisheng, what did he say?

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:49,700
What did he say?

18
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,900
He said,

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,600
Qi Pin and An Pin

20
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:54,142
are now in the Empress's camp.

21
00:00:54,193 --> 00:00:57,086
But they have only ever been friends for show.

22
00:00:57,126 --> 00:01:00,147
Lately the Empress favours Qi Pin,

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,900
An Pin can't help but feel neglected.

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,400
Qi Pin is shallow and loves to flaunt

25
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:09,613
If I was the Empress,

26
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,400
I would also view her as the more controllable one.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,900
An Ling-Rong is vicious and skilled at manipulation

28
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,000
She and the Empress are of the same persuasion.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,600
Most likely not even the Empress

30
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,600
can fully control her.

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,200
These infidels are in league with each other<br>(Lit. A den of snakes and mice)

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,000
but still can't keep away from internal strife.

33
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,000
Serves them right.

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,300
Young Mistress, what do you plan to do?

35
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,500
Since An Ling Rong came specifically to inform

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,600
I may as well accept her gift.

37
00:01:37,676 --> 00:01:38,632
Huan Bi,

38
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,292
Go tell Pei Er

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,000
let Xin Guiren know.

40
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,000
Understood.

41
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,700
Consort, <br> His majesty is coming tonight

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Should we start preparing?

43
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,876
Prepare for what?

44
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,000
Xiao Yun-Zi told me earlier that

45
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,100
the Princess was very unaccustomed to you.

46
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,400
It's understandable that you are angry with His Majesty.

47
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,700
He is the culprit.

48
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,500
Your Majesty, please have some lotus seed soup

49
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,900
it's especially good for the summer heat.

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,100
Have you sent someone to Consort Xi?

51
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,800
Is she feeling better?

52
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,700
Still the same,

53
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,800
melancholic as always.

54
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,000
Your Majesty, even if Xi Fei Niangniang can take it

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,300
bear it,

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,700
the child in her can't.

57
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:37,116
I am not settled either.

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,500
Arrange for some entertaining performances

59
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,300
to cheer her up.

60
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,900
But Your Majesty, that's not what Niangniang desires the most

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,300
It won't be effective.

62
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,900
She will not be happy.

63
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,500
Then, what do you suggest I do?

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,600
Niangniang is alone in the palace and must miss her family,

65
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,100
but the Princess won't be close with her,

66
00:02:56,204 --> 00:02:59,344
Your Majesty, why not arrange for a meeting with her other family members?

67
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,900
Perhaps seeing them will cheer her and disperse her unhappiness

68
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,200
then she may get better.

69
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:07,083
I know what to do.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,400
Zhen Yuan-Dao hasn't yet fully recovered from his illness,

71
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,700
I am afraid he might infect Xi Fei if they meet.

72
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,500
I will naturally allow them a meeting

73
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,700
when Zhen Yuan-Dao has recovered.

74
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

75
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,700
His Majesty has arrived.

76
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

77
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,700
Rise.

78
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,245
Thank you, Your Majesty.

79
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,700
You are finally feeling better today?

80
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

81
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,600
Su Gonggong said

82
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,300
Your Majesty has permitted my father to visit me after he recovers.

83
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,400
I feel much better hearing that.

84
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:54,278
Right now I have no other wish than

85
00:03:54,328 --> 00:03:56,525
for my family to be safe and sound

86
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,500
and to give Your Majesty a son.

87
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,600
Niangniang's family is also His Majesty's family,

88
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,500
they are important to Him too.

89
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:06,590
Niangniang can rest assured.

90
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,700
Your Majesty, Jing Shi Fang inquired earlier

91
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,600
whether you would like to flip a card tonight.

92
00:04:13,947 --> 00:04:16,278
No need, I will stay here.

93
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:17,322
Yes.

94
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
You Majesty, have you forgotten the imperial doctor's advice again?

95
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,000
It is good just to be in your company.

96
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,811
I wouldn't want Your Majesty to feel denied,

97
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,400
and ask that Your Majesty not tease me either.

98
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,200
It's probably best to go elsewhere.

99
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,000
Then...

100
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,400
Chun Xi Dian.

101
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Yes.

102
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,300
I will go and inform Ning Guiren to prepare.

103
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:42,866
But Qi Pin will be muttering again

104
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:45,489
when I pass by Chu Xiu Gong.

105
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,100
Oh? Do they often gossip about my attentiveness to Ning Guiren?

106
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,400
That I love Lady Ning too much?

107
00:04:50,614 --> 00:04:51,948
I can't say often,

108
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:54,981
I just happened to overhear a few times.

109
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,100
You can't really blame Qi Pin.

110
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,000
The Empress Dowager isn't fond of Ning Guiren,

111
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,700
much less the others.

112
00:05:00,895 --> 00:05:02,286
The Empress Dowager is the Empress Dowager.

113
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,100
Who does she think she is?

114
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,500
Qi Pin is only jealous.

115
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,000
It's such a hot day, please do not let anger affect your health.

116
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,100
Your Majesty,

117
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:17,378
Chu Xiu Gong sent someone to say that Qi Pin feels unwell

118
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:19,546
will Your Majesty visit her?

119
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,700
If she's unwell then send for a doctor, do I know how to cure her?

120
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,600
Foolish thing!

121
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:32,337
Tell her I'm busy.

122
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:33,635
Understood.

123
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,900
I didn't know Your Majesty had such a penchant for bluffing.

124
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,100
She loves to whine, I don't want to deal with her right now.

125
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,400
If you don't want to see her then don't,

126
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,000
why tell me about it?

127
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,300
As if I'm to blame.

128
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,600
Of course you're to blame.

129
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,200
If you were a bit more foolish,

130
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,200
more ugly,

131
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
less gentle, understanding

132
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,180
then I might like her more.

133
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,100
Everybody says to treat new affections and old loves equally,

134
00:06:03,421 --> 00:06:05,292
Why is Your Majesty alone so partial?

135
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,800
Qi Pin can be a little difficult as times

136
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,000
but she is not one to claim illness without reason.

137
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:12,056
Why not check on her?

138
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,300
I will accompany you, <br> Think of it as a stroll.

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,900
Who says His Majesty won't come see me?

140
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,800
It's all because of you grovelling mongrels

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
trying to degrade me to suck up to Yong Shou Gong.

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Audacious!<br>Your Majesty, be careful!

143
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,500
His Majesty is here!

144
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:41,061
Greetings, Your Majesty.

145
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,300
Greetings, Your Majesty.

146
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,900
Didn't you say you were ill?

147
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:50,311
You look very well to me.

148
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,300
Thank you for your concern Your Majesty,

149
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,600
I was just disciplining the servants,

150
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,600
I really am ill.

151
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,200
Ill? Instead of resting, you're hitting your servant.

152
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,000
What wrong has she committed for you to punish her so severely?

153
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,700
She disrespected me and defied my authority,

154
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,500
I only hit her a little because she made me excessively angry.

155
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,700
You speak.

156
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:14,863
Qi Pin was hitting my maid, Pei Er.

157
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,100
Just now, she sent someone to invite Your Majesty, but the answer was no.

158
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,400
Therefore,

159
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,500
So she took her anger out on Pei Er.

160
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,000
Pei Er,

161
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,000
I am here.

162
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,500
Was it you who went to Yang Xin Dian to ask for me?

163
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,100
Your Majesty,

164
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,900
it was not me.

165
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:36,365
It was Niangniang's servant Jing Tai who went.

166
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,400
She wasn't the one who asked for me,

167
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,200
why did you take your anger out on her?

168
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,000
I was-

169
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
It's because Pei Er used to serve Xi Fei

170
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:45,969
Qi Pin has been resentful ever since

171
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,900
Xi Fei's pregnancy was announced.

172
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,500
Therefore, she would always hit me to vent her anger.

173
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:52,498
How dare you slander me!

174
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,300
You. Raise your head.

175
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,800
Hm. You really did serve Xi Fei.

176
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,400
No wonder you were cursing Yong Shou Gong earlier.

177
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,200
I would not dare!

178
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,300
Flogging a servant innocent of crime,

179
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
absolutely no compassion.

180
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,600
Your jealousy over Xi Fei's pregnancy made you disrespect your superior.

181
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,700
Moreover, the anger you vented on servants over my absence

182
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,000
is really directed at me.

183
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:20,649
Forgive me Your Majesty!

184
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,900
Your Majesty, please look.

185
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,900
Qi Pin takes every little thing out on Pei Er.

186
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,500
Look what she's done,

187
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,900
there's not one spot on Pei Er devoid of scars.

188
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,900
I am useless.

189
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,900
She always uses her higher position to rebuke me.

190
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,200
I can't even protect my own servants.

191
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,000
Pin? (Imperial Consort, 5th rank.)

192
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,400
Is this how the mistress of a palace should act?

193
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,500
Gua Er Jia (Qi Pin's family name),

194
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,400
insolent and contemptuous of authority,

195
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,800
She will be degraded to Lady.

196
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,200
Your Majesty.

197
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,178
To be moved to Jiao Hu Guan (Lagoon Palace?).

198
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
Starting today, you are grounded.

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,500
You are not to step one foot outside without my order.

200
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,900
Xin Gui Ren will take charge of Chu Xiu Gong.

201
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,300
Thank you, Your majesty.

202
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,900
Your majesty, I'm begging you!

203
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:14,541
Don't do this to me.

204
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,300
Greetings, Empress Dowager

205
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,100
Rise.

206
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,300
Thank you, Empress Dowager

207
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,400
Quickly

208
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,300
Your complexion looks better, Your Highness.

209
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,700
Everyday I have to drink so much bitter medicine,

210
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,500
so much that my face turns red.

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,500
So my complexion seems healthy even though I am not.

212
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,200
It's simply a façade.

213
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,100
Emperor,

214
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,800
Look at Xi Fei, she's too well behaved.

215
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,000
I've told her countless times

216
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,400
to dispense with palace etiquette during her pregnancy,

217
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,000
but she won't listen.

218
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,500
Xi Fei is as filial to you as I am.

219
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's inconvenient for a pregnant woman to travel, why did you come here?

220
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,500
Xi Fei's stomach looks

221
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,100
a little bigger than what one would expect for the fifth month.

222
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,400
The Imperial Doctor said

223
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,700
I have twins.

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,955
That's why it's bigger.

225
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,100
Huan Huan, truly?

226
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,600
Doctor Wen said so. I would not dare to deceive you.

227
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,900
Surely with Doctor Wen's skill a misdiagnosis is not likely.

228
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,200
Such a felicitous event,

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,800
I should proclaim it to the whole world!

230
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,100
I am already blessed with the opportunity to serve you once more.

231
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,700
I would not dare receive

232
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,400
the honour of a national proclamation, for the children in me.

233
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,400
I am not worthy of such grace.

234
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,506
Xi Fei is very sensible.

235
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,100
I have only just returned to the Palace.

236
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,900
I would not provoke any disputes if possible,

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,400
and desire only to carry my children peacefully to term.

238
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,700
I wish to be undisturbed by those who seek to congratulate me.

239
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,730
Therefore, I hope that the news about twins

240
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,800
will remain confidential

241
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:00,946
until they are born.

242
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,900
The Harem's knowledge about this matter could indeed disturb Xi Fei's pregnancy.

243
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
They will find out

244
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,100
there is no hurry.

245
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,800
Mother, I have no objections since you and Xi Fei both feel this way.

246
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,500
Only,

247
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,900
it is such a pity

248
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,100
that no one can celebrate with us over so joyous a matter.

249
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,300
Your Majesty need not feel regret. <br>If the Imperial Doctor is indeed right, celebrations are inevitable.

250
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
Xi Fei is right.

251
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,400
But being pregnant with twins

252
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,100
will only inconvenience her more to serve you.

253
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,400
There are many consorts of good character

254
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,200
among Xi Fei's friends.

255
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,100
Why not let Xi Fei have a leisurely rest,

256
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,100
and let the other consorts serve you?

257
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,000
I personally feel

258
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,900
Hui Pin to be dignified and proper. She is a good choice.

259
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,300
Yes.

260
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:58,338
I defer to your wisdom, Mother.

261
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,200
Also, the Empress may not be severely sick,

262
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,100
but the ailment refuses to leave her.

263
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,200
Why not task the Bureau of Astronomy to take a look

264
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,300
if anything is seriously wrong.

265
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,900
Then call on Baohua Temple to chant scriptures and pray for blessings.

266
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,100
Yes.

267
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
Your Majesty, the Vice Minister of the Bureau of Astronomy is here.

268
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

269
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,800
Why did you come in the Minister's stead? Where is he?

270
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,100
The Minister has fallen sick and can't attend Your Majesty.

271
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,700
Therefore, I have been sent in his stead.

272
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,600
Fine. Just as well.

273
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,900
I called you here today to inquire about

274
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
the conflict between Wei Yue Yan* and the moon.<br>(*: a constellation in Aquarius.)

275
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,100
Some months have passed, has there been any change?

276
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,800
The conflict between those two celestial bodies is from months ago.

277
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,400
Much has changed in the celestial sphere since then,

278
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,100
Wei Yue Yan* is steadily showing an auspicious purple light, a sign of great fortune.<br>(The Empress formerly used this

279
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:09,858
The conflict with the moon has passed.<br>to delay Zhen Huan's return to the Palace.)

280
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,500
If that's true,

281
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:15,946
why haven't the Empress Dowager and Empress recovered?

282
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,500
And why hasn't the Minister

283
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,400
informed me of this earlier?

284
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,900
Has Your Majesty ever heard of the saying

285
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,700
"We do as our position requires us to do,"

286
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,100
But I, your humble servant, believe

287
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,500
we do what is required to be deserving of our position.

288
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,700
Your Majesty consults the Bureau of Astronomy precisely because a conflict existed,

289
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,500
consequently the Minister gains wages and prestige.

290
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,700
If the celestial sphere is forever peaceful,

291
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,300
what use would Your Majesty have for the Bureau of Astronomy?

292
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
You seem to understand well the corruption of government officials.

293
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,600
I understand it,

294
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,700
but do not agree with its principles.

295
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,600
There is one thing...

296
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:53,028
Speak.

297
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,200
The Dowager Empress's misfortune may have lessened, but by my nightly observations

298
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,700
Well before the Suzaku Seven wood in jail

299
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,200
It is blinking with two other stars.

300
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,900
These stars indicate bad things, and will bring bad luck to other people.

301
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:08,142
The Suzaku Seven is at the south facing the southern part of the Imperial Garden.

302
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,800
May I ask if

303
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,400
any of the consorts or consorts' parents

304
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,700
have "wood" in their name?

305
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,300
The Imperial Garden has...

306
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,700
Many

307
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,500
palaces.

308
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,300
Hall of Prolonged Happiness.

309
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,100
Palace of Great Benevolence.

310
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,900
Palace of Eternal Longevity.

311
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,000
They are there.

312
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,500
It's just names with "wood".

313
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,141
Su Pei-Shung.

314
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,840
Your Majesty.

315
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,900
According to what I know,

316
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,100
only the mother of Consort An has the surname Lim.

317
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,500
Please let me investigate it.

318
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,100
Fine.

319
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,100
Just tell me what I need to do.

320
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,545
It doesn't really matter.

321
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900
It would be better

322
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,900
for the Consort to stay away from there.

323
00:14:56,418 --> 00:14:57,929
Staying away from there is enough?

324
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,400
Your Majesty,

325
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:01,549
the Empress hasn't yet recovered.

326
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:05,584
I heard that Consort An is the one who has been serving her.

327
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,800
I wonder if

328
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,900
this is the reason why

329
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,800
she can't recover from the illness.

330
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,100
Since she serves the Empress the most,

331
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,500
then

332
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,399
tell her that she is not allowed to enter the palace of the Empress.

333
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,600
Ask her to stay away from there for a few days.

334
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,800
Yes.

335
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,100
Since somebody is sick,

336
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,400
you will be

337
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:34,429
the president of Bureau of Astronomy.

338
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,100
But I still don't know your name.

339
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,042
I am Ji Wei-Sheng.

340
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,100
Greetings to you both Niangniang.

341
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,400
Su Gonggong.

342
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,300
Niangniang,

343
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,200
His Majesty will rest in Sui Yu Xuan tonight.

344
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,300
Truly?

345
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,900
Originally His Majesty intended to visit Ning Guiren,

346
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,900
but changed his mind when he was almost there.

347
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,000
His Majesty is having dinner with Hui Pin at Sui Yu Xuan right now.

348
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,700
It's rare enough for His Majesty to visit Sui Yu Xuan,

349
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,100
but even rarer that Mei Jiejie is willing to serve him.

350
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,900
The Empress Dowager summoned Hui Pin to Shou Kang Gong for a long talk

351
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
before His Majesty went to Sui Yu Xuan.

352
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,400
Survival in the Harem is impossible without His Majesty's regard,

353
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,700
perhaps the Empress Dowager's words has finally made Hui Pin realize this.

354
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,500
Your Majesty, why do you look at me so?

355
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,800
A long time has passed since I last saw you,

356
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,400
Looking at you carefully now,

357
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,800
I can't help but think something has changed since you first entered the Palace.

358
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,800
I am ageing, my looks will naturally change.

359
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,600
I used to think you were entirely generous and amiable.

360
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,000
Only the experience of these incidents

361
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,100
taught me that you are not beyond haughtiness and disdain.

362
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,800
I know,

363
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,200
you have resented me all these years.

364
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,000
I do not dare.

365
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,600
You say you do not dare.

366
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,500
Tell me frankly,

367
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,300
After Xi Fei's departure,

368
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,800
you insisted on living here.

369
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,900
Did you not do so to avoid my presence?

370
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,800
I know,

371
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,200
you have suffered through many injustices during these years

372
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:39,379
But I am the Emperor,

373
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,300
there are times when I need to sacrifice justice to preserve the overall peace.

374
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,400
Moreover, there are times when I, too, am aggrieved by injustices.

375
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:53,579
You are the Emperor, I dare not be aggrieved.

376
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,200
Your Majesty,

377
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,500
you have your difficulties too.

378
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,800
Fortunately, Huan Er is back now.

379
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,600
I...

380
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:17,794
Today I have told you my truest, innermost thoughts.

381
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,900
You have been cold to me these many years,

382
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,600
I have neglected you these many years.

383
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,600
In retrospect,

384
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,200
if not for what happened with Hua Fei all those years ago,

385
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,700
perhaps now

386
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
I would regard you

387
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:40,450
as I do Xi Fei.

388
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Dowager Empress, His Majesty is finally staying with Hui Pin tonight.

389
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,300
Hui Pin is a sensible child.

390
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:55,734
His Majesty has neglected her in the past.

391
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,100
Send them some warming* wine <br>(with aphrodisiac)

392
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,100
tell them it's from me.

393
00:20:05,112 --> 00:20:06,005
Yes.

394
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

395
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,680
Greetings, Hui Pin.

396
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,100
Sun Gugu, why have you come?

397
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,000
The Empress Dowager heard that Your Majesty is visiting Hui Pin,

398
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,800
and so sends this wine out of elation.

399
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,200
The Empress Dowager,

400
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,100
still thinks of sending wine this late at night.

401
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,200
What kind of wine is it?

402
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,600
Your Majesty and Consort Hui love each other,

403
00:20:42,813 --> 00:20:45,980
so this wine will make everything perfect.

404
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:50,439
Give her my thanks.

405
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:55,660
I will leave now.

406
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,200
We won't need this wine,

407
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,500
if we really love each other.

408
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,700
We still a long time to spend together.

409
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,200
I will come and visit you,

410
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:16,983
when you are convinced.

411
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,300
Let's go back to Hall of Mental Cultivation.

412
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,900
His Majesty is going back.

413
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,500
Your Majesty.

414
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,800
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

415
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,800
All of you leave first.

416
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,800
Young Master.

417
00:21:44,024 --> 00:21:45,877
Don't worry about me. Leave.

418
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:48,370
Yes.

419
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,800
I had given up on you.

420
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,000
Why did you have to tell me so much.

421
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,400
Your Majesty, although Consort Hua framed me,

422
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,000
you were the one who disappointed me.

423
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Look,

424
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,100
even the Empress Dowager

425
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,000
knows that we need

426
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
this wine.

427
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,900
She thinks that I

428
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,100
will definitely serve you as long as this wine is here.

429
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,100
But what about how I feel?

430
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Just who am I?

431
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,800
Does he even know about

432
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,300
my feelings?

433
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,600
He doesn't care about me.

434
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,798
Even if he knew...

435
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,600
Wen Shi-Chu.

436
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,300
Shi-Chu.

437
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,200
Young Master, did you call for me?

438
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,900
Wen Shi-Chu.

439
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,700
Young Master, you are drunk.

440
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,700
Don't drink so much.

441
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,500
What's the point of being clear all the day.

442
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,300
Can't I get drunk once?

443
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,600
Wen Shi-Chu.

444
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,200
I will call Doctor Wen here to help you.

445
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:33,501
What's the point of being clear all the day?

446
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,100
Can't I get drunk once?

447
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,600
Paracetamol.

448
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,000
Bird nest.

449
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,500
Master, it's late now, yet you pick the medicine for Consort Xi?

450
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,900
This is not for Consort Xi.

451
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,400
Consort Hui didn't have an appetite all summer.

452
00:25:09,673 --> 00:25:11,866
These medicines are to stimulate her appetite.

453
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,000
Have you memorized them?

454
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,800
Yes.

455
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,200
Wei-Len.

456
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,600
Given your skills, you can work alone.

457
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,800
I let you do these small tasks,

458
00:25:20,043 --> 00:25:23,584
because you are neat, and always assure me.

459
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,900
Doctor Wen.

460
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,900
Aunt Cai-Yue is calling you to House of Broken Jade. Consort Hui is drunk.

461
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,300
Please bring some medicine.

462
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:32,692
Yes, I will go now.

463
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,800
Are you rushing on time?

464
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,900
I will record your time to enter the palace on the board.

465
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,900
Alright, I will back within an hour.

466
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,800
Master Wen is here.

467
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,800
Miss Cai-Yue, go and boil this medicine.

468
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,700
Yes.

469
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Consort.

470
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,900
Consort.

471
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,836
Why are you so drunk?

472
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,900
You are here.

473
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,500
A person who never drinks, just drank.

474
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,600
Am I worrying you?

475
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,800
Getting drunk is painful.

476
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,400
Why do you want to hurt yourself?

477
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,600
Consort Hui.

478
00:26:27,823 --> 00:26:30,149
Don't I have a name?

479
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,000
Or to you

480
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,700
am I only a consort,

481
00:26:36,802 --> 00:26:39,932
who is no different from the women in the harem?

482
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,000
I just need to

483
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,100
do things according to His Majesty's mood.

484
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,600
Consort, I...

485
00:26:52,386 --> 00:26:53,663
please don't say that.

486
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,700
Have a seat.

487
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,900
Yes.

488
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,800
I have a bottle of wine.

489
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,800
Join me.

490
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,900
Consort, I do not dare to drink it.

491
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:13,526
Since I have given the medicine to Cai-Yue,

492
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,000
I will leave now.

493
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,300
Please understand me.

494
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:22,754
So, I can't find anyone

495
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,500
to chat with me.

496
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,700
Consort.

497
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,500
I... I will drink it.

498
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,400
Everybody says drinking wine makes you feel cheerful.

499
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,100
But after drinking it, I feel so alone.

500
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,000
Everybody in the palace

501
00:27:51,304 --> 00:27:53,928
is putting on an act.

502
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,200
Except for Zhen-Huan,

503
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,200
I am always alone.

504
00:28:01,672 --> 00:28:02,441
Consort.

505
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,700
Please don't be like this.

506
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,300
I know you are sad. I will listen.

507
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,800
This wine is good.

508
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,500
I feel warm after drinking it.

509
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:28,400
My heart is feeling the same.

510
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,900
But it will hurt you too.

511
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,100
Why do you hurt yourself for the excitement?

512
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,500
Aren't we the same type of person?

513
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,900
We hurt ourselves,

514
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,386
in order to protect our beloved.

515
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,300
Aren't we both

516
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,000
this type of person?

517
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,000
We are close friends.

518
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,100
Close friends.

519
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,800
Consort.

520
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,000
What's wrong with you?

521
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,600
Consort.

522
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:16,272
Stop.

523
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,800
Young Master, the rain is getting heavier. Let's go in and seek shelter.

524
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,700
The road is slippery. It will be bad is you fall down.

525
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,700
Alright.

526
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,600
Stop the carriage.

527
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,600
This albizia flower is pretty.

528
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,900
Now matter how pretty it is now,

529
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,300
in the end, it will fade.

530
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,100
Let's go in further.

531
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,200
It's cold here.

532
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,300
Who is she?

533
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,800
Ask her to come in.

534
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I will go take a look. Come.

535
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,300
It's Lady Ning.

536
00:31:33,305 --> 00:31:36,004
Our Consort is seeking shelter from the rain.

537
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,400
Hurry.

538
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,700
Consort. It's Lady Ning.

539
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,800
Greetings, Consort Xi.

540
00:31:45,907 --> 00:31:48,537
She is wet. Jin-Xi, give her a cloth.

541
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,400
Lady,

542
00:31:52,681 --> 00:31:54,314
don't catch a cold.

543
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,900
Do you like Albizia flowers?

544
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,700
Why don't we ask the servant to cover the flowers?

545
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,800
They can send the flowers to you when the rain stops.

546
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,300
Then you won't have to do this in the rain.

547
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:08,289
Thank you.

548
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,800
Spring is coming soon.

549
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,200
The albizia flowers are beginning to fade.

550
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,700
Among all the albizia flowers in the imperial garden, these are the prettiest.

551
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,100
That's not true.

552
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,700
The albizia flowers in House of Concentraing Glow are the best.

553
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,200
You can smell the fragrance

554
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,000
every summer.

555
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,800
I have never seen it.

556
00:32:35,127 --> 00:32:37,475
I am of low birth,

557
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
that I can't even be compared to a servant.

558
00:32:40,122 --> 00:32:42,060
But I can wander where I like.

559
00:32:43,705 --> 00:32:45,728
You shouldn't

560
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,900
look down on yourself.

561
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,700
I am the daughter of a guilty officer too.

562
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,800
The rain is subsiding.

563
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,800
When you are out,

564
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,841
do you want my servant to send you back when the rain stops?

565
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,300
No, Consort wants to go to Hall of Autumn Happiness.

566
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,500
Why would you go there?

567
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,800
Is it that you don't welcome me?

568
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,600
Greetings, Consort.

569
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,414
Greetings, Consort.

570
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,500
Have a seat.

571
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,300
Your cat is pretty.

572
00:33:49,547 --> 00:33:52,152
What's so special about it?

573
00:33:53,847 --> 00:33:54,988
Where is the cat?

574
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,900
This cat is quiet.

575
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,700
It is the most clever as well.

576
00:34:10,023 --> 00:34:11,714
Normally it doesn't meow.

577
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,800
When it meows,

578
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:15,547
the other cats come near here.

579
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,500
Are you afraid of cats?

580
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,100
No.

581
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,700
I am just curious.

582
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:24,787
How did you manage to train it?

583
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,200
I was an animal trainer, before I went to train horses.

584
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,300
It was very easy to train it.

585
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Consort, it's time to take your medicine.

586
00:34:39,061 --> 00:34:41,208
It will not taste good if it gets cold.

587
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,500
I have to go back to take my medicine.

588
00:34:45,052 --> 00:34:46,142
I was not able to stay long.

589
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,700
Since you were in the rain,

590
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:53,356
it would be good for you to have hot soup.

591
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,900
Goodbye, Consort.

592
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,800
Keep the albizia flowers.

593
00:35:11,138 --> 00:35:12,109
Yes.

594
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,100
That was bizzare.

595
00:35:15,477 --> 00:35:20,356
I was reminded of the night on Ling-Yun mountain, when I saw that huge cat.

596
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,800
It was really scary.

597
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,200
Are you okay?

598
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,000
Yes. She was just using the cat to play with us.

599
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,000
I think

600
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,700
the soy bean is delicious.

601
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,100
They make it regularly.

602
00:35:41,393 --> 00:35:43,223
I don't find anything special in it.

603
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,800
You like special things.

604
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,700
That's why you went to House of Broken Jade?

605
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,836
Are you jealous?

606
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,800
I am happy for you.

607
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,700
I was not looking for something special.

608
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,600
I hadn't been visitng Consort Hui.

609
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,800
Therefore, I felt sorry towards her.

610
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,900
Moreover, Mother always urged me

611
00:36:02,158 --> 00:36:03,890
to visit her.

612
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,200
But in the end, she still has prejudices against me,

613
00:36:08,258 --> 00:36:09,348
so I just left.

614
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,900
How could you do that?

615
00:36:12,393 --> 00:36:13,847
You have to apologize to her.

616
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,400
I had the same thought.

617
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,000
But she chased me away, saying she had a cold,

618
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,100
when I went to see her today.

619
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,800
Then,

620
00:36:23,343 --> 00:36:25,647
you should go visit Consort An.

621
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,000
I wonder why

622
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,500
I couldn't bear to leave her

623
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,187
when I went there.

624
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,200
Now I don't care about her, even when I haven't gone for a long time.

625
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,500
Consort An has her own specialties.

626
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,700
Bureau of Astronomy said that Consort An is not auspicious.

627
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,300
Although you are not afraid of it,

628
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,000
you have a shadow in your heart.

629
00:36:49,615 --> 00:36:51,364
Go and visit her after some time.

630
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,200
Oh.

631
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,700
I am here to tell you something.

632
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,800
What is it?

633
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,000
The people in the palace are malevolent.

634
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,500
I can't tolerate them.

635
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,300
Why do you say so?

636
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,900
You will be angry as well, if I tell you about it.

637
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
I have heard

638
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,200
worse things than what you have heard.

639
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,000
Since I am not angry about it, there's no need for you to be.

640
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,300
I am just afraid you might feel bad.

641
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,700
Since you know about it now,

642
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,700
I no longer feel bad about it.

643
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,300
Since you said it is intolerable to you,

644
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,700
you don't have to care about it.

645
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,100
Zhen-Huan, I only thought you were tender.

646
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,800
Now I see you are also calm and deliberate.

647
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,800
Many people

648
00:37:52,091 --> 00:37:54,551
will be involved.

649
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,400
I have a request.

650
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,800
No matter what you hear from anyone,

651
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,191
Don't be angry.

652
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,000
Don't punish them for it.

653
00:38:05,503 --> 00:38:06,391
Alright.

654
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,400
Today is the 15th of the month.

655
00:38:08,592 --> 00:38:10,591
You have to go have dinner with the Empress.

656
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,400
Go early. Don't keep her waiting.

657
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,200
These are the new dishes I ordered the kitchen to prepare.

658
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,900
Have a try.

659
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,800
Well,

660
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,700
They hold a candle to the dishes at Consort Xi's.

661
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,600
She is pregnant now.

662
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:42,643
Of course she needs to pay more attention to what she eats.

663
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,100
It is tiring for her to be pregnant.

664
00:38:45,426 --> 00:38:47,197
Therefore, she has no appetite.

665
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,000
She won't eat the food unless it looks good.

666
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,800
Everybody says the baby

667
00:38:52,962 --> 00:38:55,318
of Consort Xi is different.

668
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,502
Her stomach is bigger.

669
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,900
It is right that we be careful with the baby.

670
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:05,354
Why do you say that?

671
00:39:07,093 --> 00:39:08,947
Although I am sick,

672
00:39:08,997 --> 00:39:11,486
I hear many rumors.

673
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,700
Are you worrying about the rumors

674
00:39:13,759 --> 00:39:17,816
in the palace that never stop?

675
00:39:18,592 --> 00:39:21,893
It is useless to waste your energy

676
00:39:21,972 --> 00:39:24,238
to think about them.

677
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,900
Your body was never healthy.

678
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,600
Consort Duan and Consort Jing will host the harem for you.

679
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:35,993
Why do you care about the rumors,

680
00:39:36,158 --> 00:39:37,841
when they don't care about them?

681
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:42,718
Alright. I am full.

682
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,700
Where are you going?

683
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,000
I am going back to Hall of Mental Cultivation,

684
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,350
to mark documents.
