00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Episode 59

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,100
Why don't you come in?

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,100
though I might devour you.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,300
Your servant would not dare.

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,500
Look at you,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,100
looking as if you were my enemy.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,300
May I ask why Consort called?

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,000
I cannot fathom why.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,400
I have a question,

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,900
I hope you can answer, once you've diagnosed my condition.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,300
Yes, Consort.

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,000
Consort.

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,900
It appears my dreams were correct.

14
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,800
It couldn't be...

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,500
that night.

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,400
Don't try to tell me this is a crime.

17
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,100
This is my child.

18
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,000
I will use my life,

19
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,700
to protect it.

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,400
Shi-Chu, you must help me,

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,900
to not let this become a nightmare.

22
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,700
Is His Majesty's meeting suppose to end by now?

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,900
When I asked, it ends at this time.

24
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,700
Then let's begin to look around,

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,300
to look for my bracelet.

26
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,800
What are you searching for, this early in the morning?

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,100
Greetings, Your Majesty.

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,800
I lost my bracelet.

29
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,500
It's not a problem,

30
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,700
but it's a gift from Your Majesty,

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,900
when I first came to the palace.

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,600
- Su Pei-Seng.<br>- Yes, Your Majesty.

33
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,900
- Help her find the bracelet.<br>- Yes, Your Majesty.

34
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,900
You seldom wear such bright colors.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,500
The colors are beautiful and it suits you. You look nice.

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,600
Your Majesty, we found it.

37
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,300
There's no need to find it, should you lose it again.

38
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,000
We have thousands of them in the store.

39
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,000
I can lose the bracelet, but never the relationship.

40
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,100
I prepared tea at the House of Broken Jade.

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,100
Would Your Majesty care to try some?

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,900
Since you offered, how can I refuse?

43
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,500
You're here.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,200
Have a seat.

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,900
Cai-Yue, prepare some fruit.

46
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,300
Yes, Consort.

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,700
These clothes were made when I left.

48
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,700
I chose some nice fabrics,

49
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,500
for you to use.

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,400
You keep sending this and that.

51
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,000
This House of Broken Jade,

52
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,800
is full of your gifts since you've been back.

53
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,900
They're just things I prepared for you.

54
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,000
Consort Xi is here.

55
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,200
Greetings Consort Xi, greetings Imperial Concubine Hui.

56
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,400
Imperial Concubine Hui,

57
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,700
these are gifts from His Majesty.

58
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,000
Please accept them.

59
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,900
Cai-Yue, receive them.

60
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,700
Thank you, Eunuch, for bringing the gifts.

61
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,800
This is a present for you.

62
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,100
Thank you, thank you.

63
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,500
It's very precious.

64
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,800
Thank you, Imperial Concubine Hui.

65
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,100
His Majesty relays that those gifts

66
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,700
are for fun.

67
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,700
And asks that Imperial Concubine serve His Majesty tonight.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,700
The palanquin will be prepared for you tonight.

69
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,200
Please thank His Majesty for me.

70
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,600
Your servant will take his leave.

71
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,600
Congratulations.

72
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,000
Have you had a change in luck,

73
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,000
or in temper?

74
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,000
Nothing good or bad,

75
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,700
I just need to survive.

76
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,400
And the time will pass.

77
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,900
Su Pei-Seng.

78
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,900
Your servant is here, Your Majesty.

79
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,600
Consort Xi is pregnant. Get her some plum soup.

80
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,700
Your Majesty, your servant already asked them to prepare it.

81
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,700
Your Majesty, the plum soup looks nice.

82
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,300
May I ask for one from Consort Xi?

83
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,200
You may have wine.

84
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Su Pei-Seng, prepare a cup for Imperial Concubine Hui.

85
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

86
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,100
I am pregnant.

87
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,300
Therefore, I cannot have alcohol.

88
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,300
Since when?

89
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
A few months?

90
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:09,393
I did not feel well,

91
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,400
so I saw Imperial Doctor Wen.

92
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,700
He said I was pregnant, two months along.

93
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,700
Good.

94
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,100
It would be about two months.

95
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,400
Congratulations, Imperial Concubine Hui.

96
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,200
Since she is pregnant.

97
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,500
- Su Pei-Seng.<br>- Yes, Your Majesty.

98
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,400
Quick, change the dishes of Imperial Concubine Hui to be the same as Consort Xi.

99
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

100
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,500
The chrysanthemum in the palace

101
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,300
bloomed earlier than expected this summer.

102
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,900
I wondered if this might be a bad sign.

103
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,800
So, this news is a big surprise to me.

104
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,000
Huan-Huan and Mei-Er are pregnant.

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,500
This has never happened in the palace before.

106
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,700
Your child is arriving just in time.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,300
Empress even asked Jian-Qiu

108
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,900
to come visit everyday.

109
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,800
That worries me.

110
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,500
I know she's not sincere,

111
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,300
but still I have to serve her.

112
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,900
It tires me out.

113
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,600
True.

114
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,100
Then two powerful Consorts become pregnant at the same time.

115
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,900
She really can't relax.

116
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,800
No matter how strong she is,

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
she might not be able to handle all this.

118
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,500
Don't let it bother you too much.

119
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,000
Remember, eat mild foods and drinks,

120
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,900
drink less tea, and avoid spicy foods.

121
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,600
Never use perfume.

122
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,900
Appears you are already a mother.

123
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,800
Mumbling at me,

124
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,400
repeating things to me so many times,

125
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,800
I can memorize all you say.

126
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Thank goodness, Empress Dowager sends Wen Shi-Chu to take care of you.

127
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,000
I really don't trust anyone else.

128
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,300
Me too.

129
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,100
I don't want anyone else to care for me.

130
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,900
He's the one who took care of me all those years.

131
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,700
Your child due in eight months.

132
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
While mine just near three months old,

133
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,300
is at the most vulnerable time.

134
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,500
True.

135
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,100
I'll protect this child with everything I have.

136
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,900
You still haven't forgiven His Majesty?

137
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,500
The child is innocent.

138
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,300
There's no connection at all.

139
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,600
Should we invite Consort Jin

140
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,500
to visit Consort Duan with us?

141
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,700
Okay.

142
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,100
This servant should be punished for falling asleep while on duty.

143
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,000
Greeting to all the Consorts.

144
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,000
Is His Majesty inside?

145
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,100
Yes.

146
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,800
His Majesty is inside.

147
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,200
We shouldn't interrupt.

148
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,600
Eunuch Su.

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,700
You've served His Majesty for such a long time,

150
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,400
you should be allowed to take a rest.

151
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,400
Or else you'll be overworked.

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,200
Thank you Consorts for understanding.

153
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,200
Eunuch has dropped something.

154
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,200
Let's see.

155
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,100
This sewing skill is excellent.

156
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,100
It reminds me of...

157
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,500
Imperial Concubine who is good at knitting.

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,500
But her skill is not as good as this.

159
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,200
It looks more like yours.

160
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,700
Consort, your praise is too generous...

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,300
Take good care of it.

162
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,500
Thank you Consort.

163
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,900
Master, Master Ling-Rong is here.

164
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,000
It's late. Am I interrupting you, Sister?

165
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,000
Why, you are always welcome.

166
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
I heard that you were pregnant, so I came to congratulate you.

167
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,400
Am I being presumptuous?

168
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,800
Not at all. You came just in time.

169
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,700
I want to make a tiger hat for my child.

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,900
So he'll be warm when he's delivered.

171
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,900
But the tiger's mustache is difficult to embroider.

172
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,300
Let me try.

173
00:11:08,518 --> 00:11:09,855
Is this better?

174
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,800
With your help,

175
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,900
it really does look better.

176
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Later, place a pearl on both sides of the mustache.

177
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,700
It'll look beautiful when you wear it.

178
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,800
Good idea. Can you teach me more?

179
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,300
Master, it's time to take your medicine.

180
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,300
Too much embroidering will hurt your eyes.

181
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,200
Thank you, Master Wen.

182
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

183
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,300
Your appetite seems worse than that of Consort Xi.

184
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,100
You haven't slept well these last two days.

185
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,400
You look pale.

186
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,000
Master had a headache last night.

187
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,800
So, it was difficult for her to rest.

188
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,500
Why? What does Imperial Doctor say?

189
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,000
He said it was nothing.

190
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,900
But you don't look well.

191
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,100
Maybe it's because I spent too much energy

192
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,800
talking to Imperial Concubine An last night

193
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,400
that I couldn't sleep.

194
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,000
Imperial Concubine An?

195
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,100
Isn't she still in meditation?

196
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:12,750
It's difficult for her to come,

197
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,700
so I shouldn't turn her away,

198
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,700
as we are still sisters.

199
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,300
Master also said,

200
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,300
every time Imperial Concubine An visits,

201
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,800
she feels uncomfortable.

202
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,800
Is that true?

203
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,900
Your servant would not dare to lie.

204
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,800
I know.

205
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,900
Let Su Pei-Seng tell Imperial Concubine An

206
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,100
not to visit the House of Broken Jade,

207
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
so there will be nothing inauspicious to affect Imperial Concubine Hui.

208
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

209
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,000
Have some porridge.

210
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,100
Yes, thank you, Your Majesty.

211
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,500
Can you read this word?

212
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,900
Da (big)

213
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,800
Long-Yu is so clever.

214
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,000
Then what about this one, when we add a dash underneath?

215
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,000
Tai (over)

216
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,300
Very good, my Long-Yue.

217
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,500
Consort, Fourth Prince is here.

218
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,000
Quick, show him in.

219
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,800
Greetings, Consort Jin.

220
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,500
Brother.

221
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,000
You've come so early.

222
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,500
I wanted to greet Mother,

223
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,900
and pass by the Hall of Complete Happiness.

224
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,900
I've come to pick up Sister to go to the Hall of Long Life.

225
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,200
Fourth Prince is very polite.

226
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,700
Will you come to pick up the Princess to greet every two days?

227
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,200
You should come with me to greet Mother.

228
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,500
Fine, be sure to come back early.

229
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,700
I'll send Long-Yue back

230
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
after we have breakfast at the Palace of Eternal Longevity.

231
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,700
Okay.

232
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,300
Go with them.

233
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:44,209
Yes, Consort.

234
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,900
I'll be leaving then.

235
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,200
Ru-Yi.

236
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,500
Do you think...

237
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,900
Consort Xi taught Fourth Prince to do this?

238
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,000
She might want

239
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,100
to take Long-Yue from me.

240
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,600
Consort, don't be bothered by this.

241
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,200
Master, your servant has brought Consort Jin.

242
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,500
Show her in.

243
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,300
Yes, Empress.

244
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,300
How is the Empress doing?

245
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,100
She's been having headaches these days,

246
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,400
but is feeling better lately.

247
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,000
Once she's fully recovered,

248
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,300
I'm sure she'll be a source of many troubles for me.

249
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,100
I'm eight months pregnant,

250
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,500
but must be careful.

251
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,900
I need to make some preparations.

252
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,900
There is no need to worry.

253
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,000
I have prepared everything.

254
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,900
I'm near to giving birth.

255
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,900
But Imperial Concubine Hui hasn't yet reached three months.

256
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,800
How are you?

257
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,100
You look tired these days.

258
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,300
Nothing to worry about.

259
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,300
I and Imperial Concubine Hui,

260
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,700
have relied upon you for our lives.

261
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,300
I'm sure you're feeling tired.

262
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,700
But if you don't take care of yourself,

263
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,700
how can we be safe?

264
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,500
I thought I was just a doctor

265
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,400
that can save people.

266
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,700
But I was wrong.

267
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,100
Why are you so discouraged, and saying such things all of a sudden?

268
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,200
It's not that I feel discouraged.

269
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,700
Everyone is the same.

270
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,600
Everyone has their difficulties.

271
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,500
Just keep going.

272
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,600
But I never imagined

273
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,300
that something would happen to me too.

274
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,900
What of that?

275
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,300
As a man, you must carry your burden.

276
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,200
Don't give up no matter what you're facing.

277
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,100
Not only for your sake,

278
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,100
but for the sake of others.

279
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,400
The burden of a man.

280
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,600
Consort.

281
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,900
No, I mean Little Sister Huan.

282
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,600
If I were to make a huge mistake,

283
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,300
would you forgive me?

284
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,300
No matter what mistake you might make,

285
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,000
there will be no need to plead for my forgiveness.

286
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,300
The most important thing is to obey your heart.

287
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,300
Little Sister is right.

288
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
The thing you asked about before.

289
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,500
I'll do my best.

290
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,000
No matter how hard it is to complete it.

291
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,400
Your servant will take your leave.

292
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What is Master staring at?

293
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,900
The Imperial Household sent two boxes of oranges.

294
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,600
I just received them.

295
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,000
Jin-Xi loves oranges. Set aside two for her.

296
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,100
Where is Jin-Xi?

297
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,900
Master thinks she's not in the palace.

298
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,400
Where else would she be?

299
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,800
We need to keep something in mind.

300
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,700
Don't speak of it.

301
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,500
Empress has arrived.

302
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,400
Consort Duan has arrived.

303
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,900
Consort Jin has arrived.

304
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,300
Greetings, Empress.

305
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,700
Arise.

306
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,700
Thank you, Empress.

307
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:24,561
Consort Xi, when you're in the palace,

308
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
I shouldn't have to come here.

309
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,700
But because you're Long-Yue's mother,

310
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,500
and is now pregnant,

311
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,500
I still need to take care of you.

312
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,900
I asked Consort Jin and Consort Duan

313
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,100
to come together here with me.

314
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,900
Thank you for your kindness, Empress.

315
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,600
But I'm still unaware of what has happened.

316
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Would the Empress please tell me?

317
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,200
I haven't felt well these last few months,

318
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,500
and haven't had the energy to care for anything but my health.

319
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,100
So, I've left the cares of the palace

320
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,000
to Consort Duan and Consort Jin.

321
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,300
But Consort Duan is not in the best of health.

322
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,600
And Consort Jin is busy taking care of Long-Yue.

323
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,900
Therefore, mistakes were made.

324
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,100
Empress, please forgive us.

325
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,700
Arise.

326
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,400
Thank you, Empress.

327
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,300
Peace among the Consorts affects the government.

328
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,500
So, I must be very careful.

329
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,300
But today,

330
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,500
there is an unpardonable crime before us

331
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,200
that has come from your palace.

332
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,200
So, I am very angry.

333
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,900
Empress, please tell me.

334
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,600
During the Ming Dynasty,

335
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,100
there were cases concerning court eunuchs and maidens

336
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,200
becoming involved in relationship.

337
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,400
This problem persisted and worsened.

338
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,700
And as a result, the Ming government was tarnished.

339
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,500
Therefore, since then, the rules have been tightened.

340
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,700
And rarely have we had to deal with such a matter.

341
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,400
Today, however, we discovered that...

342
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,700
Jian Qui.

343
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Consort Xi, do you recognize this?

344
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,800
Yes, it looks familiar.

345
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,700
I think I've seen it before.

346
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,000
From the sewing skill,

347
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,600
it appears to be the work of Jin-Xi.

348
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,500
You are very observant. It indeed belongs to Jin-Xi.

349
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,500
Jin-Xi is so careless.

350
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,100
Even at her age, she is unable to take care of her belongings.

351
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,900
Thank you, Empress.

352
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,300
I'll teach her a lesson

353
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,800
once she returns.

354
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,700
It is not an offense to misplace one's belongings.

355
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,500
The essential point is

356
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:43,257
that this was in the possession of Su Pei-Seng.

357
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,900
Jin-Xi has been sent to jail.

358
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,200
So there is no need for Consort Xi to rebuke her again.

359
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,400
Consort Jin, speak.

360
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,700
Yes, Empress. What happened is...

361
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,000
a few days ago, Consort Xi, Imperial Concubine Hui and I

362
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,400
happened to meet Eunuch Su.

363
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,000
When he greeted us, the purse in question fell out of his sleeve.

364
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,100
Eunuchs are not allowed to keep such things.

365
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,000
Having possession of the purse alone does not prove anything.

366
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,900
Jin-Xi may have dropped it.

367
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,800
Su Pei-Seng might have picked it up

368
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,500
in order to return it to her.

369
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:24,671
A purse alone cannot prove anything.

370
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,200
But I'm sure Consort Xi understands

371
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,400
I can't ignore this occurrence, and just do nothing.

372
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,600
I'm here so we can avoid rumors.

373
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,100
And therefore,

374
00:21:40,362 --> 00:21:43,398
I must search Jin-Xi's room.

375
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,400
Jin-Xi is my servant.

376
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
Empress shouldn't involve herself in this matter.

377
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,700
I'll conduct the search.

378
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,300
You're pregnant and need to avoid arduous work.

379
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,300
Consort Xi is better served to avoid this matter.

380
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,100
Hui-Chun, Jian Qiu.

381
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,200
Go and search Jin-Xi's room.

382
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,500
Be thorough, and don't be careless.

383
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,100
Yes, Empress.

384
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,500
Consort Xi, you are pregnant.

385
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
Please, sit down,

386
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,500
and anticipate what they might find.

387
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,700
Search carefully. Search every corner.

388
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,300
Yes.

389
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,500
Aunt Jian Qiu.

390
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,200
Such disgrace. See for yourself.

391
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,800
Both are veterans of the palace.

392
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,400
How can they do this?

393
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,300
I must make an example of them,

394
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
so no one else will dare repeat this crime.

395
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
I beg of you, Empress.

396
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,700
Jin-Xi is my servant.

397
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,900
Allow me to administer the punishment.

398
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,500
The servant of Consort Xi also belongs to the palace.

399
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,700
As a servant of the palace,

400
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,700
I cannot let her go.

401
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,900
A servant must be polite,

402
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,100
kind, and have no personal wishes,

403
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,300
so they will be loyal in their service.

404
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,500
Otherwise, they will cause trouble.

405
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,000
Consort Xi thinks generously.

406
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,100
To the Empress Dowager and His Majesty,

407
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,300
and all others, Empress is a good queen.

408
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,100
I trust that Empress will be fair and just,

409
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,600
in order to protect the Royal Family and law of the palace.

410
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,200
Of course.

411
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,500
As head of the Consorts,

412
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,700
I must be fair, so all will remain loyal.

413
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,800
Consort Xi, be sure to take care of yourself.

414
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
Farewell, Empress.

415
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
Empress is really impatient.

416
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,100
Master, don't be afraid.

417
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,600
Afraid.

418
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,400
If I'm afraid, then after Jin-Xi

419
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,700
you'll be her next target.

420
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Then me.

421
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,100
No one can escape her.

422
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,100
Jin-Xi has been captured.

423
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,800
What happens if things worsen?

424
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,400
In that case,

425
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,400
Jin-Xi won't be only one facing trouble.

426
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,200
Even Master's reputation will be in doubt.

427
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,000
What's more important right now?

428
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,100
My reputation or Jin-Xi's life?

429
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,300
No matter what, I must protect Jin-Xi.

430
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,600
Your Majesty, Consort Xi is here.

431
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

432
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,300
Quick, quick, arise. Sit.

433
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,500
This is not the first time serving your master.

434
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,600
But when it comes to you...

435
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,200
I prefer tea to be 80% hot,

436
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,500
but this tea is too cold and therefore is less fragrant.

437
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,900
It's your servant's fault, your servant's fault.

438
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,600
Your Majesty, Xiao Sha-Zi is still young.

439
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,200
Don't be angry with him.

440
00:25:43,478 --> 00:25:44,808
What he needs is more practice.

441
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,000
Xiao Sha-Zi, bring some hot water.

442
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
Yes, Consort.

443
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,800
Su Pei-Seng is not here.

444
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,000
They could not control themselves.

445
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,400
They haven't done anything good.

446
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,100
A team of good horses need a leader,

447
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,800
so they can travel well together.

448
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,500
They are team of people

449
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,500
who follow orders.

450
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,900
With Su Pei-Seng being imprisoned,

451
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,600
it's like they've lost their direction.

452
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,500
Empress has already informed me

453
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,900
about the case concerning Su Pei-Seng and Cui Jin-Xi.

454
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,700
Actually, I was planning to visit you

455
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,900
after reading these proposals.

456
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,300
But you came to see me first.

457
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,400
It's my fault

458
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,300
that I didn't teach my servant properly.

459
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,100
As you have said,

460
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm worse than you.

461
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,500
Su Pei-Seng has served me since my youth.

462
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,400
They made a mistake.

463
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,600
There's nothing we can do.

464
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,300
Since this occurrence,

465
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,200
I've never felt such emptiness.

466
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,200
Even though Jin-Xi made this mistake,

467
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,800
she has served me for so many years.

468
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,800
I feel both sad and angry.

469
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,600
You're being pregnant now,

470
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,100
it's of utmost importance that you to take care of your health.

471
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Empress' health is improving.

472
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,000
Let her take care of the matters of the palace.

473
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
If you're that sad about Jin-Xi,

474
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,600
I will ask Imperial Household to find a better maid for you.

475
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,200
Why didn't Master ask for His Majesty's help?

476
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,800
His Majesty is the only one who can influence the Empress.

477
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,000
The Empress was prepared.

478
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,600
She already has evidence.

479
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
She's using the rules

480
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,400
His Majesty is powerless to do anything.

481
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,200
If ask him for help,

482
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,000
I'd be falling into her trap.

483
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
She would punish me under the rules of being unfair.

484
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,900
What can we do?

485
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,500
If Master is affected,

486
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,500
no one can save Jin-Xi.

487
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,200
Let's go to the Ministry of Justice.

488
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,200
That place is very hot.

489
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,100
Being pregnant, Consort shouldn't go there.

490
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,700
Surely, you're aware of this.

491
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I've endured cold in the palace many times.

492
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,800
It's nothing to be scared of.

493
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,400
The pregnancy has already been difficult.

494
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
If not yourself, think of the Prince.

495
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,000
Please avoid the negative effects of the Imperial Criminal Division.

496
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,000
If he can't endure such a small matter,

497
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,100
he's not my child.

498
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,100
Let's go.

499
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
(Work harder, don't be lazy.)

500
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,100
It's warm in here.

501
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,300
Why are the blankets so thick?

502
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,400
They use thick blankets and dry grass

503
00:28:28,611 --> 00:28:30,323
for punishment here.

504
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,500
They make it hot

505
00:28:31,732 --> 00:28:33,327
to bring about malaria.

506
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,100
But when the coldest day of winter comes,

507
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,400
they are given only a light blanket.

508
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,000
Prisoners are known then to freeze to death.

509
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,400
Aunt must be undergoing the punishment of rice beating.

510
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,600
The prisoners only get

511
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,400
two hours of sleep everyday.

512
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,700
And they receive rice beating when they're awake.

513
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,800
(Work harder, don't be lazy.)

514
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,400
(What are you doing? Work faster.)

515
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,600
(Keep working, lazy bitch.)

516
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,600
Why are you slowing down? Work faster.

517
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,700
Do you want to live?

518
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,400
Work harder.

519
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,000
(Bitch, work harder.)

520
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,200
(What are you looking at? Where are you looking?)

521
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,800
Work faster, bitch.

522
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,700
(Still don't want to work? Do you want to die?)

523
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,800
(I'm talking to you.)

524
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,800
Servant didn't know Consort Xi was here.

525
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,400
Greetings, Consort Xi.

526
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,200
Is there a person named Cui Jin-Xi here?

527
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,400
Yes, she just arrived.

528
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,900
She's beating rice over there.

529
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,800
Can Aunt help me out?

530
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,400
Let me have a few words with her.

531
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,500
Sure, sure.

532
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,200
Please wait. I'll call her over.

533
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,700
Cui Jin-Xi, come!

534
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,200
Consort, take your time.

535
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,300
I'll be going.

536
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,900
Thank you.

537
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,500
Why is Consort here?<br>(Too slow, work faster.)

538
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,500
Consort is pregnant. Why would you come to such a place?

539
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,900
(I'll beat you to death. Do it right.)

540
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,900
It's my fault that

541
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,600
Consort would have to come to such a place.

542
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,300
There must be a lot of rumors, ridiculing Consort.

543
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,800
Servant feels so guilty to face Consort.

544
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,700
If you caused me trouble,

545
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,100
how could I come visit you?

546
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,200
You have been loyal to me from the beginning.

547
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,500
But to see you like this,

548
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,300
I feel so sorry.

549
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,100
No need to rush.

550
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
I will find a way to save you.

551
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,500
Better not to. Master is pregnant now.

552
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,400
Please don't bother.

553
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,600
What if something happens to the baby?

554
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,100
Actually, servant knew,

555
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,700
once all this started,

556
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,900
I would have to face a bad ending.

557
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,400
The worst is that

558
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,200
the Empress has evidence.

559
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
Add to that,

560
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,500
even if Master saves me

561
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,300
your servant

562
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,900
wouldn't know how to face the rumors in the palace.

563
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,900
It's better just to leave me here.

564
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,900
Jin-Xi.

565
00:31:10,255 --> 00:31:11,257
Master.

566
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,800
It'll be hard for us to go back.

567
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,200
Master must think ahead.

568
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,000
i won't be disappointed if Master leaves me.

569
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,700
You must take care of yourself.

570
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,500
And give birth to your baby.

571
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,400
I'd really be glad with that.

572
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:31,428
It's easy to die.

573
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
Hang yourself and end it all?

574
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,700
But what those around you? Would they be happy and glad?

575
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,700
It's a loss.

576
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,000
Trust me in this relationship.

577
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,500
I'm going to save you.

578
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,800
This place...

579
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,200
Master, please don't come to this place again.

580
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,300
Servant will take care of herself.

581
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,500
Do you know where Su Pei-Seng is?

582
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,200
Must be something similar,

583
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,300
being punished somewhere.

584
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
He's facing all this because of me.

585
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,200
If not for me,

586
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,100
he'd be enjoying his life as Head Eunuch.

587
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,700
Actually, I've never really thought of others...

588
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,000
About Su Pei-Seng...

589
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,100
Both of us,

590
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,700
just used each other, and relied on each other,

591
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,800
to gain a better life.

592
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,500
But that day at the Ministry of Justice,

593
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,500
even as they beat him, he never mentioned my name.

594
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,300
I was really touched by his actions.

595
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,200
A true relationship is built in difficulty,

596
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,200
It is very precious.

597
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,100
When I saw Master and him.

598
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,600
The two of you

599
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,500
looked like perfect match.

600
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,100
Now that I've experienced it,

601
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,400
I understand its meaning.

602
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,600
Don't worry.

603
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,000
I'll take care of Su Pei-Seng.

604
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,300
So, you take care of yourself.

605
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,100
Don't worry about me.

606
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
Consort Xi is here.

607
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Sister.

608
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,500
Little Sister.

609
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,400
Sister is reading poetry?

610
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,600
I'm afraid I'm interrupting you.

611
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,600
There's a big problem at your palace.

612
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,400
I rushed over to see you.

613
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,700
Never thought you wouldn't listen.

614
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,100
Tell me everything. Have a seat.

615
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
I...

616
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,400
I really want to save Jin-Xi and Su Pei-Seng.

617
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,400
It's to help His Majesty as well.

618
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,700
Su Pei-Seng served His Majesty for so long.

619
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,400
He understands His Majesty very well.

620
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,000
His sudden capture,

621
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,700
has affected His Majesty's reputation.

622
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,200
In addition to that, no one serves His Majesty

623
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,400
as well as he does.

624
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,300
Little Sister is right.

625
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,500
Honored Lady Qi, please stop there.

626
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,600
Empress has arrived.

627
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,900
Greetings, Empress.

628
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,300
Arise.

629
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,900
Thank you, Empress.

630
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,100
Empress, finally you've come.

631
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,000
This place truly is worse than the Palace of Gathered Elegance.

632
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,200
I don't know when I'll be able to leave.

633
00:34:58,455 --> 00:35:00,280
Has His Majesty forgotten all about me?

634
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,300
Do you really want to get out of here?

635
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Empress, please save me.

636
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,900
It's almost Mid-Autumn Festival.

637
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,900
I'll advise His Majesty to allow you to leave this place then.

638
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,200
You should know what to do to thank me.

639
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,100
I will do my best.

640
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,100
His Majesty has arrived.

641
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,000
His Majesty has come.

642
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

643
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,600
Arise, arise.

644
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,600
You look well today.

645
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

646
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,800
You have a weak disposition. Be sure to take care of yourself.

647
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,500
Mencius' teaching is deep and meaningful.

648
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,700
I like it very much.

649
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,900
Indeed, you seem to like it very much.

650
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,000
What do you gain from it?

651
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,100
Reading Mencius,

652
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,200
you realize the limited thinking of Zhu-Xi.

653
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,000
Zhu-Xi called himself a teacher,

654
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,700
and the people call his philosophy an authority.

655
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,700
but in actuality, he misunderstood Kong-Zi and Mencius' teaching.

656
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,700
Why do you say that?

657
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,600
Mencius said, a man and woman living together is a normal way of life.

658
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,500
But Zhu Xi said, we must kill personal desires to maintain justice.

659
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,800
That's not really realistic.

660
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,800
Zhu Xi made a mistake.

661
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,600
But it happens in the palace.

662
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,500
If we follow Zhu Xi's teaching,

663
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,800
how can the consorts

664
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,600
serve Your Majesty and bear children?

665
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,800
So, I think the person who says such things

666
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,100
must be a cold-blooded person.

667
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,300
Contrary?

668
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,000
Did you meet with anyone recently?

669
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,100
Or hear any rumors?

670
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,000
Your Majesty, my weak disposition prevents me from going out a lot.

671
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,900
And even when I do,

672
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:10,668
I'm sure Your Majesty already knows,

673
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,000
I do not like to involve myself in other people's concerns,

674
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,000
or repeat rumors that I hear.

675
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,400
Yes, that's right.

676
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,100
I think that's your strong point.

677
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,700
That's why I want to ask for your opinion.

678
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

679
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,800
Nowadays, everybody in the palace

680
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,200
is talking about Cui Jin-Xi and Su Pei-Seng.

681
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,400
Empress calls for punishment.

682
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,800
Consort Jin remains silent.

683
00:37:38,998 --> 00:37:41,177
Consort Xi is not

684
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,700
What do you think?

685
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,400
There are many beauties in the palace.

686
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,500
But no one can decide who is the most beautiful.

687
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,700
Take a blossom, for example.

688
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,100
Its admirers will say it is suitable anywhere.

689
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
while others will just let it fly away.

690
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,700
Everybody is different.

691
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,700
It all depends on the heart.

692
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,800
What happened today,

693
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,300
Empress believes it's about to the rules and discipline of the palace.

694
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,200
But I do not agree.

695
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,600
They did not bring any harm to the palace.

696
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,700
It's just about a maiden and an eunuch

697
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,600
wishing to connect with each other.

698
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,500
Servants come to the palace and work here until they die.

699
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,800
It's sad.

700
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,500
They just wanted to find someone to be with.

701
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,700
I feel heavyhearted thinking about this.

702
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,300
Then what do you think?

703
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,000
Your Majesty, have you ever heard the phrase?

704
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,000
If you don't pretend to be silly or deaf, you won't have a daughter-in-law.

705
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,600
Even in the case of a relationship

706
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,200
If Your Majesty doesn't trust me,

707
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,000
you can check for yourself.

708
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,500
It probably happens in the palace all the time.

709
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,400
Do you really want to kill all of them?

710
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,100
Your Majesty is the Emperor of a kingdom -- the king.

711
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,100
Your burden is heavier than others.

712
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,300
You should show your generosity

713
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:03,559
to lessen the impact of this case.

714
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:12,100
Consider Consort Xi and Imperial Concubine Hui.

715
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,700
They shouldn't be exposed to such severe cases.

716
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,200
Right.

717
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,300
The Consorts are pregnant.

718
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,700
I should

719
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,000
All right. You should get some rest now.

720
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:33,728
I'm going to return to the Hall of Mental Cultivation.

721
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,700
Farewell, Your Majesty.

722
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,600
By the way, Your Majesty.

723
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,100
It's windy lately. Ask the servant

724
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,400
to put chrysanthemum in your tea.

725
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,500
Your lips are chapped.

726
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,500
Okay.
