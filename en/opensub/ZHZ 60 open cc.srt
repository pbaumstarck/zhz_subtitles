1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Episode 60

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,800
Mistress, can we trust Consort Duan?

3
00:00:09,247 --> 00:00:11,800
If we use her, I trust her. If I didn't, I wouldn't use her

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,582
The Emperor is here!

5
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:19,758
Greetings Emperor

6
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:20,657
Hurry, rise

7
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:21,453
Thank you Emperor

8
00:00:24,784 --> 00:00:26,523
Why are you here at this time?

9
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,158
You surprised me

10
00:00:32,088 --> 00:00:33,866
You're just getting ready

11
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:37,303
Such a peaceful sight

12
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:39,654
Why are you doing your hair now?

13
00:00:40,547 --> 00:00:43,134
When you first came in, you looked very happy

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,308
Share it with me

15
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:48,227
So I might share your happiness

16
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,840
Huan Huan is truly meticulous

17
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:55,378
The officials gave reports at court this morning

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,370
That this autumn is very prosperous

19
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:00,822
The people are also happy and healthy

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,406
When I heard it, I was happy

21
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:04,840
Last night I went to see Consort Duan

22
00:01:05,217 --> 00:01:07,205
She's usually very quiet

23
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:10,903
But when she does speak, she speaks sense

24
00:01:13,276 --> 00:01:16,011
Consort Duan has been in the palace for a long time

25
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,572
Emperor, you've always been very good to everyone

26
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,889
Treating everyone with mercy

27
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:23,025
That's why the people are happy and healthy

28
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:24,620
And the people are at peace

29
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:27,736
I can see, everything is stable at court

30
00:01:29,112 --> 00:01:31,024
When Empress Chun Yuan was the First Wife

31
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,609
The way she ruled the manor

32
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:35,372
If she was here today

33
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:37,005
The harem

34
00:01:37,574 --> 00:01:38,978
Would be even more stable

35
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:41,061
You've heard of Empress Chun Yuan?

36
00:01:42,673 --> 00:01:43,584
Jin Xi has been in the palace for a long time

37
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:45,688
When she's serving me

38
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:49,414
She would mention the good Empress Chun Yuan did

39
00:01:50,316 --> 00:01:51,778
If I may say

40
00:01:52,324 --> 00:01:54,244
If Empress Chun Yuan was still here

41
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:57,001
Then Jin Xi and Su Pei Sheng's situation

42
00:01:57,296 --> 00:01:58,858
How would it be dealt with?

43
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,840
If Chun Yuan was still here

44
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:03,516
I think

45
00:02:04,112 --> 00:02:06,540
The current Empress is Chun Yuan's biological sister

46
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,083
Their attitudes must be similar

47
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:11,742
The Empress said

48
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:15,055
She wants to make them an example

49
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,859
She musn't really

50
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,915
Want their lives, right?

51
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:22,176
Besides, the Emperor treats everyone so well

52
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:23,762
I'm sure the Empress

53
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:26,213
Wouldn't go against the Emperor

54
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:28,203
Wouldn't go against Empress Chun Yuan

55
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,132
How can Yi Xiu be compared to Chun Yuan?

56
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:36,118
You must be tired being pregnant with twins

57
00:02:36,844 --> 00:02:38,042
Yet there's rumours in the palace

58
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:40,994
That they are not my kids

59
00:02:41,588 --> 00:02:42,856
Other people aside

60
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:46,169
Even the Empress wants me to be wary

61
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:49,736
The Empress

62
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,206
Is just ruling the harem

63
00:02:52,703 --> 00:02:54,627
Consort Duan said something correct

64
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:57,881
There's 2 Consorts pregnant in the palace

65
00:02:58,697 --> 00:03:01,301
Who can't handle seeing heavy punishments

66
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:02,933
Even if they were to be punished

67
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,320
It should be later

68
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:06,246
The Emperor was asking

69
00:03:06,246 --> 00:03:07,792
Why the Misstress was only doing her hair now

70
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:09,085
There's a reason

71
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:10,387
With Jin Xi gone

72
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:12,086
Mistress was so angry and upset

73
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,961
She hasn't slept well in 2 days

74
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,169
Dr Wen's idea is good though

75
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:18,606
Brushing hair can help relax

76
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:19,618
And can sleep better

77
00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:20,153
Stop talking

78
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:22,779
Who asked you to speak in front of the Emperor

79
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,215
Emperor

80
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,855
Don't listen to Huan Bi

81
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,179
I'm fine, I sleep well

82
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:31,094
You still want to hide it?

83
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,332
I can see the dark circles under your eyes

84
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:35,039
You mustn't be sleeping well

85
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:36,741
Huan Huan

86
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:39,872
You wish everything would be well

87
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,903
And prevent Huan Bi from telling the truth

88
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,376
That I can serve again at the Emperor's side

89
00:03:46,537 --> 00:03:47,652
Is my fortune

90
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:49,332
It doesn't matter if I'm upset

91
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:51,821
But Jin Xi

92
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,200
She's been beside me for many years

93
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:55,859
In my heart

94
00:03:56,332 --> 00:03:57,845
I'm always going to find it hard

95
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:01,560
But it is Jin Xi's fault

96
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:04,257
The Empress is the master of the harem

97
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,960
If she really wants to play by the rules

98
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:08,858
There's nothing I can do

99
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:10,636
I can only obey

100
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,538
Even though the Empress is in charge

101
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:16,925
Doesn't mean I can't have a say

102
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,537
The Emperor shouldn't quarrel with the Empress over this

103
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:22,859
You should blame me

104
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:24,567
I didn't teach my servant well

105
00:04:25,158 --> 00:04:27,671
This kind of matter has been happening for dynasties

106
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:31,415
It's not the first case

107
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,281
After all they are lonely servants

108
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:39,579
Even though eunuchs aren't considered men

109
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:42,094
They still have human emotions

110
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,846
Why should I suppress what is human?

111
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:49,009
Actually this problem

112
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:51,550
Is contained within the palace walls

113
00:04:52,686 --> 00:04:54,247
If we just cover it up, it'll be fine

114
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:57,201
If it was made into a big deal, and the citizens heard it

115
00:04:57,249 --> 00:04:58,518
It'll become a laughingstock

116
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,628
Su Pei Sheng has served the Emperor since young

117
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:04,177
Surely he's spent much more time

118
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,519
With the emperor, even more than me

119
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,743
He's done a good job

120
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:10,800
What spend more time?

121
00:05:11,505 --> 00:05:14,183
It sounds like you're jealous of him

122
00:05:14,658 --> 00:05:18,403
I really can't do anything with you women and small people

123
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,465
Huan Huan is a woman

124
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,520
In my tummy are small people

125
00:05:23,058 --> 00:05:24,449
If Emperor thinks it's too difficult

126
00:05:24,653 --> 00:05:26,098
Then you don't have to support us

127
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:28,290
How could I bare that?

128
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:38,263
Jin Xi

129
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,044
Niang Niang

130
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:43,695
As long as you're back

131
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:44,341
- Is Niang Niang alright? <br> - As long as you're back

132
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:46,375
As long as you're back

133
00:05:46,456 --> 00:05:47,617
Please forgive me

134
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:48,819
Get up, get up

135
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:51,138
The Emperor said

136
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:53,028
Will only fine you a year's salary

137
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,415
As long as you're ok

138
00:05:56,892 --> 00:05:59,331
Thank you Niang Niang. Thank the Emperor for his grace

139
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:03,851
Take Jin Xi into her rooms to rest

140
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,484
You don't need to come serve me these couple of days

141
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,219
I'm fine

142
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:11,708
What about Su Pei Sheng?

143
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:14,538
Everything's fine, he's back at Yang Xin Hall

144
00:06:16,662 --> 00:06:17,627
Go and rest

145
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:18,316
Thank you Niang Niang

146
00:06:18,332 --> 00:06:20,409
Huan BI, help Jin Xi go rest

147
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:22,012
Let's go

148
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:48,892
Your servant, Su Pei Sheng

149
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:50,539
Greet the Emperor

150
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,248
Greetings Emperor

151
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:55,901
You're back

152
00:06:56,688 --> 00:06:58,100
Thank you Emperor

153
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,616
I can never repay such kindness

154
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,245
As long as you're back. Make ink

155
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:04,578
Yes

156
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,975
Emperor, have this white fungus soup

157
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:12,123
I'll help you make ink

158
00:07:28,678 --> 00:07:30,726
I know what you want to ask

159
00:07:31,236 --> 00:07:34,436
Yong Shou Hall is fine, Cui Jin Xi is fine

160
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:39,622
I fined you a year's salary. Quite a small punishment

161
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:41,734
This kind of embarrassing situation

162
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:44,836
I can't just ignore the Empress's reasoning

163
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,738
I had to set an example

164
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,532
I understand

165
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,180
Why didn't you tell me earlier

166
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,769
I was afraid if I mentioned it

167
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,736
It'll dirty your ears

168
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:05,498
Forget it

169
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:07,498
Don't see her in the future

170
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:09,220
So that others don't gossip

171
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:13,391
Emperor

172
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,904
I've known Jin Xi for a long time

173
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:19,490
And we're from the same town

174
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,514
I'm old

175
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:24,992
Being castrated, I have no sons or daughters

176
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,167
I don't have anyone to bury me

177
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,126
I only want to be companions with Jin Xi

178
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:33,978
Emperor

179
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:37,046
I mean it

180
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:41,926
Alright

181
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:45,279
We'll forget I said that

182
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:47,069
And I didn't hear what you said

183
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:49,046
You deal with it yourself

184
00:08:49,682 --> 00:08:51,534
Thank you for your grace

185
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:53,321
Thank you Emperor

186
00:08:57,906 --> 00:08:59,556
Greetings to all mistresses

187
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:03,339
The Empress just woke up, please wait here

188
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,599
Niang Niang's chrysanthemums are beautiful

189
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,590
We'll just admire them here

190
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:09,891
There's no hurry

191
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:11,520
Please feel free

192
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,017
Jie Jie was saying

193
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,342
The servant is a reflection of the master

194
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,373
This situation caused a big ruckus

195
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:25,345
I want to see how Consort Xi gains back her "face"

196
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:28,746
How will she gain back her "face"

197
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:30,747
She's embarrassed the whole palace

198
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:33,793
If I were her, I'd hide away with the servant

199
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:36,002
I'll never leave Yong Shou Palace

200
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:42,351
Cui Jin Xi is her confidante

201
00:09:42,787 --> 00:09:46,448
She might have planned this whole thing to seduce the Emperor

202
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:49,738
She's just hidden it well

203
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:07,296
Greetings Consort Xi

204
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,489
I haven't congratulated Precious Qi on your release

205
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,856
Precious Qi must've been so bored during your grounding

206
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,881
Jump right back into the pit once you're out

207
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:30,023
Who's right and wrong, Niang Niang must know

208
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:33,120
Why would you blur what's black and white?

209
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,650
The Empress was merciful

210
00:10:42,072 --> 00:10:43,914
So that mid-autumn we may be whole

211
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:47,070
She begged the Emperor to let Precious Qi out

212
00:10:48,002 --> 00:10:49,784
Thinking she's learnt her lesson

213
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:52,132
Yet you're still so impudent

214
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:54,533
The effort's wasted on you

215
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:57,755
What I did wrong was only about me

216
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:01,923
Not like Niang Niang's companions, did something so embarrassing

217
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:07,058
Or is it the servant following the ways of the master?

218
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:18,402
I was sick the last two days

219
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:20,201
I'm better now

220
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:22,184
So I can come and serve Niang Niang

221
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:25,900
Let me

222
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:31,397
Huan Bi, it's cold early in the morning

223
00:11:31,673 --> 00:11:33,770
You should've brought a cloak for Niang Niang

224
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:37,518
What if she caught a cold? The Emperor would be sad

225
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:43,704
Precious Qi as a concubine

226
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:48,053
What you just said, was it really appropriate?

227
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:50,823
"The servant following the ways of the master"

228
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:53,860
Then, Niang Niang is a Consort

229
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:55,888
You are just a Precious

230
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:59,225
You must know the difference in status

231
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:00,848
Besides

232
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,678
When Young Miss was cruel to the servants

233
00:12:04,345 --> 00:12:07,979
Was it also "the servant, following the master"

234
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:10,840
Young Miss is being a little ridiculous

235
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:14,433
You Cui Jin Xi are the ridiculous one. You're the one who broke the rules

236
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:17,884
Su Pei Sheng and I are good friends

237
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:19,423
But so what?

238
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:21,921
Young Miss doens't like

239
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:25,049
That the Emperor let me go

240
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:28,414
So "breaking the rules"

241
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,549
Is certainly not something I can admit to

242
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:33,550
If Young Miss really wants to say I broke the rules

243
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:36,717
Then are you saying the Emperor covered for me?

244
00:12:36,938 --> 00:12:38,406
Approving of mess within the palace?

245
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:42,325
And what do you guys think?

246
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:44,570
The same as Precious Qi

247
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,397
I dare not

248
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,650
The Empress is up, please come in

249
00:12:59,357 --> 00:13:01,795
Jin Xi came today too

250
00:13:01,974 --> 00:13:03,645
Yes, Empress

251
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,391
Serving Consort Xi is my duty

252
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:09,637
Jin Xi, you're an old hand in the palace

253
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:13,285
In the future, be careful when serving Consort Xi

254
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:17,030
Don't cause any trouble for her

255
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,620
Yes, thank you for the reminder

256
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:23,027
Mid-autumn is almost here

257
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,079
I heard Guo Jun Wang should be returning soon

258
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,690
Plus Consort Xi's due date is coming up

259
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:34,379
Imperial Concubine Hui is also pregnant <br> The Emperor wants this to be a grand event

260
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:40,059
The Empress should decide, we will be happy with everything

261
00:13:46,252 --> 00:13:49,267
Su Pei Sheng greets Niang Niang

262
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:50,423
You're here

263
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:55,303
Emperor wanted me to bring this date soup for Niang Niang

264
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,005
Thank the Emperor for this thought

265
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,556
It's been hard on you

266
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,060
Huan Bi, bring a seat

267
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:07,005
Thank you Niang Niang

268
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:18,490
You've lost weight in the days I haven't seen you

269
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,276
I had thought that I was quite healthy

270
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:27,444
Didn't think that doing a few day's labour

271
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:29,924
Would ruin my body like this

272
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:32,496
I'm getting old and useless

273
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,054
At least now I returned to the Emperor's side

274
00:14:37,054 --> 00:14:39,826
Other people won't dare to gossip

275
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:43,579
But... Jin Xi

276
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:46,140
You must know

277
00:14:46,182 --> 00:14:50,763
Jin Xi would be gossiped about because she's with me

278
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:57,816
Even though this was caused by your accidentally dropping the purse

279
00:14:58,476 --> 00:15:02,135
I wanted to protect the two of you yet I couldn't do much

280
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:04,845
At least the Emperor thought of the old times

281
00:15:04,845 --> 00:15:06,705
Yes

282
00:15:07,103 --> 00:15:12,743
I didn't realise my momentary mistake would even disrupt the Empress

283
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:15,949
I've learnt my lesson

284
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,630
This lesson isn't just learnt by you

285
00:15:18,948 --> 00:15:21,394
But I'll remember too

286
00:15:21,394 --> 00:15:22,966
Yes

287
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:24,995
Then Jin Xi

288
00:15:24,995 --> 00:15:26,656
Don't worry

289
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:30,041
As you've said that, I have nothing to worry about

290
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,095
I'll leave first <br> Alright

291
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:45,236
Let me Let me

292
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,804
Just sit

293
00:15:48,965 --> 00:15:50,927
You haven't even realised there's a hole in your shirt

294
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:53,821
Aren't you afraid the Emperor would say something?

295
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:01,137
I know you can do it, but you're so busy

296
00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:05,038
Are you ok?

297
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:08,101
Me? I'm great

298
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:13,068
The more people say about me, the better I will live

299
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:15,328
We live life for ourselves

300
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:18,933
If I go hang myself, it'd only give them pleasure

301
00:16:19,972 --> 00:16:22,160
That's right

302
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:28,283
But I also know, you first approached me

303
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:30,763
Because of Consort Xi

304
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,186
If you don't really want to be with me

305
00:16:34,186 --> 00:16:39,070
And seeing as the rumours are going wild, why don't we stop meeting?

306
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:44,231
What are you saying? We're together to keep each other company

307
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:53,370
Aside from Consort Xi, you're the only one who's close to me

308
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:58,501
When I thought a lot during my exile

309
00:16:58,501 --> 00:17:02,439
Why should I hurt someone who really cares for me

310
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:05,405
Because of other people's rumours

311
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,643
It's your auspicious day Miss, why don't you wear something red?

312
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:31,291
I'd look like a country bumpkin all rouged up

313
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:33,430
Go get me a green outfit

314
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,818
Miss, you only wear green or aqua

315
00:17:37,074 --> 00:17:38,920
Why don't you change the colour today?

316
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,992
I said I want the green one

317
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:45,053
If you want it more cheerful, get the one with the silktree flower embroidery

318
00:17:45,053 --> 00:17:46,544
Ok

319
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:55,682
Miss

320
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:06,462
Very pretty, come with me to the Chun Hua Palace Autumn's festival tonight

321
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:12,259
I only wanted to not be ugly, not to compete with you Miss

322
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:16,264
You should dress pretty while you're young

323
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:20,088
I'm not dressing pretty for Wang Ye

324
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:23,931
If you dress up, you'd be even prettier

325
00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:29,072
I am ashamed in front of him

326
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:33,078
Anything I have to show off can only be for the Emperor

327
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:45,642
The Emperor has arrived

328
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:52,121
Greetings Emperor

329
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:54,024
Sit

330
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,050
Have a seat

331
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:04,338
Your hands are so cold, are you ill?

332
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:07,609
It's been a bit cold at night lately

333
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,854
Where's 17th brother?

334
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:19,288
I'm late

335
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:23,252
Please forgive me

336
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:27,299
I'm used to you being late and leaving early at parties

337
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,301
Back then you stubbornly wanted to go to Shen Jin

338
00:19:31,382 --> 00:19:33,913
Nowadays you seem tired

339
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:38,974
I became ill when I arrived in Shen Jin

340
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:42,674
Why didn't anyone tell you? What are your servants doing?

341
00:19:42,674 --> 00:19:48,298
I told them not to say anything. It wasn't anything major. I'm better now

342
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,901
You need someone to take care of you

343
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:54,230
Do you have anyone in mind?

344
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,755
If I favoured anyone, I would tell you

345
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:03,568
Perhaps all I wish for is a dream

346
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:10,243
Actually Yun Xi has also grown up

347
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:13,009
Should also find a wife and settle down

348
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:16,755
Sister in law is making fun of me. I think the same as 17th Brother

349
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:20,241
I must find someone who I love

350
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,663
Look, the older one making the younger one dream too

351
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:26,116
Yun Xi's afraid of getting a wife

352
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:30,140
Our Great Qing only need descendants from the Emperor's family

353
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,255
We can be lazy

354
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:45,599
Congratulations Imperial Concubine Hui

355
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:47,916
Thank you Wang Ye

356
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:56,454
Consort Xi is well too?

357
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,076
May Wang Ye also be well

358
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:07,172
Niang Niang is almost due, is your health alright?

359
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:10,372
Thank you Wang Ye, everything is fine

360
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:20,535
Emperor, Miss needs to take her medication

361
00:21:20,535 --> 00:21:22,448
You should go

362
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,024
I'll be back soon

363
00:21:36,312 --> 00:21:42,374
Hopefully everyone lives long, including those living far away.

364
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:50,151
Mistress, are you well?

365
00:21:50,151 --> 00:21:52,254
I thought I could hold it in.

366
00:21:52,254 --> 00:21:56,409
I thought I could forget him.<br>I almost forgot myself.

367
00:21:56,756 --> 00:22:00,122
I understand the heartbreak that Wang Ye and Mistress are going through.

368
00:22:00,122 --> 00:22:03,014
-But...<br>-He must live well.

369
00:22:06,296 --> 00:22:12,539
Mistress is in a bad mood.

370
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,912
Are you well?

371
00:22:31,912 --> 00:22:36,737
I just said in the room,

372
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:41,010
Just now was just now. <br>Now is now.

373
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:48,227
Now that I've returned, I just want to know that you are doing well.

374
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:52,639
That way I don't have to worry.

375
00:22:55,535 --> 00:22:58,831
If you care too much for me

376
00:22:58,831 --> 00:23:01,398
then you won't feel well.

377
00:23:01,802 --> 00:23:06,158
Please don't have too much concern. Huan Bing let's return.

378
00:23:06,158 --> 00:23:07,757
Don't leave.

379
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:11,217
Let go. Let go.

380
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:14,374
Let go.

381
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,549
I get the feeling that you aren't living well these days.

382
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:38,720
Regardless of whether it's a golden house or a hut, <br>it's my willing choice.

383
00:23:39,229 --> 00:23:43,460
Whether or not I can be comfortable depends on myself. It has nothing to do with anyone else.

384
00:23:43,978 --> 00:23:46,061
It's like Precious Ning.

385
00:23:47,297 --> 00:23:51,547
Although her position was low, she had more freedom.

386
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:53,215
And it's you we are talking about.

387
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,708
You're not her.

388
00:23:57,337 --> 00:24:00,078
Whether or not you are happy you may not know yourself.

389
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,221
The moon has its cycles and people go through many changes.

390
00:24:06,976 --> 00:24:12,012
Don't feel sad for people who aren't worth feeling sad for.

391
00:24:15,398 --> 00:24:20,735
If a person can't live following their own heart

392
00:24:21,258 --> 00:24:27,813
it's worse than the moon. At least on the 15th of every (lunar) month the moon will be round.

393
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:31,500
So I won't choose to be that persistent.

394
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:40,376
If I continue to talk to you I'm worried that the Emperor will notice.

395
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:53,938
Take care of yourself.

396
00:24:59,138 --> 00:25:01,791
To avoid bad luck I will return first.

397
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,481
You can go in after I've gone in for a while.

398
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:17,066
Who?

399
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:19,153
Huan Bi, what happened?

400
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:21,940
I just saw someone's shadow pass by.

401
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,144
Let's hurry back.

402
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,659
During the day time the garden looks nice.

403
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:45,480
But at night it seems full of negative energy.

404
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,280
We go this way everyday.

405
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,113
What is there to be afraid of.

406
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,889
Where did so many cats come from? Hurry and protect Niangniang.

407
00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:02,794
There's cats. Hurry let's go!

408
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,800
Mistress, how are you?

409
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,700
Niangniang!

410
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:15,825
Niangniang!

411
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,000
It hurts!

412
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,400
What to do?

413
00:26:19,506 --> 00:26:22,541
Use more strength Niangniang

414
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:26,260
Use your strength.

415
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,500
Come on!

416
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,498
Use your strength!

417
00:26:30,544 --> 00:26:32,177
How is it? Did she give birth?

418
00:26:33,097 --> 00:26:34,578
What to do?

419
00:26:34,621 --> 00:26:37,717
Niangniang, use your strength

420
00:26:39,596 --> 00:26:44,124
Go check the medicine used to speed up the labor. It has to be very dense before Niangniang can drink it.

421
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,255
Okay okay.

422
00:26:50,135 --> 00:26:53,132
Niangniang, the Emperor just received the news and will be here shortly.

423
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:56,654
There is a question that I must ask Niangniang.

424
00:26:56,683 --> 00:27:00,434
If anything goes wrong, do I save you

425
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,828
or the child?

426
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:06,267
Wen Shizhu, with the many years of our friendship

427
00:27:06,286 --> 00:27:09,336
I want you to promise me

428
00:27:09,386 --> 00:27:12,369
no matter what happens

429
00:27:12,414 --> 00:27:15,426
you cannot harm my child.

430
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:17,210
Do you hear me?

431
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:22,065
I already knew that would be your answer. But I had to ask.

432
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:28,300
Remember, protecting the three of us is the best thing.

433
00:27:29,537 --> 00:27:35,028
If you can't, then you have to protect the child first.

434
00:27:35,056 --> 00:27:36,818
Can you remember this?

435
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:40,364
Or else even if you save me

436
00:27:41,346 --> 00:27:45,183
I will definitely commit suicide.

437
00:27:45,653 --> 00:27:48,185
Or other terrible things.

438
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:52,068
I mean what I say.

439
00:27:52,068 --> 00:27:53,876
Did you hear me?

440
00:27:53,936 --> 00:27:56,893
What kind of situation are you in to say those ill words?

441
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:05,311
The Emperor has arrived.

442
00:28:06,736 --> 00:28:11,577
Go, tell the Emperor

443
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:15,747
that if something happens

444
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:19,383
don't have the Emperor dwell on our many years of love.

445
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:22,636
Don't hesitate

446
00:28:22,636 --> 00:28:25,560
to protect the child.

447
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,067
Niangniang <br> Mistress,

448
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:30,799
how can you say such unlucky things when you are in this situation?

449
00:28:30,885 --> 00:28:32,561
Niangniang, use your strength.

450
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:35,202
Niangniang

451
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:37,971
Protect the child over the mother?

452
00:28:38,058 --> 00:28:42,297
I have said that Consort Xi and the child must both be saved.

453
00:28:42,352 --> 00:28:44,905
or else every imperial physician will be buried with her.

454
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:02,121
The heaven have already punished me enough. My child cannot have an accident.

455
00:29:26,316 --> 00:29:28,737
Mistress woke up.

456
00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:33,334
Child. Where is the child?

457
00:29:33,886 --> 00:29:37,799
Niangniang, the wet nurse has the child and will be here soon.

458
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:43,815
It's a twin girl and boy. You have given me a phoenix and dragon.

459
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:52,173
Has Mei jiejie visited? And what about doctor Wen? Why isn't he here anymore?

460
00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:56,241
Imperial Concubine Hui is pregnant so I told her to get some rest.

461
00:29:56,598 --> 00:30:00,179
Doctor Wen didn't leave, he is in the back personally watching the medicine.

462
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:13,876
Niangniang, I heard that you twin phoenix and dragon bring good luck

463
00:30:13,876 --> 00:30:19,341
to the kingdom. Congratulations Niangniang, Congratulations Emperor!

464
00:30:19,341 --> 00:30:24,240
Well said! Yongshou Palace will receive half a year's wages

465
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,435
as a reward for serving your mistress so well.

466
00:30:27,435 --> 00:30:29,795
Thank you your Majesty.

467
00:30:34,647 --> 00:30:37,725
I came to congratulate the Emperor and Niangniang.

468
00:30:37,725 --> 00:30:39,558
Auntie came.

469
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:43,923
The Empress Dowager heard that the birth was successful and all three are healthy, and is very elated.

470
00:30:43,923 --> 00:30:46,679
She asked me to see you.

471
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:51,095
I ask auntie to give Empress Dowager my thanks.

472
00:30:51,095 --> 00:30:56,033
I don't know if I can have the honor

473
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:59,308
of first seeing the little prince and princess

474
00:30:59,308 --> 00:31:02,058
so I can give a good report back to Empress Dowager.

475
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,403
-Bring the babies here <br> When the Empress Dowager finds out

476
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,420
She will definitely be very happy

477
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,065
and her health will take a turn for the better.

478
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:12,266
I haven't even seen them yet.

479
00:31:17,663 --> 00:31:25,363
Little princess and little prince give their greetings to your Majesty.

480
00:31:28,915 --> 00:31:32,106
The prince's forehead and chin looks like Huanhuan's.

481
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:42,526
The princess's eyebrows look like Huanhuan's.

482
00:31:43,156 --> 00:31:46,787
The children are still young, how can you tell that they look like me?

483
00:31:46,787 --> 00:31:48,955
You just know how to cheer me up.

484
00:31:48,955 --> 00:31:51,898
When the father sees the children more he loves them more.

485
00:31:52,355 --> 00:31:55,198
Huanhuan, I thank you.

486
00:31:55,198 --> 00:31:59,526
Emperor, the children are still young. The nurses should take them.

487
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:01,632
Yes, hurry hurry.

488
00:32:01,632 --> 00:32:05,080
I have seen them and now I can report back to Empress Dowager.

489
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,296
Okay

490
00:32:06,296 --> 00:32:08,942
I will take my leave.

491
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:16,513
Huanhuan, do you know how happy I am?

492
00:32:16,513 --> 00:32:19,986
You gave birth to two children for me.

493
00:32:19,986 --> 00:32:24,276
You have made such an accomplishment that I will name you as Noble Consort.

494
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:28,335
I want you to be my beloved Noble Consort.

495
00:32:28,335 --> 00:32:30,818
If you want to give me the title of Noble Consort

496
00:32:30,818 --> 00:32:33,009
I honestly can't take it.

497
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:38,222
Besides you, no one else in my heart can have the title of Noble Consort.

498
00:32:39,477 --> 00:32:42,819
You were well just a while ago how can you start coughing?

499
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:47,033
Feiwen! Niangniang just gave birth how can you open the windows?

500
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:48,946
Hurry and close it.

501
00:32:48,946 --> 00:32:51,541
Your majesty, just now the midwife said

502
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:53,977
that the palace smelled strongly of blood so to open the windows.

503
00:32:53,977 --> 00:32:55,557
So I didn't close it.

504
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,791
You caused Niangniang to catch cold air and you talk back? Take her out for 20 slaps.

505
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,174
Yes.

506
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:02,649
Su Bisheng?

507
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:09,337
Tell the palaces that Yongshou Palace's Consort Xi is now Noble Consort Xi.

508
00:33:09,337 --> 00:33:13,228
When the children are a month old we shall make it official.

509
00:33:13,228 --> 00:33:17,974
After Consort Xi recovers she will have some power over the harem.

510
00:33:17,974 --> 00:33:19,815
Yes your Majesty.

511
00:33:21,485 --> 00:33:23,915
Huanhuan, do you like it?

512
00:33:23,915 --> 00:33:27,804
It is your gift, of course I cherish it.

513
00:33:28,327 --> 00:33:30,155
The Emperor is inside listening.

514
00:33:30,155 --> 00:33:32,502
You slap yourself. Mine are too hard.

515
00:33:32,502 --> 00:33:36,039
Gongong, this really doesn't have to do with me.

516
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:39,434
I am just listening to orders.

517
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,874
The Emperor loves Niangniang and is taking some anger out on you.

518
00:33:41,874 --> 00:33:43,442
Don't take it to heart.

519
00:33:43,442 --> 00:33:47,210
The Emperor loves Niangniang so he takes his anger on us servants?

520
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:51,532
Watch what you say. If the Emperor hears you it won't just be slapping yourself.

521
00:33:59,107 --> 00:34:02,484
Niangniang, I boldly as you for a reward.

522
00:34:02,484 --> 00:34:06,234
Anything that you reward me with

523
00:34:06,234 --> 00:34:09,187
I will gratefully accept and receive some good luck

524
00:34:09,788 --> 00:34:12,083
If I want to reward you it will be a big one.

525
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,694
It takes the Emperor to be here to ask me?

526
00:34:17,528 --> 00:34:21,002
Before, you two suffered a lot.

527
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:24,422
Today since Noble Consort has asked

528
00:34:24,422 --> 00:34:28,233
I will officially give Jingxi to you to be your wife.

529
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,607
You must treat her well.

530
00:34:30,627 --> 00:34:31,952
Okay.

531
00:34:32,002 --> 00:34:33,261
Thank you your Majesty!

532
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:34,931
With the Emperor and Niangniang's love

533
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:38,373
I will definitely, definitely treat Jingxi well.

534
00:34:40,456 --> 00:34:42,663
Go ask them for wine to drink.

535
00:34:42,674 --> 00:34:44,214
Niangniang!

536
00:34:48,764 --> 00:34:53,521
You rest well, I will come see you at night.

537
00:34:54,152 --> 00:34:56,847
I wish you a safe return.

538
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:08,221
Seeing his Majesty off.

539
00:35:17,794 --> 00:35:19,948
Just now Consort Jing came to see you.

540
00:35:19,948 --> 00:35:22,131
Do you want to see her?

541
00:35:22,448 --> 00:35:27,028
I'm tired now. Go tell her that I'm thankful.

542
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,546
When I feel better I will personally go see her.

543
00:35:34,915 --> 00:35:37,519
Go tell her my words.

544
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,398
Right now I won't see anyone who comes.

545
00:35:40,398 --> 00:35:43,183
Yes.

546
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:49,901
A small princess and a small prince. Both are adorable.

547
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:53,442
Empress Dowager is so happy that she look enough at them.

548
00:35:53,783 --> 00:35:57,874
With such a happy occasion even if looking at them caused me to go blind I would be happy.

549
00:35:57,874 --> 00:36:02,306
Bring them further away so they don't get my sick air.

550
00:36:02,306 --> 00:36:07,245
Consort Xi's children are premature so you must care for them very carefully.

551
00:36:07,277 --> 00:36:09,246
No accidents can occur.

552
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:10,383
Yes.

553
00:36:10,383 --> 00:36:12,771
Did you think of the names?

554
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:15,268
Sixth prince will be Hong Yan.

555
00:36:15,268 --> 00:36:18,894
Let me look at sixth prince.

556
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,603
Such a good child.

557
00:36:25,614 --> 00:36:27,652
White and chubby,

558
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,113
not like the the Emperor who was very dark.

559
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:35,748
Consort Xi has fair skin so of course her children will be lighter skinned.

560
00:36:35,748 --> 00:36:40,862
I haven't decided on the Princess's name. I'll have Consort Xi think of a name.

561
00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:45,782
That works well. You name the prince and she names the princess.

562
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:50,883
When Imperial Concubine Hui gives birth I will name the child.

563
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:03,743
Since the children have been born I can clear my name.

564
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:08,148
I will not tolerate and wild rumors about you.

565
00:37:12,387 --> 00:37:14,727
Being able to bring up the children is Heaven's gift.

566
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:16,617
I don't have anything to be upset about.

567
00:37:16,617 --> 00:37:21,269
You speak carefully. Yet others suspected your pregnancy.

568
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:30,833
No matter how big the harem is it's between women.

569
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:35,543
Empress will take care of this, so you don't need to get involved.

570
00:37:35,543 --> 00:37:38,221
That way you won't get a reputation for being biased towards me.

571
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:42,243
I just want them to know that I dote on you the most.

572
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:45,867
That way they won't bully you.

573
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:49,969
The Empress used to be able hold up the title of being virtuous.

574
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:57,182
But now she's changed. Maybe it has to do with her age.

575
00:38:13,088 --> 00:38:15,796
Empress has arrived.

576
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:27,070
Greetings, your Majesty.

577
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,483
Sit.

578
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:32,534
I don't have my manners, forgive me.

579
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:38,353
You can just lie down. You have accomplished a lot.

580
00:38:38,353 --> 00:38:41,208
Thank you for you care.

581
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:45,702
After Consort Xi gave birth to these babies

582
00:38:45,862 --> 00:38:48,248
I don't have anything to give them.

583
00:38:48,248 --> 00:38:53,147
But before, a sister gave me some valuable Suet jade.

584
00:38:53,147 --> 00:38:58,903
I asked the workers to work through the night to create jade pieces for the two children.

585
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,243
It can keep them safe.

586
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:05,467
Her things are of high quality.

587
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:09,092
You can give it to the children. It must have been difficult to part with it.

588
00:39:09,496 --> 00:39:12,788
Jiejie left me with many items.

589
00:39:12,788 --> 00:39:15,302
I don't usually take it out

590
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:17,803
as it represents our good relationship.

591
00:39:19,411 --> 00:39:21,824
Naturally.

592
00:39:22,548 --> 00:39:26,715
It's been a while since I've visited you.

593
00:39:28,062 --> 00:39:34,812
I am aging and becoming ugly. I can't compare to the youth of my sisters.

594
00:39:34,812 --> 00:39:41,650
If you have time then visit the young sisters more. Don't coop yourself up and look at reports and see your officials.

595
00:39:44,992 --> 00:39:50,493
Today I came after I sorted through half of jiejie's items, the rest is still there.

596
00:39:50,493 --> 00:39:54,761
As it's still early I will take my leave first.

597
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:56,428
Mmm, go then.

598
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:11,200
