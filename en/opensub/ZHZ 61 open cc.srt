00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Episode 61

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,600
Greetings to Empress

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,100
What happened to your face?

4
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:22,501
I did something wrong

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,600
Fei Wen, stop watering the flowers. Go get this month's money.

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,500
Yes

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,400
Fei Wen

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,500
- Where are you going? - Jian Qiu

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,500
Huan Bi asked me to get money from Imperial Household

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,100
Is that so? I'm going too. Let's go together.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,100
The Board of Rites gave our princess three titles. Which do you like?

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The Board of Rites naturally chooses the best words. It's all the same.

13
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,000
Our princess has a mild temper. In contrast, Hongyan is mischievous.

14
00:01:17,422 --> 00:01:20,666
But I think Hongyan's pleasant and cheerful temper is good.

15
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:26,185
Hongshi always lacks vigor and is afraid of seeing me.

16
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,000
Emperor wants to be a strict father, so you can't blame your son being afraid of seeing you

17
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,800
I promise you, I will be a benevolent father in front of them.

18
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,700
You should also think of a good name for our baby princess.

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,500
Although two lovers are separated

20
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:47,114
Their hearts beat as one

21
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:51,550
Shall we call her Lingxi?

22
00:01:51,587 --> 00:01:56,454
Lingxi? Lingxi

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
You and I have chemistry for the past ten years

24
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:03,046
Our baby shall be titled Princess Lingxi

25
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,000
Your Majesty. Your Lady Highness.

26
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,882
It's time to feed Prince and Princess

27
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:10,323
The wet nurses have to bring them out

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,200
Ok

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,500
Yes

30
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,700
Huanbi has followed you for many years

31
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:24,074
She seems to look more and more like you

32
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:27,002
You've said that before

33
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,400
You said that her eyes look like mine

34
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,700
Her good looks are incomparable to you in the past

35
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,100
Even though her eyes are like yours

36
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,500
Nevertheless, she's just a servant. Now that she has grown older,

37
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,600
her character has become similar to yours.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,800
What has happened to you today?

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,500
Singing praises of my servant. Aren't you afraid it might cause a rumour?

40
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,200
You're already a mother. Yet you've become petty?

41
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,100
If she wasn't your private servant, I might not even have sung her praises

42
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,000
It's just that Huanbi reminded me of Longyue

43
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,300
She has grown and becoming more and more like you

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,400
When she's much older, I'll let her come back

45
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,300
So that you and her can be reunited

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,700
Longyue, do you like this little rabbit?

47
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:31,139
Mother, I want a little tiger

48
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,500
It's too difficult to cut a little tiger. I don't know how

49
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:39,022
Mother knows. Mother knows everything.

50
00:03:40,232 --> 00:03:45,341
Ok, for my Longyue, I'll learn to do everything. I'll try it now.

51
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,900
Greetings to Niangniang

52
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,300
Rise

53
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,800
Thank you Niang niang

54
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,300
Gui Fei Niang Niang said she hasn't been free the past few days. Since the weather is fine today,

55
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,400
she wishes to invite you over.

56
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,000
- Ok, you may leave first. I'll go over soon. - Yes

57
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,500
Niang Niang, do we need to bring Princess Longyue?

58
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,154
Longyue, wait here for me. I'll be back soon.

59
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,300
- Coax Longyue to nap. I'll be back soon. - Yes

60
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,900
Jing Fei has arrived

61
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,718
Gui Fei Niang Niang

62
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,287
Have a seat

63
00:05:16,376 --> 00:05:18,536
It's a rare chance to be free today

64
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,500
We should have a nice chat

65
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,700
Gui Fei Niang Niang is busy taking care of your twins

66
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,800
and taking charge of the trivialities in the Imperial Harem. Don't you wish you had more time?

67
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:31,592
How would I dare to come and disturb?

68
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,600
Jiejie has now come to call me Niang Niang. Have we become estranged?

69
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:41,084
Even though Meimei doesn't mind, we should still follow the rules of hierarchy.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,200
Taking over of Hua Gui Fei's position as Xi Gui Fei

71
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,900
You truly deserve the honour

72
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,700
If we talk about etiquette and experience,

73
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,000
don't you think you can become Gui Fei too?

74
00:05:57,713 --> 00:06:01,269
Aren't they all the same?

75
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:05,519
I still remember when you left the palace, Emperor once mentioned you

76
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,600
He sang praises of when he first met you

77
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:13,998
He said your smile was breathtakingly beautiful

78
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,600
He hasn't forgotten you all these years

79
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:24,618
Who isn't beautiful when they're young?

80
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,100
But time catches up with us too fast

81
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,500
It's only a matter of time when he is sick of our aged looks

82
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:40,126
Whether or not women in the Imperial Harem live a good life

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,100
is of unimportance

84
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:47,695
Fortunately, Emperor has you in his heart

85
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:50,941
Jiejie has always been intelligent

86
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,400
and sees all matters clearly

87
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:56,449
Since you know Emperor treats me very well,

88
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,958
then why do you want to challenge and oppose me?

89
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,700
You know it already

90
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,200
You must have told Empress about the relationship between Jinxi and Su Peisheng

91
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:13,982
They're both discreet

92
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:17,994
The only loophole is that jade piece

93
00:07:18,353 --> 00:07:20,561
It has been once spotted by Jiejie as Jinxi's handicraft

94
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,592
Other than I, it's only you and Meizhuang who were present that day

95
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:31,071
And during those days, you have made frequent trips to Jingren Palace

96
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:36,086
Gui Fei Niang Niang is very smart

97
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,100
Since you have already known, then why ask?

98
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,000
It's good that you already know

99
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,115
Saves me the trouble of worrying

100
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,000
I've done you harm this time. It's my fault.

101
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:56,968
Jiejie doesn't fight for Emperor's favour, and doesn't do evil

102
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,990
In the past, even under Hua Fei's power, you could give in in order to survive

103
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,700
Whatever you've done now

104
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,878
is just to keep Longyue at your side

105
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:17,512
If not for Longyue, I'm afraid my life would be meaningless

106
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:23,156
Meimei, since your entrance, Emperor has always favoured you

107
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:26,834
How would you understand my loneliness?

108
00:08:27,826 --> 00:08:29,593
Do you know?

109
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,636
My palace has a total of 326 bricks

110
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,503
But I've touched them all umpteenth times

111
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,500
Lines have started to form in 31 of them

112
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:48,875
If not, how could I have survived through these lonely nights?

113
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:53,629
Actually, I knew it all along

114
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,400
that I'm just a pawn of Emperor to divide Hua Fei's power

115
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,100
You've never mentioned this to me

116
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:06,745
When you asked me to look after Longyue,

117
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:10,005
I not only have someone to rely on,

118
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:13,760
but also have someone to spend my time with

119
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,200
Throughout these years

120
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,759
I have always treated Longyue as my own

121
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:23,667
I've never imagined that you will return

122
00:09:23,843 --> 00:09:25,348
And you still returned?!

123
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:30,054
Did you know

124
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,696
I didn't investigate your deed at Jingren Palace

125
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,300
It's Empress who leaked the news on purpose

126
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,700
If she really treated you well, she wouldn't have let anyone know what you've said to her

127
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:44,492
But the news spread to my ears

128
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:46,577
Think carefully

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,800
Empress wants to let you know on purpose. She wants the two of us to be in dispute.

130
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,700
Meimei, please believe me

131
00:09:59,385 --> 00:10:01,973
I didn't harm you on purpose

132
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:04,961
I only wanted Longyue to be with me for a few more years

133
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:06,941
Just a few more years

134
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,500
I've promised Empress

135
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:12,187
I'm only doing harm this once. Just this time.

136
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,270
But then

137
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,300
I still fell into her trap

138
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,400
Whether it's using me against you, or you against me

139
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:28,769
it all benefits Empress

140
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:31,507
It's not that you haven't thought carefully

141
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:36,471
You risked just for Longyue

142
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:43,500
A loving mother willingly does anything for her child

143
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,559
It's either you or Empress

144
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,800
I've no other choices

145
00:10:58,387 --> 00:11:02,350
I have nothing to say anymore

146
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,979
I will accept any punishment that Xi Fei Niang Niang gives

147
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,700
In that case, please help me take care of Longyue

148
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,300
until she marries

149
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,400
But- but she's your flesh and blood. How would you bear to?

150
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:22,561
My time is all used to take care of Hongyan and Lingxi

151
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:25,690
Longyue treats you as her real mother

152
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:30,599
If I were to force her to be with me, then I would have killed our mother-daughter relationship

153
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:39,331
With your words, I will love and care for Longyue with all my heart

154
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:46,603
Jiejie loves Longyue with all your heart

155
00:11:46,684 --> 00:11:49,812
Even as a biological mother, I don't think I can do better

156
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,500
Your help in taking care of Longyue

157
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,501
means that I am able to save all my three children

158
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,700
Thank you

159
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,200
On the Royal Decrees of His majesty

160
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:29,308
Xi Fei Niuhulu being virtuous and modest

161
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:35,390
Under the edict of Empress Dowager, promoted as Xi Gui Fei

162
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,757
Gratitude for His Majesty's benevolent grace

163
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:49,655
Thank you, Emperor

164
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,000
Emperor arrives!

165
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,600
- Greetings to Your Majesty - Rise - Thank you

166
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:07,320
What has brought Emperor here?

167
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,400
I can't wait to see you. I'd rather accompany you than wait at Jingren Palace.

168
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,400
Today is an important day, the more we should watch our manners. Emperor please leave first, I will follow suit

169
00:13:18,826 --> 00:13:21,992
Must you be so strict on rules all the time?

170
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,400
I dare not break the rules in the past, the more I should follow the rules now

171
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:29,997
You said this when we first met too

172
00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:32,673
You still remember

173
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:40,999
I'll never forget

174
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:49,200
Xi Gui Fei Niuhulu blessed by the heaven to serve within the palace

175
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,600
May you be well-behaved, live in harmony within the harem, serve the Emperor well and continue the family line

176
00:13:56,075 --> 00:13:59,665
Grateful for Your Majesty's advice

177
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:21,665
Xi Gui Fei is smart and thoughtful

178
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:26,100
Since Empress hasn't been feeling well

179
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,488
You should retire

180
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:32,600
I have decided to let Xi Gui Fei deal with matters of the Six Palaces

181
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:37,054
She shall take charge of all trivalities. What do you think?

182
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:41,471
That's great. However, although my health is poor,

183
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:44,393
she still has to take care of her children

184
00:14:44,393 --> 00:14:47,799
and Longyue has to return to Yongshou Palace soon

185
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:52,912
I'm afraid she doesn't have the time

186
00:14:53,202 --> 00:14:55,594
She and I have decided

187
00:14:55,732 --> 00:15:00,067
to let Jing Fei raise Longyue

188
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,089
There's no need to move

189
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:08,383
And the wet nurses will take care of Hongyan and Lingxi to take the load off Xi Gui Fei

190
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,803
So I've worried too much

191
00:15:11,803 --> 00:15:16,210
But she's new in taking charge of the Six Palaces

192
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,889
though there aren't much to deal with, they aren't small matters

193
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,063
I'm afraid she may be stressed

194
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:28,810
What Empress said is right. I'm still young and inexperienced

195
00:15:29,538 --> 00:15:34,461
Duan Fei entered the earliest, while Jing Fei has some experience

196
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:38,969
I'm keen to learn from them

197
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:43,159
That's good

198
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:47,371
Does Empress have anything else to add?

199
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:51,815
Xi Gui Fei, in future you are the head of all concubines

200
00:15:51,815 --> 00:15:56,928
Not only do you have to manage the harem well, you also have to serve the Emperor well

201
00:15:56,928 --> 00:16:00,258
and bear more imperial heirs

202
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:04,908
I will not let you down

203
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,890
You've kneeled too long. Hurry rise

204
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,907
Thank you

205
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,239
Make good use of your gold pendant

206
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:24,761
It's not just a piece of stone anymore

207
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:32,020
I've to change. Shall Emperor and Xi Gui Fei leave for

208
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,349
Chong Hua Palace to receive congratulatory note first

209
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,214
A husband's passion is like hot liquer, a wife's wish is like soft silk

210
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,000
Hot liquer may cool, but silk is everlasting

211
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:53,932
May Emperor's love for Xi Gui Fei be everlasting like silk

212
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:57,351
Emperor, please drink up

213
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:00,029
Sure

214
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:13,260
Congratulations Xi Gui Fei

215
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:16,176
Congratulations Xi Gui Fei

216
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,000
Everyone take your seat

217
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,160
I'll go to your palace tonight

218
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:35,039
It's Hongyan and Lingxi's full month celebration today. I'm afraid Longyue may be jealous

219
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,840
Why don't Emperor go to Jing Fei's palace instead?

220
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,162
Longyue will be elated

221
00:17:41,162 --> 00:17:42,715
Ok then

222
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,800
I must treat Longyue fair too

223
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,227
The water Lady is using is made of the best rose petals

224
00:18:03,227 --> 00:18:05,672
Your hands will become soft and silky after using

225
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:11,229
- Where's Hongyan and Lingxi? -They are being nursed right now

226
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:16,717
Lady, there are too many gifts to handle

227
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,151
You've good taste. Just choose those you like

228
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:27,322
Duke Kangjin has given a bamboo fan made of illuminated raw silk of a fawn

229
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:30,904
What's special is that its handle is as cold as jade

230
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,900
Also, Pei Guo Gong Fu has sent a pair of ivory chopsticks

231
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,041
Though silver chopsticks can also detect poison, they aren't as rare as this

232
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,635
The most evil are those who use poison. They're hard to prevent.

233
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:49,160
I appreciate his sincerity

234
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:53,316
Is his surname Meng?

235
00:18:53,364 --> 00:18:54,889
Yes

236
00:18:55,812 --> 00:19:00,616
His daughter Meng Jingxian was the one betrothed to 17th Prince

237
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:03,094
I wonder if she's married now

238
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,275
She hasn't. She only has heart for 17th Prince

239
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:09,091
She has become an old maid

240
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:12,910
Does she think that she will be able to marry 17th Prince if she waits?

241
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:15,994
There are so many girls who admire 17th Price

242
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:19,583
I'm afraid he doesn't even know how she looks like

243
00:19:19,768 --> 00:19:21,974
Why are you so agitated

244
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:23,951
and mean?

245
00:19:24,537 --> 00:19:26,372
I just can't stand her

246
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:29,197
As if she isn't afraid others don't know she's waiting for 17th Prince

247
00:19:29,197 --> 00:19:31,261
An embarrassment to him

248
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:35,162
These gifts are all the same

249
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:38,351
Keep the common ones to reward others in future

250
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:42,103
Others are not worthy of a mention, but look at this red coral bracelet given by 17th Prince

251
00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:45,016
It's exquisite

252
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:53,645
Though this beautiful coral is in my hands

253
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:56,192
I can never own it as someday it will go to a better person

254
00:20:00,316 --> 00:20:01,474
Lady

255
00:20:01,474 --> 00:20:04,413
Since Emperor is staying at Jing Fei's Palace tonight

256
00:20:05,012 --> 00:20:08,282
and Mei Jiejie isn't feeling well, let's go visit her

257
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,816
Greetings to Xi Gui Fei

258
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:22,275
Stop

259
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:30,556
Greetings to Ning Guiren

260
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,736
What pleasant mood. Are you out for a stroll?

261
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:37,662
Just walking around

262
00:20:37,662 --> 00:20:39,991
I'll hug my cat to sleep when I'm back later

263
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:42,703
Your cat is adorable

264
00:20:42,703 --> 00:20:44,853
Has it grown?

265
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:48,975
If you're interested, please come to my palace to take a look

266
00:20:49,703 --> 00:20:51,552
Can Niang Niang give me the honour?

267
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:55,459
Yet, Niang Niang is followed by many servants

268
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:59,720
I'm afraid my cat will be frightened

269
00:21:00,014 --> 00:21:04,225
Niang Niang should know that it's the cat's purr that's interesting

270
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:11,323
It's a beautiful night. It would be a pity if I decline your invitation

271
00:21:11,842 --> 00:21:14,151
Huanbi, come

272
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:20,748
What a rare invitation

273
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:24,480
I shall go then

274
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:27,115
All of you stay here

275
00:21:35,615 --> 00:21:37,218
What do you want?

276
00:21:37,218 --> 00:21:39,258
Be careful of this dagger

277
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:42,753
I've once been injured by a leopard

278
00:21:43,694 --> 00:21:46,132
I sneaked into its nest

279
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:47,931
and cut its throat

280
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,343
If Huanbi screams

281
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:52,974
then this dagger

282
00:21:52,974 --> 00:21:55,831
will make a slit through Xi Gui Fei's throat

283
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:58,562
Don't frighten Huanbi

284
00:21:59,293 --> 00:22:00,972
You've lured me here

285
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:03,349
yet allowed Huanbi to follow

286
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,951
I bet you've a foolproof plan

287
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,042
Niang Niang is wise

288
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:13,952
Even if I accidentally killed you and your servant

289
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,472
It's Jiaolu Palace nearby

290
00:22:16,472 --> 00:22:19,642
I can make Qi Guiren the scapegoat

291
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:24,599
Since she already wishes to kill you

292
00:22:25,014 --> 00:22:27,986
I can make her wish come true

293
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:32,370
Aren't you and I enemies since a long time ago?

294
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:37,671
If not why would you let your cat lead so many other cats

295
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:40,490
to come get me and my children's lives?

296
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,390
Since you've guessed it correct

297
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,470
then why keep your cool for so long?

298
00:22:47,027 --> 00:22:49,989
I don't want to make things difficult for you

299
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,257
You're Emperor's favourite consort

300
00:22:53,815 --> 00:22:56,517
I don't worth your killing because of 17th Prince

301
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:59,549
because of 17th Prince

302
00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:02,864
You knew

303
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:07,152
You love pink siris flowers more than your life

304
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,920
and someone also told me

305
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:12,777
there was once when your life was imperil

306
00:23:13,052 --> 00:23:15,188
it's he who summoned an imperial physician to save you

307
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,910
But if he knew he saved an evil girl

308
00:23:20,251 --> 00:23:22,827
he would be disappointed

309
00:23:23,253 --> 00:23:26,112
He saved you once! But you're evil

310
00:23:26,112 --> 00:23:28,591
You don't deserve admiring 17th Prince

311
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:32,934
You aren't this agitated when I said I was about to kill your Lady

312
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:35,342
What happened to you when we mentioned 17th Prince?

313
00:23:35,342 --> 00:23:36,848
You

314
00:23:37,271 --> 00:23:38,771
Demon

315
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:40,848
Yes I'm a demon

316
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:43,757
That makes Xi Gui Fei the head of all demons

317
00:23:44,387 --> 00:23:47,824
Since you've had an affair at Ganlu Temple, why sought the love of Emperor again

318
00:23:47,824 --> 00:23:49,833
and returned to his side?

319
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:56,010
Is fortune more important than the love of 17th Prince?

320
00:23:56,461 --> 00:23:58,082
Ever since I met him,

321
00:23:58,082 --> 00:24:01,565
I knew he is the most chivalrous man on earth

322
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,558
I've never seen him in such pain and misery

323
00:24:06,498 --> 00:24:08,342
Since your return to the palace,

324
00:24:08,342 --> 00:24:11,185
my suspicion has rose

325
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,478
until the evening of Mid-Autumn celebration

326
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:19,078
You were the one who was eavesdropping

327
00:24:20,885 --> 00:24:25,100
So what? You think I can't admire him too?

328
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:27,721
I feel you don't deserve to admire him at all

329
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:33,865
If I killed you, there will be one less unfaithful woman on earth

330
00:24:34,194 --> 00:24:36,575
If she's hurt anywhere

331
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:38,899
17th Prince will be devastated

332
00:24:39,181 --> 00:24:41,360
All these years, only 17th Prince treats me the best

333
00:24:41,536 --> 00:24:44,086
So anyone who makes him upset shall all die

334
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:48,508
If you killed me, it will only upset him more

335
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:50,898
It's not that I want to kill you

336
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,279
It's all faithful ones out there

337
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:56,264
Have you ever known

338
00:24:56,932 --> 00:25:00,841
that being unfaithful is sometimes more difficult than staying faithful?

339
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,700
Where is this from?

340
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
This red coral bracelet

341
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
is a precious piece that 17th Prince attained from South China Sea

342
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,100
He's never given to anyone

343
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,800
Why is it with you?

344
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,200
You should ask him instead

345
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,000
17th Prince, you don't owe her anything

346
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,800
why are you obsessed with her?

347
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,300
Forget it

348
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,900
Since he has given his heart to you

349
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,400
if you still have some conscientious

350
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,300
you should feel guilty

351
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,600
His little empathy towards me

352
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,700
maybe be nothing to you

353
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,500
But to me

354
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,800
it's incomparable warmth and love

355
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,000
I'll let you go this time

356
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,900
as a form of repayment to his kindness

357
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,300
She's insane

358
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:13,300
Forget it. Ning Guiren also someone grateful

359
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,400
Xi Gui Fei is blessed

360
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,700
Her twins

361
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,300
have earned her a life of good fortune

362
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,400
It's not a feat to bear children

363
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
if she can't raise them up

364
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,000
Qi Meimei seems to put it so simply

365
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,300
Of course

366
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,700
An Pin Jiejie is not the same

367
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,500
Hui Pin avoids you since her pregnancy

368
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,400
If you go to Xi Gui Fei's Palace,

369
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,400
then can her children still live?

370
00:26:40,524 --> 00:26:41,684
Shut up!

371
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,400
All you know is talk

372
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
but don't know how to keep Emperor pleased

373
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,400
Qi Guiren, ever since you're freed from grounding

374
00:26:50,428 --> 00:26:51,884
you haven't been able to get Emperor's favour

375
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,700
An Pin, you've been trapped by astronomical signs for so long

376
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,200
but aren't able to save yourself

377
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,900
You can't help me

378
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,100
yet still create internal conflict

379
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,300
What's the use of keeping the two of you here?

380
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,200
Try harder

381
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,900
If not this harem will be controlled by Zhen Huan

382
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,500
How dare this shrew fight for power with me?

383
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,100
An Pin, you come from a lowly background

384
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,000
and yet in the same position as me for so long

385
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,200
I've tolerated enough

386
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,200
Lady, calming medicine is ready

387
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Have a good night after drinking

388
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,700
Baojuan

389
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,200
Baojuan

390
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,400
My voice

391
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,200
What happened to my voice?

392
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,900
Lady, what happened?

393
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,900
My voice... I can never sing again

394
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,700
Baojuan

395
00:28:21,752 --> 00:28:24,003
Lady, there must be someone who wants to harm you

396
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,700
Lady, I must report to Empress

397
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,900
I'll go ask her for help

398
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,900
Baojuan, you mustn't go

399
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,300
I earned Emperor's favour all based on my voice

400
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,900
If someone found out

401
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,000
then Emperor would never like me again

402
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,100
When that happens, I'll be a useless pawn

403
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,300
A useless pawn

404
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,200
Baojuan, remember, I've only caught a cold

405
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,900
I'll recover very soon

406
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,900
Understood

407
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,000
Look, Niang Niang

408
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,000
Sister

409
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:02,700
Yurao

410
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,565
Young Mistress

411
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,200
Greetings to Niang Niang

412
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,600
Yurao, let me take a look at you

413
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,903
We have been separated for years, we should be happy now

414
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,500
Why are you crying?

415
00:29:15,523 --> 00:29:16,455
Bi Jiejie

416
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Young mistress has grown taller

417
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,700
In order to please Niang Niang,

418
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
Emperor has invited Niang Niang's family into the palace

419
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,500
He also allowed

420
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,400
young mistress to stay in the palace

421
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,200
to accompany Niang Niang

422
00:29:30,506 --> 00:29:31,725
Where are my parents?

423
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,700
Are they coming?

424
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,300
Old master is still recovering

425
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Emperor has allowed your parents to come to Beijing Capital

426
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,300
So as to give you a peace of mind

427
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,900
Young mistress has traveled without stopping to come first

428
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,800
I believe

429
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,300
your parents will arrive very soon

430
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,200
I'm grateful for Emperor's kindness

431
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,800
But my father is still a criminal

432
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,800
Although Emperor shows mercy

433
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,500
and allowed my parents to return

434
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,100
but what's the point

435
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,800
It only caused them tireness and distress

436
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,100
Although Emperor has recovered your father's position

437
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,486
but he has already employed workers to renovate your old house

438
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,000
to renovate your old house

439
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,400
in order to let them stay in the Capital

440
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,000
until their old age

441
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,200
I understand

442
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,900
I will thank Emperor tomorrow

443
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,600
You may leave

444
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,400
Yes. There's one more thing

445
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,200
17th Prince said

446
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,900
as a gift for your promotion,

447
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,800
excluding other gifts,

448
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,200
he will give all pink siris from Ninghui Tang

449
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:26,523
to you

450
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,400
He also said

451
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,600
these flowers can sooth the mind and body

452
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,500
Niang Niang can admire them

453
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,068
or add them into porridge in future

454
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,800
Just don't waste it

455
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:40,284
I appreciate his sincerity

456
00:30:42,304 --> 00:30:44,165
Please thank him on my behalf

457
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,300
This prince has an exquisite taste

458
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,900
He doesn't give common gifts

459
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,700
such as gold and jade

460
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,000
Young mistress has only visited the palace briefly

461
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,000
Actually 17th Prince

462
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,100
still has many other unique skills and interests

463
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
When Niang Niang was away

464
00:31:02,305 --> 00:31:03,555
I have already asked the servants

465
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,200
to clear and tidy a room

466
00:31:05,305 --> 00:31:06,285
for Young Mistress to stay in

467
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:07,949
That's good

468
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,400
Let's all go in

469
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,700
Then Servant leaves first

470
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,300
You've read a whole night

471
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,100
It's hard on you

472
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,000
Xi Gui Fei is busy taking care of her twins

473
00:31:24,464 --> 00:31:25,878
and is not free to serve Emperor

474
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,500
There are many other young consorts in the harem

475
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,800
You should go visit them too

476
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,500
I've heard that An Pin ate something wrong

477
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,100
and ruined her voice

478
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,900
I'm afraid she won't be able to sing again

479
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,100
Such a pity

480
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,300
Initially it's nothing but a cold

481
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,200
and thought she'll recover soon enough

482
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,500
But the medicine hurt her throat instead

483
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,900
I'm afraid she won't be able to speak properly in future

484
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,000
Let her rest well then

485
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,300
I haven't visited Hui Pin in a while

486
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,200
Now that Huan Huan has given birth

487
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,700
There's still Meizhuang's good news

488
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:14,800
Jiejie

489
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,900
Who is it?

490
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,500
Jiejie

491
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,100
Stop

492
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,000
Stop

493
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,000
Greetings to Xi Gui Fei

494
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,900
Long time no see

495
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,600
Have you forgotten me?

496
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,900
That's not the case

497
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,100
But you've become much thinner

498
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,100
I believe you've suffered a lot

499
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,100
I'm used to suffering

500
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,800
and being despised

501
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,300
I'm not afraid of bitterness

502
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,100
Emperor has adviced Meimei to recover in your palace

503
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,900
so as to prevent trouble

504
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,500
Why have you come out?

505
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,400
Others think I'm a jinx

506
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,700
But you know me better

507
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,900
that I'm not truly a jinx

508
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,300
I'm meant nothing

509
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,145
Why do you think

510
00:33:06,145 --> 00:33:07,400
you're a jinx?

511
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,800
The way you belittle yourself

512
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,000
upsets me

513
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,500
Since you aren't well

514
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,700
why still come out?

515
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,400
The state you're in today

516
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,900
is because you've worried too much

517
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,300
I come from a lowly background

518
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,400
I can't help to feel sorry for myself

519
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,700
in comparison to the other concubines

520
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,500
Only I can help myself

521
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,600
That's good

522
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,800
Just don't harm others blindly and risk your life

523
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,500
Greed is a bottomless pit

524
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,500
It can end your life

525
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,500
Nowadays

526
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,500
no one is more powerful than you

527
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
There's no one as helpless as me

528
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,600
Jiejie is the most powerful in the harem now

529
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,600
If you help me,

530
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,800
I will be saved

531
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,500
I won't have to worry if you can help me

532
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,900
Thanks for your reminder

533
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,200
I still remember

534
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,500
how you treated me in the past

535
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,800
thus I will help you as much as I can

536
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,200
I'll never let you down

537
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,800
Me too

538
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,000
Seems that her voice

539
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,400
is really ruined

540
00:34:38,428 --> 00:34:39,927
I wonder if it's the works of heaven or of man

541
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Lady, she has lost favouritism now

542
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,500
Why don't we...

543
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,800
silence her in secret

544
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,800
Within the harem, death is the easiest way out

545
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,200
She has Emperor's favour for many years and she's obstinate

546
00:34:58,356 --> 00:34:59,885
Now that she lost His favour

547
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,400
It's worse than death for her

548
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,900
Understood

549
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,300
I will let all the palaces know about this

550
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,000
and let them treat An Pin nicely

551
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,200
What are you doing?

552
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Wrecking havoc here

553
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,600
Stop

554
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,100
We're doing this for you

555
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,100
Even Emperor thinks you're unlucky

556
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,400
We have made a trip to Bao Huan Dian specially

557
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,800
to get talisman and holy water

558
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,200
Continue

559
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,500
Don't forget the blankets and closet

560
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,300
What are you doing?

561
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,000
Stop it

562
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,900
Are you out of your mind?

563
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,100
Even if Lady is unlucky,

564
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,700
you've no right to come and make nonsense

565
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,900
An Pin's bad luck has affected the Six Palaces

566
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,500
So anyone has the right to take things into their hands

567
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,100
How would talisman work without burning?

568
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,100
Hurry burn them

569
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,100
Lady, Zhen Pin and Kand Chang Zai

570
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,500
have gone to Yanxi Palace

571
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,100
Does Empress know?

572
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,500
I think so

573
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,300
But she made no comments

574
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,100
Nevermind, there will be more nonsense in future

575
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,400
Lady, there is no more charcoal

576
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,600
Can you carry a hot water bottle first?

577
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,900
We're only left with a little hot water

578
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,200
We still need them for drinking and washing

579
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,700
We don't have enough to make a heated bottle

580
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,000
It's snowed again

581
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,600
It's getting colder

582
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,700
I've helped you added as many blankets as I can

583
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,500
If not for the medicine, we would have frozen to death

584
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,600
If we freeze to death

585
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,900
would anyone know?

586
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,800
Lady

587
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,300
How is An Pin?

588
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,600
Zhen Pin and I miss you

589
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,200
What are you doing here again?

590
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,400
Since we're sisters,

591
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,100
knowing that you lack charcoal,

592
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,500
we've brought you some specially

593
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,400
Bring it

594
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:15,800
Ignite

595
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,400
Without charcoal

596
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,900
how are you going to get through this winter?

597
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,300
You've to understand one thing

598
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,400
that time has changed

599
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,400
We don't have any good charcoal

600
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Please bear with what you get

601
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,200
Stop it, we're choking

602
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,600
Hurry, ignite them. It won't heat if you don't

603
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,200
In the name of the owner of Yanxi Palace

604
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,000
I order you to leave

605
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,700
Stop all your nonsense

606
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,200
Do you think you are still a favoured consort?

607
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,800
Save it

608
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,406
Your state right now

609
00:37:49,406 --> 00:37:50,600
is worse than my servant

610
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
Stop ordering us

611
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:54,766
What's all this nonsense

612
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,400
Empress Dowager is sick and needs to rest

613
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,400
Who dares to make noise here?

614
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,500
Empress has heard of what happened in Yanxi Palace

615
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,800
Here's her order: As servants of Yanxi Palace

616
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,500
are unable to protect their Lady

617
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,100
They shall be fined one month's salary

618
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,300
Servants of Kang Chang Zai and Zhen Pin

619
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,000
being unable to prevent their Ladies of mischief,

620
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,900
shall be fined three months' salary

621
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,100
Yes

622
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,600
Hurry leave

623
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,000
Lady please put your mind to rest

624
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,300
Although Niang Niang is also in trouble,

625
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,400
she has never forgotten you

626
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,300
Here's the blankets and charcoal

627
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,600
Please get through this winter at ease

628
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,100
Thank you Her Majesty

629
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,500
Baojuan, accept them

630
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,300
Yes

631
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,800
Ever since Lady lost her voice

632
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,100
Empress hasn't mentioned you

633
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,300
You should think of a new solution

634
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:13,900
Niang Niang

635
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,222
Is everything settled?

636
00:39:16,222 --> 00:39:16,900
Yes

637
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,000
What's the point of improving on perfection?

638
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,600
It's better to give when it's most needed

639
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,200
I've said everything to An Pin

640
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:31,005
Hope she understands

641
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,500
When one has no other choices,

642
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,600
one has nothing to lose

643
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
This is a lesson for her

644
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,800
Since Qi Gui Ren has already made her move

645
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,700
An Pin will never recover her voice anyway

646
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,700
Why don't I end it all for her?

647
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,400
Even Ning Gui Ren's parrot can sing poems

648
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,900
She should think of an alternative

649
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,500
Empress is wise
