1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,000
This is the fresh moisture cream made for Xiao Zhu by the imperial hospital

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,183
even Xiaozhu loses weight

3
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:13,100
your skin won't loose

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,700
put more on then

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,200
It is done.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,800
you go to help me

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,500
what's happening , Xiaozhu?

8
00:00:32,357 --> 00:00:34,260
Xiao Zhu! Xiao Zhu!

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,100
An Pin is fainted at Yanxi Palace

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,000
was a doctor called?

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,083
They did. But when they got there,

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,800
An Pin didn't allow them in

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,000
I heard from the little maid who went to the doctor

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,900
An Pin was painted because of overly food restriction

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,200
Why is she on a diet?

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,708
since she lost the favor

17
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,325
she's been practicing ice skating every day

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,402
An Lingrong has a brain,

19
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:08,900
trying to use this to get the favor

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,089
Qing Emperors in every dynasty

21
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:13,913
all like ice skating

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,700
and have a skating show every year

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,000
and set skating, wrestling, Manchurian, and riding and archery

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,500
as the culture of Qing dynasty

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,751
I heard that some guards of the previous emperors

26
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,000
had become high ranked officers because of skating skills

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,100
How Niangniang respond to this?

28
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:33,544
I don't need to do anything.

29
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:34,901
she's on a way of self destruction

30
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,400
self destruction?

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,300
your maid..., your maid is ignorant...

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,900
if skating is not learnt as a child

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,100
you can't be succesful

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,800
dancing on ice

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,300
requires a dancer's body light as if without bones

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,900
one can't get it in a short time

37
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,400
though An Lingrong is slim

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,800
how could she be as light as cloud

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,500
after these years in the palace?

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,000
No wonder she tries to go on a diet.

41
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,800
Niangniang is exactly right

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,300
diet would hurt appearance yet won't get the result quickly

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,800
it seems she's burning with impatience

44
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,600
there is actually a way to a result immediately

45
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,796
if someone tells her

46
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:18,600
she must've felt like finding a treasure

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,800
absolutely cannot let her know the way

48
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,800
we must let her know!

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,048
Zhao Feiyan became the favorite of Han Cheng Emperor

50
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,423
her body was so light that she could dance on a palm

51
00:02:30,423 --> 00:02:32,700
it was the effect of Muscle Resting Drug

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,801
put it into your belly button

53
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:37,100
it melt inside the body

54
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,641
that would make the skin as white as snow, the body very light

55
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:42,600
and the appearance shines gloriously

56
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,600
only there is musk in it

57
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,600
musk would damage woman's body

58
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,589
not only causes infertility

59
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:56,062
even she's pregnant

60
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:58,500
it would make the fetus die early

61
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,455
An Pin understands spices better than most

62
00:03:02,455 --> 00:03:05,100
she won't be deceived

63
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:06,948
I know

64
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,386
I don't want to deceive her

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,300
it's up to her whether she wants to use it or not

66
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,909
I've heard that

67
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,784
using lamb flower soup wash

68
00:03:15,784 --> 00:03:18,100
could dissolve the poison of musk

69
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,500
would An Pin know this method?

70
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,900
if that has such magic effect

71
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,800
how come Zhao Feiyan was never pregnant

72
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,181
even they had all the power to

73
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,600
wash with all lamb flower soup she needed?

74
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,055
it's good she knows that. she'd think lamb flower is effective

75
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:38,000
she'd be fearless

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,900
has An Pin got the muscle resting drug?

77
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,417
An Pin saw it, and took it without a word

78
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,100
she's obedient

79
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,791
I heard she'd asked the imperial hospital secretly

80
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,786
before Niangniang gave it to her

81
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:53,697
look like she truly doesn't want a child

82
00:03:53,697 --> 00:03:54,830
isn't that good!

83
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,400
so we don't have to try something

84
00:03:56,788 --> 00:03:57,748
right

85
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,600
I feel better using the person without child

86
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,430
the effect of this drug is remarkable

87
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,500
Xiao Zhu looks slimmer these days

88
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,100
only this drug is very severe, I worry

89
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,926
what's there to worry

90
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:17,510
it's New Year's eve tomorrow

91
00:04:18,897 --> 00:04:21,144
I know how much musk it has

92
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,209
I boiled a pot of lamb flower soup

93
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Niangniang takes a soak

94
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:27,604
since I've taken so much various drug soups these years

95
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,200
it's the same whether I'm soak or not

96
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:34,099
Xiao Zhu isn't be able to be pregnant

97
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:36,343
you have to find some way

98
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:38,582
under control of someone

99
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,600
I can't make a decision even for getting pregnant

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
you know how much I hate?

101
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,500
but Bao Juan, I'm helpless

102
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,300
I have to obey the empress

103
00:06:34,005 --> 00:06:35,336
last year's skating was really good

104
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,600
The Neza Made Chaos in Ocean really made me happy

105
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,727
Taizu Emperor was good at walking on ice

106
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:45,800
he walked faster than Calvary in battle

107
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,369
I heard when Emperor was Fourth Prince

108
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:53,600
he won in the riding and archery on ice every year

109
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,000
if headwind could understand, it won't destroy easily

110
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,700
Zhen and you met through plum flower in the past

111
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,700
Huangshang still remembers

112
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,400
there's rhythm in fragrance,

113
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,000
pure to extreme won't feel cold

114
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,219
did Huangshang remember when Sister just came

115
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,900
she often recited this poem

116
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,283
never thought Cunyuan Empress was like me

117
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,100
appreciate the lonely and pure state of plum flower

118
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,900
Cunyuan and you are same kind of naturally pure people

119
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,400
Huangshang, ten thousands happiness

120
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:17,902
your voice is still not recovered?

121
00:11:17,902 --> 00:11:19,541
Chenqie ate something bad

122
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,706
I'm afraid that my voice won't recover

123
00:11:22,437 --> 00:11:24,624
you wear such thin cloth without getting health back

124
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:26,062
your hands are icy cold

125
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,800
Su Peisheng, fetch my marten coat

126
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,000
don't hurt yourself in such cold weather

127
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,600
pity you lost your voice

128
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,000
lose in the east, gain in the west

129
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,499
though An Pin damaged her voice

130
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,161
her dance on ice

131
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
surpassed Feiyan!

132
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,630
Bengong see An Pin can be called

133
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,800
Feiyan on ice

134
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,200
it reminded of Chenqie Xi Guifei's dance of surprised goose

135
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,300
also like a fairy coming down from sky

136
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,700
Xi Guifei's and my lovely consort's

137
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,975
each has its strong point

138
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:14,700
it's my luck I have such a lovely consort

139
00:12:15,622 --> 00:12:18,059
how would I be dared to compare with Xi Guifei?

140
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,381
I, like Dongshi, only imitate Xishi

141
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,700
Zhen forgot to ask, how had you came here?

142
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,400
Chenqie really missed Huangshang

143
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,127
thought I'd be happy

144
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:30,500
if I could just see Huangshang from afar

145
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,700
Chenqie has no luck to serve Huangshang

146
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm lucky to dancing for Huangshang today

147
00:12:38,703 --> 00:12:41,109
since I shouldn't go out

148
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,900
the dance is over, please punish me

149
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,432
Chenqie takes it willingly

150
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,300
it's ok. staying with Zhen for New Year

151
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,900
Yi Guifei had gave birth of a son safely

152
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,000
Ronger, before Hui Pin's deliver

153
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,900
don't go to her Suiyu Pavillion

154
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,100
Chenqie obey imperial direction.

155
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,235
yet Chenqie and Hui Pin sister are like real sisters

156
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:09,035
but can't go to take care of her

157
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:10,700
I feel regret

158
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:18,377
cunning

159
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,400
Long live the Emperor, ten thousand years

160
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:49,900
pick lotus in the river south,

161
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,900
Huangshang has been favoring An Pin these days

162
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:01,164
if this keeps going, promote her to Fei is not far away

163
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,000
it's not easy for her

164
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:06,227
her appearance does not ont top of others

165
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,154
and she came from that kind of family and has no child

166
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,800
she could get such a position.

167
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,100
didn't she just pretend to be pitiful?

168
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,600
yet Huangshang likes it so much

169
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,000
not only Huangshang; all men in the world

170
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:23,821
are all like that

171
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,600
Xiao Zhu had put away this bracelet

172
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:28,220
why did you take it out today?

173
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,000
Huangshang gave this to me

174
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,300
such good thing is rare nowadays

175
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:39,295
you take it to Yanxi Palace in a moment

176
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,900
give it to her

177
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,800
the emeralds of tributes are getting worse year after year

178
00:14:43,176 --> 00:14:45,215
Xiao Zhu wants Nubi to give to her?

179
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,100
Nubi feels pity for such good emeralds

180
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
?what pity or not

181
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:50,689
tell Zhen about it

182
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,200
Huangshang ten thousand happiness and golden peace

183
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,148
servants outside are really ignorant

184
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,800
didn't announce when Huangshang is here

185
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Zhen was afraid you were napping so didn't want to wake you up

186
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,500
didn't expect you two were gossipping

187
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,100
rise

188
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,800
Chenqie is having Huanbi find something

189
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,800
Huangshang takes a look, is it good?

190
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,800
this seems something Zhen gave you last time

191
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,200
you like it too much to wear it

192
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,100
why did you take it out?

193
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,953
precisely because I like it too much to wear

194
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
I'll get it out to give to Sister An

195
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,912
even Huanbi said

196
00:15:31,912 --> 00:15:34,160
if such emerald is not matched with a beauty

197
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,800
it would be pity

198
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,093
the empress has gave her many things,

199
00:15:39,093 --> 00:15:42,200
she's got a lot just from the Internal Affairs Office

200
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,763
what she's got is one thing

201
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,600
what I give to her is another thing

202
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,300
I try to use the thing Huangshang gave to me

203
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,781
to please another

204
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,300
I have to ask whether Huangshang allows or not

205
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,385
Zhen has seen that there is coral bracelet

206
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,100
on your wrist, very pretty

207
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,600
coral is not something expensive

208
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,400
but Sister An likes emerald

209
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:07,303
Chenqie tries to please her

210
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,920
Huangshang tries to get Sister An for

211
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,300
my other things

212
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,400
Ronger came from lower background, and is afraid a lot

213
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,000
too much Pins and Feis in the harem don't like her

214
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,500
only you, treat her as really sisters after this many years

215
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:25,524
it's rare

216
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,400
Huaihuai, there is a thing I've some difficulty

217
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,200
Huaihuai may not solve the problem for Fourth prince

218
00:16:36,682 --> 00:16:37,644
but like to hear

219
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
it's about your parents

220
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,600
they may not come to see you soon

221
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,300
why?

222
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,600
Guaerjia gathered many officials are against it

223
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,900
criticize Zhen lost fairness because of favoring you

224
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,000
in fact, Huangshang has no reason not to know

225
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,600
what happened to my family in the past

226
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:00,361
it's more like a fabricated charge

227
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,500
Huangshang has also had to think about Hongyan's future

228
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,000
can't let his grandfather be a criminal

229
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,200
could Huangshang consider to review the case?

230
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,900
Qi Guiren has no big error in the Harem

231
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,700
Guaerjia clan can't find anything right now

232
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,800
if open up the case in the past

233
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,700
that would shake the court, cause disturbance

234
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,000
Chenqie can wait

235
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,800
Guifei sister-in-law

236
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,500
it's still cold, how come Beile's cloth is so thin?

237
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,200
should put more cloth on

238
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,300
Thanks, Guifei sister-in-law

239
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,000
when I was at Shoukang Palace to see Dowager

240
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:00,704
Dowager also reminded of me

241
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,842
I feel that if it's too warm

242
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,400
that could weaken the will of a person

243
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,400
so I chose some thin cloth

244
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:08,585
Elder sister, I've been looking for you

245
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,700
Hongyan would cry if you don't go back

246
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,584
Haven't met this Xiao Zhu

247
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:15,300
is everyone having a face and head

248
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,700
married to the Emperor? I'm not

249
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:20,431
what marry or not?

250
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,200
words out of a girl's mouth have no subtlety

251
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:25,425
Beile, don't view her as an outsider,

252
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:26,843
she's my little sister

253
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:28,584
Xiaomei doesn't go out much

254
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:30,149
no wonder Beile saw her not familiar

255
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,416
Xiaomei grew up in a remote area

256
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,100
doesn't know much of rules

257
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,800
please don't laugh at her, Beile

258
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,400
hasn't you greeted Beile?

259
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,462
no wonder Prince mistook me for others

260
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:48,545
I can imagine that anyone with a little pretty look

261
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,663
in the Harem would get attention of the Emperor

262
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,200
that's what made Prince thought me as such

263
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,200
Yurao, you're more and more reckless

264
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,042
Guniang is so high-minded and proud that

265
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,700
even views the Emperor and richness as nothing

266
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,741
it looks only the fame of 17th Prince

267
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,300
could mean something for Guniang

268
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,038
what do you mean? is only son of royalty good?

269
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:11,778
I'd rather marry an ordinary man for life

270
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,700
than step in the gates of the palace or royal house

271
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,000
sorry, I underestimated Guniang

272
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,948
my little sister always talks without much thinking

273
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:21,821
not intentionally naughty

274
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:23,200
please don't be offended, Prince

275
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,400
let's go, sister

276
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,706
what has happened today?

277
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:33,626
what's in your mind

278
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,500
that you hold back and can't laugh out?

279
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,400
why would I want to laugh?

280
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,600
you can't hide from me if you have something

281
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
don't hide! tell your 17th elder brother.

282
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,500
saw a girl, big, hot temper

283
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,200
and, look down upon us

284
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,800
what do we have that are good?

285
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,362
merely born in the royal family

286
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:52,331
more likely than not that the brothers are trying to

287
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,000
kill each other, and many were rid of their status

288
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,200
nothing can be envied

289
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,103
don't say these depressing words, 17th brother

290
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,985
go, let's race!

291
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:02,300
let's go

292
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:20,943
Niangniang, Dr. Wen is here to check you

293
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
has him in, quickly

294
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,200
Weichen greet Niangniang

295
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,200
don't stand on ceremony

296
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,800
How is the pregnancy of Sister Mei?

297
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,400
Hui Pin is expecting in less than half month

298
00:20:46,214 --> 00:20:48,574
she's been calm for months, and the fetus seems fine

299
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,700
though what you said is same each time

300
00:20:53,476 --> 00:20:54,334
I feel better each time I heard it

301
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,900
so many old acquaintances have passed away

302
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,869
these years, it's fortunate you're still here

303
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:08,103
yes, it's fortunate that the close acquaintances are here still

304
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,200
by the way, Uncle Zhen is getting better

305
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,900
Weichen will go to see him when free, be as ease

306
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:31,031
Bengong are not easy to go out due to the rule, please look after my father

307
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,300
after Hui Pin gives birth safely

308
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,400
Weichen'll visit your father more

309
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,300
elder sister

310
00:21:45,699 --> 00:21:49,589
second miss runs so fast, be careful

311
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:52,720
Jingxi will take care here, you can go now

312
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Xiaoyunzi is playing paper crane with Hongyan. it's interesting. would sister want to go to see?

313
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,640
greeting to Guifei Niangniang

314
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,400
Su Gonggong

315
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:11,300
huangshang said to go to see Sixth Ahge with Niangniang in the afternoon

316
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,300
okay, sorry Su Gonggong had to make a trip to tell me

317
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,893
Niangniang is polite. isn't Bi Guniang here?

318
00:22:19,942 --> 00:22:23,622
good, otherwise she'll have heart ache if she knew

319
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:29,000
Niangniang knew that 17th Prince is not in good health, has fever often

320
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,800
doctor's diagnose is cold air invaded his body

321
00:22:32,821 --> 00:22:38,343
no one expected he fell from the horse yesterday when he went to ride with Beile Shen and the horse was upset

322
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,195
he didn't hurt much

323
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:43,525
only his temperature was very high at the midnight

324
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,700
Nucai have to report to Dowager so that Dowager would be at ease

325
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,200
such a big thing, how come no one told me?

326
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,287
Niangniang is busy in managing the affairs of the Harem

327
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:03,400
How could we bother Niangniang with this? furthermore, Empress takes care of the royal household

328
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:08,777
right. Bengong thought

329
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,300
Empress just recovered, and has to take care of Dowager. that's why I asked about it

330
00:23:14,374 --> 00:23:18,424
Niangniang's virtues spread through the Harem, naturally concern about the royal household

331
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:23,819
even Niangniang didn't ask for yourself, should do it for Bi Guniang

332
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:26,494
you hurry up

333
00:23:26,658 --> 00:23:28,215
Nucai is withdrawn

334
00:23:34,898 --> 00:23:37,854
Yurao, I'm tired

335
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,100
you go playing with Hongyan and Lingxi

336
00:23:46,422 --> 00:23:49,458
could bother you once?

337
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:55,197
if it's not you go to see him, I can't be at ease

338
00:23:55,818 --> 00:23:57,705
you still can't put this away?

339
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,600
that his body invaded by cold wind was caused by me. I owe him too much

340
00:24:05,698 --> 00:24:10,142
view this as paying him some back for me

341
00:24:24,135 --> 00:24:26,601
you worry about his health

342
00:24:28,864 --> 00:24:31,389
go to see him

343
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,898
something I couldn't do, it's good that you can

344
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:37,343
one more person would be at ease

345
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:44,567
really? the question is how can I get out?

346
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,200
you go to see Su Peisheng,

347
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:52,420
he can arrange for you. go

348
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,800
are there words Xiao Zhu want to bring to the Prince?

349
00:25:09,117 --> 00:25:13,337
I don't . you go

350
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,700
Huaner. ---Prince

351
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:20,737
Ahjin, Prince is awake, bring tea here

352
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,300
Wangye, you are awake

353
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:29,660
Wangye

354
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,800
did Huaner ask you to come?

355
00:26:33,031 --> 00:26:36,985
no, I beg Su Gonggong to let me come

356
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:44,860
thanks for your care these days

357
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,700
lots of things in the Harem, you go help Huaner, it's not convenient with her alone

358
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:54,046
no rush, Jinxi is there

359
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,200
Wangye is ill. if I didn't take good care of Wangye, no one would be at ease, and I would waste my chance of coming out

360
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,093
it's up to you

361
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,000
how come didn't Huangshang come to the Harem lately

362
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,800
too many things at the court, plus set a new office, Huangshang is too busy

363
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:28,689
no wonder

364
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:32,689
Empress looks more spirited

365
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:37,814
I heard Qi Guiren had a nun from outside to talk about the scripture

366
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:41,488
why? the monks from Baohua Temple are not good?

367
00:27:41,685 --> 00:27:44,937
I heard that Qi Guiren kept saying that she didn't feel well

368
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:49,689
always saw the masters from Baohua who made her tired

369
00:27:49,816 --> 00:27:53,645
she probably invited some masters from the royal temple

370
00:27:55,265 --> 00:27:59,809
Nubi should've paid more attention to these

371
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,409
but early this morening Empress sent me to teach new maids

372
00:28:04,456 --> 00:28:07,489
didn't expect it took whole day and haven't looked other things

373
00:28:07,565 --> 00:28:08,618
also, Su Peisheng said today

374
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:14,400
Wangye's fever is gone

375
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,500
but needs a few more days to rest

376
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:22,169
Huanbi Guniang needs to be there for a few more days

377
00:28:23,497 --> 00:28:27,857
I envy Huanbi sometimes

378
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:30,376
Sister envies because Huanbi can go out of the palace?

379
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,336
I see that though Yongshou Palace is large

380
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:37,296
the sky can be seen is square, not as free as outside the palace

381
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:41,573
yes, I envy that Huanbi can go out from time to time

382
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:46,222
Sister don't think I'm busy playing, I'm willingly here to be with you

383
00:28:47,113 --> 00:28:54,530
this balsam is new from the garden, called Carmine, it's very pretty to put on fingernail

384
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,900
it's not easy for them to having it out in Spring, it looks very good on Sister

385
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:05,452
Greetings to Guifei Niangniang

386
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,500
rise

387
00:29:08,656 --> 00:29:12,772
Empress Niangniang asks you to go to Jingren Palace right away

388
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:14,219
for what matter?

389
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:19,259
it's important. Niangniang asks Empress Niangniang, it's not convenient for Nucai to reply

390
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,600
prepare sedan chair

391
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:35,372
Wangye is just getting better, be careful not to catch cold again

392
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,656
thanks a lot

393
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:42,015
if Wangye thanks me, that treats me as a stranger

394
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:45,132
you look that kite

395
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:47,474
it seems fly so high

396
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:49,812
but only hangs by a thread

397
00:29:50,025 --> 00:29:52,296
how insecure it is

398
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,292
didn't know Wangye likes to watch kite

399
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:01,600
no, I feel the situation Huaner in is like a kite

400
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:06,008
I'm fine, Huanbi

401
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:07,817
you go back to help Huaner

402
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,200
Wangye don't need to worry

403
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,000
Niangniang has Huangshang, and Huangshang's child. she's nothing to be afraid of

404
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,600
Qi Guiren, you insisted on accuse Xi Guifei, and wanted Bengong having everyone in the Harem here, for what matter?

405
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:32,092
Chenqie want to expose Xi Guifei has an affair, promiscuous in the Harem, the crime deserves to die

406
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,980
palace rules are strict, Qi Guiren can't make irresponsible accusation!

407
00:30:39,093 --> 00:30:43,388
if Chenqie lie, let me die hit by thunder, never have bereincarnated

408
00:30:43,418 --> 00:30:46,330
that's what you swore on?

409
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:48,980
who would know what happen after death?

410
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,867
swore on such illusory thing,

411
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:55,596
Qi Guiren is obviously not serious

412
00:30:57,172 --> 00:31:02,530
Chenqie swears on the Guaerjia clan that if Chenqie lie, the whole clan would have no descendants

413
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:06,331
you say that Xi Guifei has an affair,

414
00:31:06,543 --> 00:31:08,609
who is the adultery?

415
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,700
Doctor Wen Shichu

416
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Wen Shichu is a confidant of Xi Guifei, and checks her pulse everyday

417
00:31:20,617 --> 00:31:23,819
it's possible they feel for each other

418
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,400
furthermore, when Xi Guifei first came to Harem, she was ill for a while, and it was Dr. Wen made diagnosis

419
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,693
Kang Changzai has a good memory. the crime started at the very beginning

420
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:43,612
How could two sisters make a guess like that? Xi Guifei was seriously ill when she first came, and Dr. Wen went to see Xi Guifei

421
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:48,860
not only he's very good but his family knows Sister's family well

422
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:55,200
it's reasonable to care for her, where this affair thing came from?

423
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:58,579
from what you said, they've known each other since childhood

424
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,800
it looks what Qi Guiren said could have some credit

425
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:06,881
what evidence you have for the nonsense several of you said?

426
00:32:06,983 --> 00:32:08,943
of course, Chenqie has evidence

427
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,700
Wen Shichu had proposed to Xi Guifei before she came to the Palace

428
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:21,740
Qi Guiren, you sit first.

429
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,500
Nubi greet Empress

430
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,584
speaking with your head raised

431
00:32:37,312 --> 00:32:38,908
Piner

432
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,900
you're Piner

433
00:32:43,914 --> 00:32:46,742
Xi Guifei recognizes her

434
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,000
she' the wife of Chensi in my parents' house. when Zhen family was exiled, all their servants were sold

435
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,000
she'd starve to death if not for my parents that bought her

436
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,000
Piner, stand and speak if you have anything to say. --- Nubi not dare

437
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:07,300
stop nonsense. when you worked at Zhen House, did Wen Shichu propose to your eldest miss?

438
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:14,200
did Wen Shichu propose to your eldest miss, that is, the current Xi Guifei?

439
00:33:17,903 --> 00:33:21,261
you've to speak louder in front of Empress, didn't Chensi tell you?

440
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:27,200
Dr. Wen did propose to Wen's a half month before she entered the palace; but

441
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:32,300
he didn't say to Master and Madame

442
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:38,747
he said to Xi Guifei privately

443
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,700
did Xi Guifei accept? --- no, no

444
00:33:46,088 --> 00:33:48,019
Chenqie thought

445
00:33:48,212 --> 00:33:53,371
if Xi Guifei had her heart on Dr. Wen, she wouldn't be in the Harem today

446
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:59,001
it's obvious that Xi Guifei has clear conscience and didn't have affair with Dr. Wen

447
00:33:59,056 --> 00:34:03,021
Xi Guifei didn't have high regard for an imperial doctor then;

448
00:34:03,172 --> 00:34:07,809
but how could Dr. Wen propose if Xi Guifei didn't show any affection?

449
00:34:07,973 --> 00:34:11,373
there must've exist some feelings from the childhood

450
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,700
Chenqie don't believe feeling from childhood

451
00:34:13,793 --> 00:34:16,014
only believe destiny set by heaven

452
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:19,213
fated gathering, even torturous,

453
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:22,693
won't be changed by human interference

454
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:33,400
Qi Guiren, Bengong knew you hold grudges against Xi Guifei; but you can't spread such vicious nonsense

455
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:37,975
if it's like you said that Xi Guifei and Dr. Wen had affair

456
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:40,173
they would want to hide and not let others know

457
00:34:40,307 --> 00:34:44,056
others will know unless you didn't do

458
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,000
things are done more, someone would see

459
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,100
Feiwen, the little maid from Yongshou Palace, has seen a few times

460
00:34:51,344 --> 00:34:55,708
Feiwen, when did you see, and what did you see?

461
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:00,200
tell Bengong everything clearly

462
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Niangniang and Dr. Wen were talking in room alone on a day,

463
00:35:06,556 --> 00:35:12,217
Nubi accompanying Second Miss entered the room and saw

464
00:35:12,335 --> 00:35:18,177
Dr. Wen's hand held Niangniang's hand, and sat and facing each other,

465
00:35:18,255 --> 00:35:22,857
Dr. Wen withdrew his hand when he saw Nubi

466
00:35:23,068 --> 00:35:27,578
Nubi also saw Dr. Wen's sleeve was rolled up

467
00:35:27,621 --> 00:35:33,061
and embroidered a five bamboo-leaf

468
00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:35,896
I was scared that Niangniang would kill me if she knew what I saw

469
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,400
so I begged Qi Guiren to protect me

470
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:44,300
you little maid saw such thing

471
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,000
wouldn't this happen a lot when you didn't see

472
00:35:48,782 --> 00:35:51,378
this is a big thing

473
00:35:51,598 --> 00:35:54,941
ask Dr. Wen come to Jingren Palace

474
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,000
Xiao zhu is expecting; Dowager said that can't let you know anything outside

475
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:06,290
out of way; involving Xi Guifei, I have to go to see.

476
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:12,059
this would reach Huangshang; no matter what, Huangshang would help Guifei; Niangnian'd better be at ease

477
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:18,100
you still have time to go if something happens; your baby is more important

478
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:23,101
allright

479
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:33,684
Jiang Gonggong

480
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:39,371
Wen Daren, Empress Niangniang asks you to come to Jingren Palace immediately

481
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:43,738
Xiaguan never serves Jingren Palace, don't know why Empress Niangniang calls me?

482
00:36:43,805 --> 00:36:45,372
that has to ask yourself

483
00:36:45,483 --> 00:36:47,965
Wen Daren, please

484
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:04,083
haven't check Hui Pin Niangniang's pulse

485
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,000
it would be enormous if Dowager's order didn't carry out

486
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,100
what do you want to do?

487
00:37:10,206 --> 00:37:14,535
allow Xiaguan to check her pulse before going to Jingren Palace

488
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:16,367
okay

489
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:36,645
Niangniang's date is near

490
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:40,565
Weichen added a few more herbs in your prescription

491
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:46,500
to assure that everything goes smoothly when Niangniang gives birth

492
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,200
you seem in hurry; are you going somewhere?

493
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,500
Imperial hospital needs more drugs and send Weichen to purchase

494
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:01,000
it's windy. don't go out; don't get cold

495
00:38:01,286 --> 00:38:04,886
go, but come back quickly

496
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:08,980
I have something important that I need you

497
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,000
report to Niangniang, Dr. Wen is here

498
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:33,328
Greetings to Empress Niangniang. greetings to every Xiaozhu

499
00:38:33,366 --> 00:38:35,449
rise

500
00:38:36,932 --> 00:38:40,088
forgive me, Wen Daren

501
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,600
this embroidery is elegant, you always have it?

502
00:38:50,737 --> 00:38:55,769
Weichen's mother likes bamboo, so all Weichen's sleeves have a bamboo leaves embroidered by my mother

503
00:38:55,895 --> 00:38:59,130
to express her feelings to me

504
00:38:59,331 --> 00:39:01,008
Empress Niangniang

505
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:06,648
Chenqie thought the embroidery on Dr. Wen's sleeve is not just for a day or two

506
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,793
any careful person could see

507
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:13,886
this couldn't say anything

508
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:21,200
it's strange. how come a small doctor saw Guifei as if come to his own house, talking face to face

509
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:29,000
if like this in future, if doctor can roll up sleeve or unbutton his cloth in Guifei's room, what he couldn't do?

510
00:39:31,277 --> 00:39:36,726
Guifei asked Weichen about Hui Pin's baby's position on that day

511
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,900
when heard everything was good, she was happy and granted me tea

512
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,800
I lost the ceremony when I took the tea and rolled my sleeve

513
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,500
if Xi Guifei is not because she doesn't trust anyone but you

514
00:39:50,768 --> 00:39:54,809
how could she ask you to take care of Hui Fei who is like her sister?

515
00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:59,490
it looks Xi Guifei has special feeling toward you

516
00:39:59,646 --> 00:40:01,570
Xiaozhu, you...
