00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Episode 63

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,600
Looks like the friendship between Lady Xi and you

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,300
Is truly unusual

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,100
Mistress, you-

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,000
Feiwen, while you've been here in the palace

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,100
I never thought you would have those thoughts

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,200
I, the servant who serves you,

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,100
should I have any thoughts, it's of you.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,700
Despite serving you in the palace,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,700
I can only be loyal to the Emperor.

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,800
If I have offended you, please forgive me.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,000
If being loyal to the Emperor means offending me

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,900
you're labelling me as disloyal and unfaithful.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,400
Please allow me to ask her something.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,600
Fei Wen, no matter how this turns out today...

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,300
you're not to return to Yong Shou Palace

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,500
and serve me again.

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,700
As long as I can work in this palace,

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,700
regardless of which mistress I serve

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,600
I'll go through fire and water for her.

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,200
Very well. We were master and servant once.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,300
Since you're exposing my private matters today,

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,700
I assume you know this will be the last time

24
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,300
you serve me.

25
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,100
You should have done your errands prior to this.

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,100
Let me ask, before you came out today

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,800
my glass vase on the rosewood table in the main hall

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,500
did you clean it?

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,300
Yes

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,500
Nonsense.

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,000
When was there ever a glass vase on the rosewood table?

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,000
It's unmistakably a jade vase.

33
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,800
Oh right! It's jade.

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,800
It seems like Feiwen's memory is not very good.

35
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,400
It's hard for you

36
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
but you still remember the pattern on the cuffs of Dr Wen's robe.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,400
I remember now. It was definitely a jade vase.

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,000
On my rosewood table

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,300
I've never had any glass vase.

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,500
You serve me

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,700
but you're not focused on important matters

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,500
rather, you're more concerned with the doctor's hands.

43
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,200
Take my hand

44
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,900
What's the pattern on my cuffs?

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Details like this

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,700
other people don't dare to look at.

47
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,400
You seem to have some kind of suspicious motive

48
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,400
Day and night I only care about the important matters.

49
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't pay attention to anything else.

50
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,300
If Dr. Wen and Xi Guifei are really having an affair

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,700
of course other people would oppose it.

52
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,600
Feiwen remembers everything

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,700
and remembers it so clearly

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,300
Could it be that Feiwei

55
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,200
has been observing Xi Guifei's every word and action, even when they don't concern her?

56
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,800
This girl really has.

57
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,800
You dare to watch her every day.

58
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Empress niang niang,

59
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,300
This feels strange to me.

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,700
like someone behind the curtain is responsible

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
I don't believe what this servant is saying.

62
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,600
I'm afraid there is a larger plot behind all of this.

63
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,200
I have doubt

64
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Qi Guiren lives in Jiaolu palace(?)

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,700
Feiwen is yongshou palace's servant

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,200
Since everyone knows

67
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,800
Qi guiren has never respected Xi Guifei

68
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,700
Why would Yongshou palace's servant

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,300
together with Qi guiren

70
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,900
bring forth this matter to the empress?

71
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
If Feiwen spoke the truth

72
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,300
and one day Xi Guifei were to harm her

73
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,600
then nobody would know about

74
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,300
this whole messy incident.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,600
So it's understandable

76
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,500
that she would go to Qi Guiren about this.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,200
I heard that those who pray have kinder hearts.

78
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,900
They wouldn't even kill an ant.

79
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,800
Noble Consort Xi was at Ganlu Temple

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,300
to pray for our kingdom.

81
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,200
With Guanyin Pusa's protection she bore children.

82
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,000
How would she do such terrible things.

83
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,800
The temple is a place for people to meditate and pray.

84
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,600
Zhen Huan has cheap personality by nature

85
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,000
Precious, Ganlu Temple is our kingdom's temple.

86
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,800
Precious says such insulting and nonsensical words

87
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,600
are you not afraid of Guanyin Pusa punishing you?

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,100
The emperor has arrived

89
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,500
Greetings, Emperor.

90
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,600
There is never a peaceful day in the palace.

91
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,900
We have disturbed you.

92
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,500
Please forgive us.

93
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,900
Tell me what's going on.

94
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
I'll inform you. Xi Guifei's affair is the cause of this ruckus.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,700
Slut! That's nonsense.

96
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,200
I swear on my life!

97
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,900
I'm telling the truth!

98
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,000
Qi guiren took an oath in front of us

99
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,700
It seems maybe there is something going on

100
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,900
If there's some understanding, maybe we should figure it out.

101
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,600
If rumors get out

102
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,900
it could hurt Qi Guifei's reputation.

103
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,700
Ok, then I'll listen.

104
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,800
If you're lying I won't let you off easily.

105
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,500
I have proof

106
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,400
She's having relations with Dr. Wen Shichu

107
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,000
After Xi Guifei left the palace,

108
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,000
Dr. Wen went repeatedly to Gan Lusi to visit her.

109
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,000
A man and woman together in a room

110
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
If you don't believe me

111
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,000
Ask the women from Ganlusi.

112
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:39,453
The person is in the palace.

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,800
If you want to call for her it's up to your Majesty.

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
Send for her.

115
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,600
Huan Bi Jiejie, is the 17th prince's illness better?

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,200
Yes he's doing much better

117
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,200
Where is my mistress?

118
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,700
Why haven't I seen her for so long?

119
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,200
Servant Jiang took her somewhere

120
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,600
She still isn't back

121
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Huan Bi it's so good that you're here.

122
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,200
I have something urgent to tell you

123
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,000
Qi Guiren asked the woman from Ganlusi

124
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,600
to come testify that Xi Guifei is cheating on the Emperor

125
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,400
What?

126
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,200
What should we do?

127
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
We should get someone from Ganlusi

128
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,500
to come testify that it's a lie.

129
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,800
How could my sister have an affair?

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The Emperor is really confused.

131
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
We need to find Mu Yan from Ganlusi.

132
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,300
Mistress, we must go quickly.

133
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,700
Ok, I'll go with Xiao Yunzi.

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,800
You stay here in case anything else happens.

135
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,800
A lu, you work for Ning Guiren.

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,100
Wait by the palace doors to greet her.

137
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:37,700
Okay.

138
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,400
Hurry, Xiao Yunzi.

139
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Yes.

140
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,000
What are you in such a hurry for?

141
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,800
Don't get in my way.

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,800
Something's happened to my sister. I have to save her. Let's go!

143
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,700
What's going on?

144
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,500
I am a nun from Ganlusi. My name is Jing Bai.

145
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,100
Greetings, Emperor and Empress.

146
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,300
Greetings Xi Guifei.

147
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,500
Long time no see.

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,200
I'm not sure if you still remember me.

149
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,200
Master Jingbai, you've made it to the palace.

150
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
It seems you're feeling better.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,600
The spanks rewarded by Noble Consort Xi

152
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,300
has taught me to speak the truth.

153
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,500
I hope so.

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,800
JinBai what do you have to say?

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,400
You should hurry back so we don't hold you up.

156
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,000
Right.

157
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,000
When Xi Guifei first came to Ganlusi,

158
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,400
she ignored everyone.

159
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,400
We just respectfully kept a distance from her.

160
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,400
There was often an older woman

161
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,800
who came to see Xi Guifei.

162
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,600
There was also a doctor named Dr. Wen

163
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,100
who often came to see her.

164
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,700
Several times I passed by Xi Guifei's place

165
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,100
In the middle of the day her door was often closed

166
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,700
and there were two servants outside guarding the door.

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,800
It seemed inappropriate to me

168
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,500
so I wanted to tell Xi Guifei

169
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,300
but she would send me away

170
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,800
So I felt I shouldn't say anything.

171
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,000
Later I heard a rumor in the temple.

172
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,900
that Noble Consort Xi was ill and left Ganlu Temple

173
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,700
to live at Lingyun Feng with a serving girl.

174
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,100
From then on

175
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,300
I don't know if she had contact with him.

176
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,300
Priestess, the doctor Wen you were talking about,

177
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,000
is he in this room?

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,200
Ahmetuofuo. It is this man in front of me.

179
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,800
Priestess you wouldn't recognize the wrong person?

180
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Men rarely come to our temple

181
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,700
Dr. Wen came often, I can't forget him.

182
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,400
Emperor, this is making my head hurt. I want to go rest.

183
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,400
Priestess meditates at Ganlu Temple?

184
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,600
Yes.

185
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,900
Those who meditate are peaceful.

186
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,400
It has been a rough journey from Gan Lu Temple.

187
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
I want to ask something from priestess.

188
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,400
I want to worship a wish lantern

189
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,300
at Gan Lu Temple.

190
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,900
I wonder, how many pounds would do it.

191
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,300
Amitabha.

192
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,700
Someone who practises Buddhism should never get involved with world matters...

193
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,500
Your humble nun, I, have only stepped into the Palace once two years ago,

194
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,700
to send a handwritten copy of the Diamond Sutra.

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,200
And have never stepped foot into the Palace.

196
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,000
Mistress receives the Emperor's love

197
00:09:39,223 --> 00:09:40,969
The worship requires one of the Da Hai Lantern...

198
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,100
But My Lady's position is only at Noble...

199
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,700
Two to three pounds daily should be enough.

200
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,700
Thank you.

201
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,900
Emperor, I'm going now.

202
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,500
Emperor, Doctor Wen's frequent visits to Ganlu Temple

203
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,400
was that directed by you?

204
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,200
If it was your intentions

205
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,900
then this can be forgiven.

206
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,800
Emperor, Concubine Xi's place of residence is indeed deserted...

207
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,800
But there is Huanbi and JingXi

208
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,200
who can be my witness.

209
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,200
Niangniang and I are truly innocent.

210
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,300
Does doctor Wen think we are stupid?

211
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,900
Who doesn't know that Jingxi and Huanbi

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,100
are on Noble Consort Xi's side?

213
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,900
How can their testimonies count?

214
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,100
Wen Shi Chu and Zhen Huan have been childhood sweethearts.

215
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,900
After they came in the palace they shared secret glances.

216
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,800
When Zhenhuan left the palace Wenshi went to visit.

217
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,200
Both of them dated secretly.

218
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,900
Zhenhuan arranged to live Lingyun Feng by herself

219
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,200
so they could be like a couple.

220
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,100
Once Zhenhuan returned to the palace

221
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,700
the two in the main room

222
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,200
acted in disgrace.

223
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,965
Emperor, I have served in the palace for over ten years.

224
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,900
Noble Consort Xi

225
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,000
is not necessarily the first mistress I served.

226
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,800
Nor the one

227
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,100
I served for the longest time.

228
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,700
So, there's no need for me to be biased towards her.

229
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,300
I can calmly say

230
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,200
a fair and justified sentence.

231
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,700
There is absolutely nothing going on between Xi Guifei and Dr. Wen.

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,300
Did you have relations with him?

233
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,200
No

234
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,700
Emperor, Precious Qi and Noble Consort Xi

235
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,400
have the habit of harboring resentment.

236
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,300
They're merely cooking a story up.

237
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,000
Physician Wen has been paying Concubine Xi more frequent visits...

238
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,900
It is because he is a doctor.

239
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,500
If this is a reason for gossip

240
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,000
then us

241
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,500
consorts who have been healed by doctor Wen

242
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
won't we have to defend ourselves now?

243
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,800
That's enough. I believe Xi Guifei.

244
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,700
Emperor, if you want to prove that Xi Guifei is innocent

245
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,900
you should investigate further

246
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,100
to prevent rumors in the future.

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,100
Jiejie has born children for the Emperor.

248
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,800
And handles matters in the harem.

249
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,400
If she doesn't have accomplishments at least she has worked hard.

250
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,900
Emperor, you must investigate this further.

251
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,500
then it will prevent difficulties from us sisters.

252
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,700
This event will affect the relationships between us.

253
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
When Noble Consort Xi was at Ganlu Temple

254
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,800
you didn't even go see her.

255
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,300
We had to have doctor Wen go in our place.

256
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,900
Xi Guifei returned to the palace pregnant.

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,200
She got pregnant outside of the palace.

258
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Your Majesty didn't go visit Noble Consort Xi that much

259
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,900
and according to priestess Bai

260
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,000
doctor Wen was the one seeing her.

261
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,700
Then Noble Consort Xi's children...

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,200
Precious Qi's words imply

263
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,300
that the prince and princess aren't of royal birth?

264
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,300
This has to do with our kingdom.

265
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,200
Precious Qi how can you say such nonsense?

266
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,300
Emperor, you mustn't listen

267
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,300
to Precious Qi's claims.

268
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,900
Precious Qi's statements are not backed up with evidence.

269
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,100
All of you love to parrot others.

270
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,100
I don't allow you to say such things.

271
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,600
Parroting.

272
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,400
You are saying that Precious Qi's assertions

273
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,200
have been circulating around the palace?

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
These women have too much time on their hands and nothing to do.

275
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,500
Often they hear rumors and spread them around.

276
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
You shouldn't worry about it.

277
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,500
Spread rumors

278
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,400
Tell me, what rumors are there?

279
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,100
If there are really rumors that threaten the harmony of the harem

280
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,300
As the head of the harem

281
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,600
why don't you take care of these issues quickly?

282
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,200
Noble Consort Xi came into the palace pregnant and gave birth prematurely.

283
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,800
Everyone says that where the babies came from is unknown,

284
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,900
and isn't necessarily of royal blood.

285
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,000
So I didn't easily believe it.

286
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,900
Noble Consort Xi's premature delivery was because of the scare she had with the cats.

287
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,500
Who could have predicted it?

288
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,800
Also, Noble Consort Xi's health has always been weak.

289
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
Longyue was born after eight months.

290
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,000
This proves the rumors are false.

291
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,400
I also think so.

292
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,700
The stray cats suddenly coming out to scare someone in the palace

293
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,500
and it so happened that it was Noble Consort Xi's sedan.

294
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,600
If someone wanted to frame her

295
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,600
then why would Noble Consort Xi not investigate it or say anything about it?

296
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,600
Unless it was Noble Consort Xi

297
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:21,993
who wanted to use it as an excuse.

298
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,000
I also think it is strange.

299
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,800
On the day that Niangniang gave birth

300
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,000
Before Niangniang fainted doctor Wen

301
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,200
asked her about saving the baby or the adult.

302
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,200
I was confused.

303
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,900
This question should be asked by the Emperor or Empress Dowager.

304
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,200
Why would he ask Niangniang.

305
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,900
I also heard something about "ten years of feelings"

306
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,700
and "giving up versus not giving up".

307
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,700
Empress is the head of the harem.

308
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,600
May I ask what the punishment is for having an affair?

309
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,000
Emperor.

310
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,100
Because Noble Consort Xi is sixth prince's mother

311
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,800
please adjust the punishment.

312
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,800
Noble Consort Xi becoming pregnant outside the palace and returning

313
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,200
already creates a lot of suspicion.

314
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,800
The people who stay at Noble Consort Xi's side

315
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,700
are only Jingxin and Huanbi.

316
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
In my opinion

317
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,800
a good beating will result in answers.

318
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,200
How dare you. Interrogation frequently involves innocent people

319
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,400
and there's no reason to use such a severe method of questioning.

320
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,200
Emperor, Empress,

321
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,700
At this point the only way is to interrogate Jingxin and Huanbi

322
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,500
or else

323
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,700
we can only let Noble Consort Xi and doctor Wen suffer.

324
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,000
People are made of flesh.

325
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,400
If we don't use interrogation how will we know?

326
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,700
If we can use the 72 method of interrogation

327
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,300
and the testimony doesn't change

328
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,100
then there's reason to believe them.

329
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,900
If they really suffer through the 72 methods of interrogation

330
00:15:35,261 --> 00:15:37,343
then they will become paralyzed if not die.

331
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,400
Even if it returns their innocence what good will it serve?

332
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,000
Emperor, in order to protect Niangniang's innocence

333
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,200
I am willing to suffer any interrogation.

334
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,400
But, Noble Consort Xi has a precious body

335
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,000
and cannot be attended to sloppily.

336
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,600
So please don't punish miss Huanbi.

337
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,300
Jiejie.

338
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,700
I know that you care for Huanbi and Jingxin.

339
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,100
But if they aren't interrogated

340
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,900
then jiejie will be in a difficult position.

341
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,500
If your heart hurts, just bear with it.

342
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,600
But Huanbi is with jiejie all day long.

343
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,600
Why is she not here?

344
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,700
17th lord has been sick for many days.

345
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,600
Huanbi went to Guojin estate to care for him.

346
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,200
So she is not in the palace.

347
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,200
Your Majesty, if we force her to come back because of such matters

348
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,900
perhaps the lords and relatives will become alerted.

349
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,400
The situation hasn't been stabilized, it shouldn't be made known.

350
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,600
Don't spread it?

351
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,300
I already know.

352
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,900
Royal brother forgive me.

353
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,000
I came in to greet Empress Dowager

354
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,600
So I came to see what what going on.

355
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,700
Who knew that I would hear all of this from outside.

356
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,200
I cam here to represent the relatives

357
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,000
to say that I would like to on behalf of Noble Consort Xi, the prince, and princess

358
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,800
promise that since Noble Consort Xi arrived in the palace

359
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,200
doing my best and handling their matters personally.

360
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,200
So I would like to believe in Noble Consort Xi.

361
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,800
Baylor Sheng has upheld high moral standards...

362
00:17:08,131 --> 00:17:10,050
You don't like to talk to the consorts in the harem.

363
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,500
Today

364
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,200
how can you say so many good things about Noble Consort Xi?

365
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Handling matters personally and thoroughly?

366
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,600
It's as though the lord has seen it with his own eyes.

367
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,300
It doesn't have to be with my own eyes

368
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,900
Concubine Qi personally attended to various matters..

369
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,000
Look... Her status is low,

370
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,600
anyone could see how exhausting it must be for her.

371
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
On the other hand, Precious Qi looks well-maintained.

372
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,200
It's obvious she's someone who lives in comfort without working at all.

373
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,100
-You<br>-Shut up!

374
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,500
It's nice to have Baylor Shen to speak up for you.

375
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
But the Sixth Prince is of royalty,

376
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,800
and the Emperor has just pinned high hopes on him.

377
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,500
This matter is important for many generations.

378
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:43,436
We have to be meticulous.

379
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,400
Then you tell me how we can be meticulous.

380
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,000
We have to use the blood recognizing method.

381
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,000
I heard the imperial doctors say this in the past

382
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,800
that using blood to recognize relatives

383
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,300
is to have two people's blood

384
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,300
pricked and mixed in a vessel

385
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,400
to see if they blend together.

386
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,000
If they blend together they are related.

387
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,900
or else they are not related.

388
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,800
This method is not difficult.

389
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,300
It just requires harming the precious body to gather the blood.

390
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,500
I fear using this method.

391
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,000
This method should not be used.

392
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,600
How can we hurt the Emperor's royal body?

393
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,200
Has my brother ever thought about

394
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,600
if Hongye and you use blood recognition

395
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,500
even if it proves he is your child

396
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,000
when Hongye finds out

397
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,800
it will hurt the father-son relationship.

398
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,000
Should Emperor bro really did pin high hopes on Hong Yan, people would want to know the truth.

399
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,700
It's exactly this, due to high hopes and expectations...

400
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,000
So we cannot not try.

401
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,600
Should there be anything amissed,

402
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,200
Emperor would be entrusting the kingdom upon a wrong person,

403
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,700
and letting it fall into the wrong hands?

404
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,800
I thought that my feelings for you were deep and loving.

405
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,900
Who knew that it would become like this?

406
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,600
If I knew earlier that you would suspect me

407
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,200
I would have willingly stayed at Liuyun Feng and be alone the rest of my life.

408
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Huanhuan, if we test it

409
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,700
I can return you and the children's innocence.

410
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,900
You want to do the test, which means that you don't trust me.

411
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,000
Since you

412
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,900
You suspect that Dr. Wen and I are involved

413
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,500
Then Hongye

414
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,900
can just do the blood recognition test with doctor Wen.

415
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,700
This way it won't harm your precious body.

416
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,900
And it can give me and Hongye our innocence.

417
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Subi Sheng, go bring sixth prince here.

418
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,200
Yes.

419
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,600
Go prepare the materials for the blood recognition test.

420
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,600
Yes.

421
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,300
Sixth prince Hongye greets the Emperor.

422
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,300
Emperor, sixth prince...

423
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,400
Bleed a drop

424
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,800
Emperor, if you do this

425
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,700
even if you prove he is your biological son

426
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,100
He'd be despised later on in his life.

427
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,800
Because his father has doubted of his authenticity.

428
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,500
In the future... How does Hong Yan keep a foothold?

429
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,500
Sit down.

430
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,400
Subi Sheng

431
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,700
Yes.

432
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,400
Wenshi Chu.

433
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,600
Emperor, this isn't possible!

434
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,100
This is absolutely impossible!

435
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,300
How dare you not kneel down?

436
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,700
I'm innocent. Why should I kneel?

437
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,400
The blood came together, signaling the relationship.

438
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,600
What else can you say?

439
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,300
Come! Take off her Noble Consort items.

440
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,600
Throw her into the cold palace!

441
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,400
And take the bastard with her.

442
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,000
Wenshi Chu will be executed immediately!

443
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,300
Who dares to?

444
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,200
I treated you well.

445
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,200
Why? Why do you have to do this to me?

446
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,200
Emperor!

447
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,500
You've disappointed me too much.

448
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,900
You look yourself!

449
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,800
This water, there's something wrong with this water.

450
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,300
Emperor, there's something wrong with this water.

451
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,300
Emperor, there's something wrong with this water!

452
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,600
Anyone's blood can mix together!

453
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,100
Emperor, come look!

454
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,400
Emperor!

455
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,800
There's something wrong with this water.

456
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,600
Emperor, there's something wrong with this water!

457
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,200
Someone did something to it.

458
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,700
I'm innocent, Emperor!

459
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,700
Emperor.

460
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,400
This is impossible.

461
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,900
I cannot have the ability to reproduce.

462
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,500
How can doctor Wen and Jingxin be my children?

463
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,100
I know.

464
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,600
Emperor, the water has some acidic properties.

465
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,400
It's the result of adding alum.

466
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,300
Emperor, old medical records

467
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,000
say that if alum gets into water

468
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,700
then even if they aren't related the blood can mix.

469
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,400
If alum is added to water,

470
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,600
even if they may be father and son

471
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,700
the blood couldn't possibly mix, Emperor.

472
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,800
Emperor, the evil of someone's heart can be clearly seen.

473
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,000
Just now in order to be fair

474
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,500
The empress prepared this water herself.

475
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,100
There's nothing wrong with the water I prepared.

476
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,600
I remember that you have knowledge in medicine.

477
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,700
Even if I had such intentions

478
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,700
It's too easy to figure out.

479
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,600
It's too risky!

480
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,500
I'm not that foolish.

481
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,900
Emperor, the proverb says it well

482
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,900
"Nothing ventured, nothing gained."

483
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,900
Although the risk is big, the chances of winning are also big.

484
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,000
Once this succeeds, everyone would think that sixth prince was doctor Wen's.

485
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:16,163
Who else would test it?

486
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,800
Emperor, I'm innocent.

487
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,400
Please investigate thoroughly.

488
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,500
I am the Empress,

489
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,700
why would I resort to such tactics to frame noble Consort Xi?

490
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Yes, you are already Empress.

491
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,700
What else would you be unsatisfied with?

492
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,800
Please look into this, Emperor.

493
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,700
Emperor, I was able to discover just in time

494
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,400
Even if Hong Yan is truly yours...

495
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,300
He'd still be pinned to death.

496
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,200
I have respected you as Empress.

497
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,000
And have shown you the utmost respect.

498
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,900
I don't know what I did to offend you

499
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,800
to want me to suffer such a terrible punishment.

500
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,300
Emperor, I've prepared a clean bowl of water.

501
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,600
There's definitely nothing wrong with this water.

502
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,500
Do the test again.

503
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,600
Yes.

504
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,600
Emperor, take a look.

505
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,000
The emperor has tested it. You aren't suspicious anymore are you?

506
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Zhen huan, I was wrong to blame you.

507
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,700
I don't suspect you anymore.

508
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,700
I have finally been cleared of accusations.

509
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Sit.

510
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,100
Precious Qi.

511
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,800
At this point, do you have anything left to say?

512
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,500
Even if sixth prince is your biological son

513
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,200
Noble Consort Xi and Wenshi Chu's affair

514
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,500
is witnessed by three people.

515
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,600
Are you just going to ignore it?

516
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,000
I am not lying.

517
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,100
Even if you don't believe my words

518
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
then you can't not believe priestess Bai's words.

519
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,000
She personally saw at Ganlu Temple

520
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,600
the Doctor Wen frequently visited Noble Consort Xi.

521
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Ahmetuofuo, those who devote themselves to monkhood don't like.

522
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,100
Priestess Jingbai's words

523
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,000
would be enough for all the nuns and monks to die out of shame.

524
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,500
Sister, you didn't return to the palace after it's so late

525
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,100
I was so worried about you.

526
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,200
Sister, are you alright?

527
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,500
I'm fine.

528
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,600
I just wanted to go back to rest.

529
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,900
Who knew that on the way back

530
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,000
I saw second miss with a girl and gonggong

531
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,700
who were looking for Noble Consort Xi.

532
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,200
The gonggong she brought was Xiao Yunzi

533
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,300
Xiao Yunzi said

534
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,400
he knew someone from Ganlu Temple

535
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,200
and so I thought that

536
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,800
if priestess Jingbai's words aren't reliable

537
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,300
then another person would be better.

538
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,200
So I gave my pass to Xiao Yunzi

539
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,700
to ask him to find the person.

540
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,100
Who knew that second miss

541
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,000
and Xiao Yunzi

542
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,300
were pretty fast

543
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,900
and hurried back.

544
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,800
Emperor, you annulled my sister once.

545
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,900
Do you want to do it a second time?

546
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,500
Priestess Jingbai isn't the only nun at Ganlu Temple.

547
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,200
Emperor you should listen to someone else.

548
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,100
After a year

549
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,800
Niangniang's frostbitten hands

550
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,600
do they still get bad in the winter?

551
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,300
It's much better.

552
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,200
Except in the wintertime the pain cannot be avoided.

553
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,300
What?

554
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,300
You know about Noble Consort Xi's frostbitten hands?

555
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,100
When Noble Consort Xi was at Ganlu Temple she would have to chop firewood, wash clothes

556
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,500
and other hard work.

557
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,300
In the cold wintertime she would have to put her hands in the cold river.

558
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,391
How can she not get frostbite?

559
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,800
If she wouldn't do it, Jingbai would beat and curse at her.

560
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,600
Noble Consort would often be sick and in pain.

561
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,200
Once when it was snowing

562
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:23,147
she was framed by Jingbai for stealing bird nest (delicacy)

563
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,700
and shooed to Lingyun Feng.

564
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,900
She almost died a few times.

565
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,900
Emperor, if doctor Wen didn't frequently visit her

566
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Noble Consort may not survive to be here today.

567
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,100
She is a nun, yet is so cruel.

568
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,700
You didn't die in Jingbai's hands

569
00:32:40,004 --> 00:32:41,651
She isn't that vicious afterall.

570
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,600
The place Lingyun Feng is difficult to reach

571
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:46,621
and wild cats often hurt people.

572
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,700
If Noble Consort Xi and doctor Wen really had an affair

573
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,300
they could have easily left.

574
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,300
Why would they stay there and suffer?

575
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,100
Huanhuan, you have suffered.

576
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,100
Jiejie suffered through so much

577
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Your majesty you should severely punish the nun.

578
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,500
I did not treat Niangniang badly, please think about it.

579
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,600
How do you think we should handle it?

580
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:20,425
I think that this nun has too cruel of a heart.

581
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,500
And she likes to lie.

582
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,200
Your Majesty you should pull out her tongue

583
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,200
to avenge jiejie.

584
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,700
We thought that Imperial Concubine An Pin was tender and gracious.

585
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,500
Who knew that there would be times when you can be cold-hearted.

586
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,100
Precious Qi, save me Precious Qi!

587
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,700
Precious Qi, save me!

588
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,400
Emperor, have mercy on me!

589
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,500
Emperor!

590
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,400
Jingbai said that it's been two years since she entered the harem.

591
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,300
Yet she knows a lot about what is going on in the harem.

592
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,900
It's been difficult for Precious Qi.

593
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
I'll have you all arrested, one by one!

594
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,500
Mistress, Mistress, I'm sorry.

595
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,200
Mistress.

596
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I'm sorry.

597
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,400
But I don't dare to not come to the palace.

598
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,800
Or else Precious Qi

599
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,600
will have Chensi beat me to death!

600
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,900
Mistress.

601
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,600
Emperor

602
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,100
Although my mistress knew doctor Wen for a longer time

603
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,500
they never had any affairs.

604
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,200
Please look into this, Emperor.

605
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,900
Emperor... It was Precious Qi who instigated

606
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,200
Bin Er, Fei Wen and Jing Bai to slander me.

607
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,700
This was only made known now.

608
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,300
I wonder... who else could be instructing Precious Qi.

609
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,400
Otherwise she wouldn't be so brave.

610
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,900
And she wouldn't be able to think of this plan.

611
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,900
Concubine Xi is right.

612
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,200
If the person behind this is still in the palace causing trouble

613
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,400
I'm afraid in the future

614
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,400
there won't be peace.

615
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,100
Emperor, please get to the bottom of this.

616
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,900
Qi Guiren, if you tell us who made you do this

617
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,600
I may be able to forgive you.

618
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,700
It's up to you whether you want to live.

619
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,300
Nobody made me do it.

620
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,800
Xi Guifei, I'm out to get you.

621
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,700
Really?

622
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,400
Since the day the Gua Er Family rose to power,

623
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,600
your father has been jealous of my father, and you hated me.

624
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,600
This has nothing to do with my family!

625
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,400
My family background, my looks... which of them aren't on par with yours?

626
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,600
But why is it only you who gets all of the Emperor's attention?

627
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,500
It was all my idea.

628
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,700
How nice it is to have a biological sister by your side in the palace...

629
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,200
When I saw

630
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Concubine Xi with her blood sister...

631
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,100
It reminded me of the old times,

632
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,900
with Elder Sister in the palace

633
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,300
when we served the Emperor, you.

634
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,900
With blood sister by your side,

635
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,500
regardless of blessings or misfortunes,

636
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,800
there'd at least be someone who trusts my ownself.

637
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,900
Emperor, if my sister were here,

638
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,700
she would trust that I'm innocent.

639
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,400
I really wish

640
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,700
your sister didn't have a sister like you.

641
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,204
I want to know about the water.

642
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,000
Emperor, I didn't do it on purpose.

643
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,500
When Empress went to get the water, I helped her a bit.

644
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,300
I have forgotten that I had handled alum,

645
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,200
and my hands touched the water incidentally.

646
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,600
It was a mistake and no ulterior motives, my Emperor.

647
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,100
Hui Chun have been careless with her duties...

648
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:35,232
Dismiss her to the Punishment Division.

649
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,400
Empress, save me!

650
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:40,256
Empress! Empress!

651
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,800
Get up.

652
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,200
There has been no news from Jing Ren Palace.

653
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,100
Dr. Wen still hasn't come back.

654
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,200
Cai yue, go find out what's going on.

655
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,400
See what is going on.

656
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,500
Niangniang, bad news.

657
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,900
Jingren palace is in a mes

658
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,700
and it seems like Noble Consort Xi suffered a lot.

659
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,600
An Pin niangniang wanted me to tell you.

660
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,400
What did you say? Noble Consort Xi suffered a lot?

661
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
What did she suffer?

662
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,100
It was all because of Precious Qi

663
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,700
who said that sixth prince was doctor Wen's child.

664
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,100
Mistress!

665
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,900
Mistress!

666
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,000
Prepare the sedan, get ready to go to Jingren Palace.

667
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,500
You cannot go.

668
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,400
If Bao Que was right,

669
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,200
you'd be risking a miscarriage if you were to go.

670
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
How can you say that at a time like this?

671
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,300
I will be careful okay?

672
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,300
If the Emperor listens to those despicable people

673
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,500
he believes that Zhen Huan and Dr. Wen are having an affair

674
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,700
Then I'd really have a miscarriage!

675
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,100
Go quickly!

676
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,200
Hurry.

677
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,800
Precious Qi... of the Gua Er Jia Family is guilty of fear mongering,

678
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,500
stirred troubles and disrupted the harmony within Palace.

679
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,600
Dismiss her to the Cold Palace.

680
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,600
Kang Chanzai, Zhen pin,

681
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,900
For spreading rumors, you lose your salaries for six months.

682
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,100
I'll let Concubine Xi handle the rest.

683
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,000
Jingxin

684
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:26,493
you take BianEr and Moyan back.

685
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,900
Yes.

686
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,200
Feiwen, Jingbai

687
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,000
Beat them to their deaths.

688
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,700
Xi Guifei, spare me! Emperor, spare me!

689
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,700
Xi Guifei, spare me! Emperor, spare me!

690
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,600
Since I've returned to the palace,

691
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,800
there are too many rumors about me and my babies

692
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,800
Before I didn't do anything

693
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,900
because I thought they would fade.

694
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,900
Who knew that my tolerance caused today's unfortunate event.
