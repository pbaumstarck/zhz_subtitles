1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Episode 64

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,400
Niang niang, we've cut off Jing Bai's tongue.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,000
Reward it to the person of Gua Er household.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,700
Here

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,300
One more tongue

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,100
That'll teach her how to use her tongue.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,100
Your heart is very poisoned

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,700
I have to thank An Pin for this idea.

9
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:24,416
Wen Shichu!

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,356
Even though you didn't have an affair,

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,600
can you say that you've never had secret feelings for her?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,300
Do you have the guts to swear upon your family, your parents?

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,400
That to the Emperor's women that you've never had any romantic feelings for?

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,300
Mistress,

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,700
You're delirious.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,300
Delirious?

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,900
Do you think the Emperor and I don't have eyes?

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,400
Official Wen.

19
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:52,630
I've heard that you still aren't married.

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,000
Whether I am married or not,

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,300
This doesn't concern you.

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,800
Emperor Emperor

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,500
My feelings to you are true.

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,400
Emperor

25
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,000
I've served you for many years

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,400
Why can you only think about the slut who offends you?

27
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,600
Emperor

28
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,600
Emperor Emperor

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Take her away

30
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,500
Emperor Emperor!

31
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,200
Emperor Emperor!

32
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,100
Wen Shi Chu, as long as you are with her

33
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,800
You will be the death of her.

34
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,300
I will open my eyes and wait until that day

35
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,100
Emperor

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,900
Sir, you should know

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,400
You, your feelings

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,100
will cause people to die.

39
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,900
Emperor, Niangniang,

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,000
I will prove myself.

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,400
Take this dirty thing away.

42
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,200
It's been a chaotic day.

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,900
I'm tired

44
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,100
The queen is tired too.

45
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,100
Your health has always had problems

46
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,300
In the future if there's any problem in the palace

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,200
let Xi Guifei handle it.

48
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,700
Emperor

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,042
with help from Duan Fei and Jing Fei

50
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,000
You can recover your health in peace

51
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,700
With the two of you handling things

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,000
I am really relieved.

53
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,900
Thank you Emperor

54
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,800
Your Majesty,

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,800
Dr. Wen...Dr Wen,

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,900
Say it clearly

57
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,700
Dr Wen castrated himself

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
His life is in danger.

59
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,800
Mistress! Mistress!

60
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,400
Doctor! Doctor!

61
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,400
Quickly, hang in there!

62
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,400
Quickly take this medicine!

63
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,700
Mistress, push hard!

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
Mistress

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,900
Mistress, quickly!

66
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,700
Mistress, push hard!

67
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,600
Mistress, Mistress!

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
Quickly! With force!

69
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,500
Harder!

70
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,800
Mistress, push hard!

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
Hang in there!

72
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,200
Quickly go and take the medication that stops the bleeding.

73
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,100
His life will be saved after he takes the medication that stops the bleeding,

74
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,800
Go quickly!

75
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,000
Mistress, push hard!

76
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,100
Hard! Yes, yes, yes!

77
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,500
Almost there!

78
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,000
Just a little more!

79
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,800
Mistress, hang in there!

80
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,700
Push hard, mistress!

81
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,700
Push hard!

82
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,400
Why is she bleeding so much?

83
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,500
Bring hot water!

84
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,100
Quickly! Quickly!

85
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Mistress

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,200
The water is here!

87
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,800
Move over.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,400
Hang in there, mistress!

89
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,100
What do we do?

90
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,500
You knew Mei Zhuang was pregnant.

91
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,600
She can't handle shock right now.

92
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,600
Yet your servant ran to Sui Yu Xian to tell her.

93
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,400
Lingrong.

94
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,400
What motives do you have?

95
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,900
Jie Jie I don't know about this issue

96
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,800
Jiejie don't blame me.

97
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,500
I really don't know about this issue

98
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,100
Jie Jie you have to believe me

99
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,700
Bao juan didn't mean for this to happen!

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,500
If I knew it would be like this

101
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,864
I would rather suffer in Mei jiejie's place

102
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,100
Jiejie,

103
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,900
We entered the palace together, I

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,800
I don't care if you planned this

105
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
All I care about is that they save her.

106
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,500
If there's the slightest problem

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,700
I won't ever let you go.

108
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,700
I deserved to be slapped.

109
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,200
I was unable to control my servants

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,500
and that led to today's disaster.

111
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,400
Bao Juan, come here!

112
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,200
Greetings, Niang niang.

113
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
You still dare to greet me like this?

114
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,400
Niang niang, I know I'm guilty.

115
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,300
You've put Hui Pin in shock!

116
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,500
You want me to feel bad, don't you?

117
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,100
Mistress, take care of your body.

118
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,500
Niang niang, forgive me.

119
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,100
I've been friends with Mei Jiejie this many years

120
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,000
And you had to startle Mei Jiejie's pregnancy.

121
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,900
If anything happens to Jiejie

122
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,100
I will go with her.

123
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,100
What's the point of living?

124
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Who told you to speak out of turn?

125
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,600
-You stupid servant! This is for speaking out of turn! <br> -I won't do it again. Niangniang, I know I was wrong.

126
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:56,485
If the servant doesn't know things, An Pin don't break the rules.

127
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,300
Greetings Emperor.

128
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,100
If the servant disobeys the rules

129
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,500
Go to a quiet place and just beat her to death

130
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,000
Su Bi Sheng.

131
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,500
Come.

132
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,800
Emperor, spare me!

133
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,900
I know I was wrong

134
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,400
I won't dare to do it again

135
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,100
Emperor, spare me! I won't dare to do it again!

136
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,100
I won't dare to do it again!

137
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,700
Emperor, spare me!

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I won't dare to do it again!

139
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,700
Emperor, spare me!

140
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,900
Us your strength mistress!

141
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,200
Mistress!

142
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,400
Push!

143
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,300
You're almost there mistress!

144
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,000
Your Majesty,

145
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,700
We have stopped Dr Wen's bleeding

146
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,200
There is no danger to his life

147
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,500
However...

148
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,900
Speak.

149
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,500
He's the same as the eunuchs now.

150
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,700
He can't have children anymore.

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,200
I understand.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,700
How come there is no news about Imperial Concubine Hui?

153
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,300
Don't be anxious, Emperor

154
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,500
Your Majesty,

155
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,400
Hui Pin was shocked.

156
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,500
and her pregnancy became unstable.

157
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:07,196
The situation is very bad.

158
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,400
My healing skills are shallow

159
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,500
and before, it was Dr. Wen who took care of her.

160
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,600
I don't know anything about how her situation was before.

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,300
I really cannot do much right now.

162
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,100
What about the child?

163
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,400
Niangniang has lost a lot of blood

164
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,000
so she doesn't have the strength to push.

165
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,000
The baby's head won't come out

166
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,100
I've already given Niang Niang guchong soup to drink

167
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,800
and has not seen a good turn

168
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,000
I really don't know

169
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,300
Niangniang's health.

170
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,600
I am afraid to use a medicine to stop the bleeding.

171
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,400
If Dr. Wen were here,

172
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,900
Dr. Wen is already stable

173
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,500
But in his current condition

174
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I'm afraid he can't deliver Hui Pin's baby

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
It's ok if Dr Wen can't walk

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,500
He can be carried on a stretcher

177
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,400
Although Dr. Wen cannot help with the delivery

178
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,100
he knows of her situation.

179
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,600
He can help me prepare the medicine.

180
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Dr. Wen suffered for a crime he was not guilty of.

181
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,000
If it causes something to happen to Mei jiejie or the baby

182
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,600
that would be terrible.

183
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,000
Hurry and carry Wen Shichu over here.

184
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,400
Yes.

185
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,900
Teacher, teacher.

186
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,500
Gu Lin, Gu Lin

187
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Hui Pin has always been gentle and kind.

188
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,900
She

189
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,200
is suffering difficulties because of circulation problems.

190
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,500
Hurry

191
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,200
Hurry and use wild ginseng to keep her conscious.

192
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,600
Then have her drink the Shengju soup.

193
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,700
I understand. Hurry and prepare it!

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,400
Bring the medicine!

195
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,000
Teacher.

196
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,900
This is to speed up the labor process.

197
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,700
What did you say we should add?

198
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,600
Add seven salted plums. <br> Salted plums.

199
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,600
Burn them to ashes. <br> Burn them to ashes.

200
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,700
Then add one ounce of aged cassia flower. <br> Then add aged cassia flower.

201
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,500
Half an ounce of herbs. <br> Herbs.

202
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
At the end,

203
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,000
Red agate. <br> Ok.

204
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,500
Give the special beverage to Niang Niang as well. Hurry.

205
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,600
Got it! Go prepare it!

206
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,100
Emperor, Hui Pin has taken Dr. Wen's medicine

207
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,300
She is bleeding a bit less

208
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,300
Now she can use her strength.

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,800
Emperor please don't worry. Jiejie will be fine.

210
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,700
Go tell Imperial Concubine Hui

211
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,200
that with my edict

212
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,800
Hui Pin is promoted to Hui Fei

213
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,300
and relax while she delivers the baby.

214
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,900
Yes.

215
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,900
I owe MeiEr too much.

216
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,700
Wait for her to give birth

217
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,700
and then I'll make it up to her

218
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,700
Congratulations Emperor! Hui Pin gave birth to a princess!

219
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,100
Good, this is wonderful!

220
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
How is Hui Fei?

221
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,200
She's very tired, she can't even speak.

222
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I'll go see her.

223
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,400
She just gave birth and is extremely tired.

224
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Let's let mistress rest for a while.

225
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,800
Your Majesty must be exhausted, hurry and get some rest.

226
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,900
Come back and visit her when she's feeling better

227
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,500
I'll stay here and look after her

228
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,800
No need to worry

229
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,100
Alright.

230
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,500
But you should rest also.

231
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,152
Don't tire yourself out.

232
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,700
I'll escort you out.

233
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,300
Farewell, Emperor.

234
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,500
Great!

235
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,300
Now Niangniang can relax.

236
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,800
Have some tea.

237
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,800
Bad news!

238
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,100
Mistress has died from vaginal bleeding!

239
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
How is it?

240
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,000
Hurry and grab the coagulant.

241
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,500
No need.

242
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,100
Who says no need? Who said that?

243
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,200
Bring the best medicine!

244
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,900
If you don't save her, I'll kill you and have you buried with her.

245
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,300
Yes.

246
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,500
Huan Er

247
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,400
Jiejie

248
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,900
Don't cry.

249
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,000
I want to talk to you

250
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,900
Tell them all to go outside.

251
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Go outside.

252
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,400
Wen Shichu, you stay.

253
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,000
My child

254
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,900
still this small

255
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,400
This soft.

256
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,900
yes

257
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,100
but she'll grow up quickly

258
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,500
Look how fast Hong Ye and Ling Xi grew.

259
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,900
Jiejie, the Emperor hopes that you're well

260
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,800
He already promoted you to Hui Fei

261
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,300
Are you happy as Noble Consort Xi?

262
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,900
You are the Xi Guifei that he will always love

263
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,900
but you don't like your title.

264
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,100
What do I care about being a Consort?

265
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,800
I know you don't care about being promoted

266
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,900
But your child depends on your title.

267
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,900
You have to prepare for the baby's future

268
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,700
She won't care about these things

269
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,400
Shichu, have you held the baby?

270
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,500
Hold her

271
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,600
I...

272
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,800
I don't dare

273
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,200
Do you still blame me?

274
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,200
I'm also at fault for that night

275
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,300
Don't blame yourself.

276
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,000
Today you castrated yourself

277
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,300
isn't that because your guilty conscience was too strong?

278
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,600
I know

279
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,000
I know you hate me

280
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,000
You hate that day

281
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,600
with the wine the Empress Dowager rewarded me and the Emperor

282
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,600
I coaxed you into drinking it.

283
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,500
And made it your life-long regret.

284
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,900
Jiejie, you're confused

285
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,300
I'm about to die

286
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
what do I have to fear?

287
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,800
Being confused gave me happiness.

288
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,400
I have no regrets.

289
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,100
Huan Er,

290
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,900
All these years I've only had you and Shichu

291
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,300
who have been kind to me

292
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,600
but it's you in his heart

293
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,700
so he has been good to me

294
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,900
because of you

295
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,000
Jiejie

296
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,900
Shichu

297
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,700
I want to ask you one thing

298
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,000
These years

299
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
have you ever truly liked me?

300
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,300
Even a little?

301
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,300
Never mind.

302
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,400
I rather you don't say it

303
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,300
than to

304
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,900
have you pity me because I'm about to die

305
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,600
and lie to me.

306
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,500
That day's wine wasn't enough for me to have feelings for you.

307
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,900
So

308
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,700
I'm good to you

309
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,100
I wasn't good to you just because of Zhen Huan

310
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,400
Really?

311
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,400
Hearing you say this

312
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,300
I

313
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,500
I'm so happy

314
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,000
To know you in this lifetime

315
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,400
I'm not regretful

316
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,400
Shichu

317
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:14,200
Hold our child

318
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,200
Ok?

319
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,800
Yes

320
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,500
Huan Er

321
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,500
The baby doesn't have a name yet

322
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,800
Jing He

323
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,500
Call her Jing He, ok?

324
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,100
Gentle and easy-going, a quiet and peaceful life.

325
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,200
Isn't that what we've always wanted?

326
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,900
Don't cry...Don't cry

327
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,900
Although I am now a cripple

328
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,200
But we,

329
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,100
we can be together forever

330
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,300
No one will ever do what they did to Noble Consort Xi

331
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,700
to us anymore.

332
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,200
Shichu,

333
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,600
Raise our child well

334
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,900
don't let people bully her

335
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,500
Huan Er

336
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,100
Help Shichu take care of the baby

337
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,300
Also the Empress and Ling Rong

338
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,200
you have to

339
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,400
be careful of them

340
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm so tired

341
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,600
It's so nice.

342
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,700
I

343
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:46,200
I have never been like this

344
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:54,800
being embraced by you.

345
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,200
Go serve jiejie

346
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,900
What's up?

347
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,800
Don't speak

348
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,900
Ok

349
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,800
I'm done fixing it

350
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,500
Even though it's not good

351
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,900
it's still much better than before

352
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,900
It's very nice. It's like a lively centipede.

353
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
No other girl has sewn clothes for me before.

354
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,300
just my mother

355
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,000
My mother is Xi Tai Pin.

356
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,600
She used to embroider.

357
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,400
She takes good care of you

358
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,200
She must care for you a lot.

359
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,900
Princess drink your medicine.

360
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,400
Here.

361
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,900
Here.

362
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,700
The Princess won't take her medicine

363
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,500
How will she get better?

364
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,400
Even the tone of her cries are low.

365
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,700
The princess is too young, she won't be able to drink the medicine.

366
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,400
Even if she drinks it she will spit it out.

367
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,300
Then have the nurse drink it and liquefy it.

368
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:00,872
Feed it to the princess.

369
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,500
This idea will work.

370
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,900
Niangniang, Consort Hui passed away

371
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,600
no matter how much Niangniang is grieving, you must watch your own body.

372
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,300
These past two days I keep dreaming.

373
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,400
I dream about the times before I entered the palace

374
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,400
when I was with Mei jiejie

375
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,700
I always think she's still here

376
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,800
Niangniang is thinking too much.

377
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,500
You've lost weight.

378
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,700
It's good that the Emperor cared for Consort Hui

379
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,200
All the funeral customs will be of the Noble Consort status

380
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,700
and he let you care for princess Jing He.

381
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,300
How is your teacher?

382
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,000
He is a cripple now

383
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,300
and his mental strength has collapsed.

384
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,700
All he does is drink.

385
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,500
He never knew his feelings until she left.

386
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,500
What's the point in it?

387
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:05,022
Take care of him for me

388
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,700
Yes Niangniang.

389
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,500
With Wen Shichu's situation

390
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,900
A doctor that I can rely on

391
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,900
there's only you.

392
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,200
Thank you for trust.

393
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
I will do my best.

394
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,200
Having such thoughts is good.

395
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,100
I won't mistreat you.

396
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,100
In a couple days invite Wen Shichu

397
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
to take Jing He princess's pulse.

398
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,500
You know the importance.

399
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,900
I understand.

400
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,200
Niangniang, if you don't have anything else

401
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:41,648
I will leave.

402
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,700
Go.

403
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,500
Thank you.

404
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,300
Greetings

405
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,500
Please rise

406
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,600
Niangniang, the Emperor has a gift

407
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,500
is the second miss here?

408
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,700
She went to Empress Dowager's palace.

409
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,700
Then please accept it in place of second miss.

410
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,200
The gift from the Emperor is the palace's newly created

411
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,300
bingdi begonia hairpiece

412
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,600
to commend Second Lady for bravely barging into the Empress's palace

413
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,800
to save the Noble Consort's courage.

414
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,300
Thank the Emperor for me

415
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,600
I'll depart then

416
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,500
Has Bao Que's funeral been settled?

417
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,600
Yes.

418
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,300
Except, mistress, at this time

419
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,300
why are you only worrying about Bao Que?

420
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,800
Then what should I worry about?

421
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,100
The Emperor hasn't been here

422
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,500
to visit us in several days

423
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,400
You're not making a plan or worrying

424
00:29:07,728 --> 00:29:09,446
What is there to worry about?

425
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,400
It's not just here that he's not going to

426
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,900
He's feeling down because of Hui Fei

427
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,400
But don't worry

428
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,600
He'll be better in a few days

429
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,100
Don't I know the Emperor?

430
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,100
Mistress, forgive my blunt words

431
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,200
but even if Consort Hui didn't die

432
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,300
she wouldn't be in our way.

433
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,000
It doesn't mater if Consort Hui died.

434
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,700
Except, her relationship with Zhen Huan is so strong

435
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,100
that with her death

436
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,700
Zhen Huan will become extremely depressed.

437
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,100
Only seeing Zhen Huan grieving

438
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,100
will make me comfortable.

439
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,600
Consort Hui jiejie,

440
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,300
I drink this cup to you.

441
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,500
When you arrive in front of the god of the underworld,

442
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,400
Zhen Huan caused your death

443
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,400
I don't remember rewarding you

444
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,700
Cui Bai's painting.

445
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,800
My younger sister's graffiti work

446
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,800
has fooled the Emperor as well?

447
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,300
The girl who stormed into the Empress's palace?

448
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,700
I rewarded her with jewelry and she hasn't thanked me yet.

449
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Today she's at your palace, she can't delay it anymore.

450
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,600
Greetings, Emperor.

451
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,200
Do you not like the hairpiece I gave you?

452
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,400
You're not wearing it

453
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,200
She usually doesn't like these accessories

454
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,900
so she doesn't wear it.

455
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,600
You didn't thank the Emperor for his gift yet.

456
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,400
I not only dislike golden accessories,

457
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,400
but also those begonia flowers on the hairpiece are my sister's favorite.

458
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,400
Jiejie loves it, so I won't take any part of it.

459
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,600
Ok then

460
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,700
You like to paint,

461
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,700
would you like to paint with the artists from the palace?

462
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,200
I can arrange that for you.

463
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,100
The painters of the palace mostly like rich, gaudy colors.

464
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,700
You've seen my copy of Cui Bai's painting,

465
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,400
so you must know that the palace painters and I won't be compatible.

466
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,500
You paint geese very well.

467
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,600
I like birds of loyalty.

468
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
When you have time, go to Ru Yi Guan

469
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,500
and get Cui Bai's real sketch.

470
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,600
This painting is well-liked by both Yunli and Yunxi,

471
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,700
He's asked for it many times

472
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,700
and now I give it to you.

473
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,700
Thank you your Majesty.

474
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,700
This painting is a good omen.

475
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,300
I also hope that when my sister gets married

476
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,300
that she won't be too far from me.

477
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,100
Like the painting's

478
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,300
goose and flowers.

479
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,300
If sisters separate then it's boring.

480
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,700
What a coincidence.

481
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,300
What coincidence? I think that it's more like "the road between enemies is narrow".

482
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,600
If we aren't enemies we wouldn't meet.

483
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,000
My brother has given the painting to you?

484
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,900
It was to make Jiejie happy.

485
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,100
I asked my brother for this so many times

486
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,100
and he didn't want to give it.

487
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,000
It seems like he has Noble Consort in his heart.

488
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,300
What? You like this painting too?

489
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,100
Aside from everything,

490
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,700
The pair of geese is the best.

491
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,600
The vast, mile-long layers of cloud.

492
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,700
A thousand mountains and twilight clouds, to whom does the shadow go?

493
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,100
You also like the words?

494
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,700
Yuan Haowen's good poetry is only this one.

495
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,000
Geese are birds of loyalty.

496
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,700
So I like it.

497
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,200
Right, thank you for helping jiejie that other night.

498
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,300
No need, it's something I should do.

499
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,900
But this thanks is very late.

500
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,000
If you really want to thank me

501
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,900
then let me admire this painting.

502
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Okay.

503
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,300
Cui Bai's style

504
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,900
has changed Northern Song dynasty's superficial extravagant art style.

505
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,200
He pursued realism

506
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,800
and was able to convey all the expressions.

507
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,400
So it's not like you don't learn art.

508
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,400
I don't learn art?

509
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,800
How about we have an art competition?

510
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,400
Alright. What do we draw?

511
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,900
Draw, a spring scene.

512
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,100
Okay.

513
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,300
We'll go to Ru Ye Guan to paint.

514
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,000
Yes.

515
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,900
I heard that the Emperor is ignoring Imperial Concubine An and the others.

516
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,800
But the Empress is getting it easy.

517
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,800
The Emperor let her off so easily.

518
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,400
He really doesn't distinguish good from bad.

519
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,400
The Emperor is not being unfair here.

520
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
He is remembering his past relationship with Empress Chunyuan.

521
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,700
Besides, the Empress Dowager is protecting her.

522
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,400
He can't do as he pleases.

523
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,600
Wen Shichu greets Noble Consort Xi.

524
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,200
I can smell the alcohol from a mile away.

525
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,700
Aren't you afraid of intoxicating Jinghe?

526
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,400
The one with a dead heart,

527
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,500
how can he care about his hygiene and appearance?

528
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,700
You carry her.

529
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,100
The child has become a bit heavier.

530
00:35:19,134 --> 00:35:20,977
The princess is healthy

531
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
all thanks to Niang Niang's careful nurture.

532
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,500
No matter how much I care for her,

533
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,900
I am still not her birth parents.

534
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,500
This child always cries loudly when nearing dusk.

535
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,100
Perhaps she misses Mei Jiejie.

536
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,600
That day when Mei Zhuang entered the casket,

537
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,900
I put the jade pot that has been passed down to me

538
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,800
into her casket.

539
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,400
Maybe I should've given it to her earlier.

540
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,500
I was too foolish.

541
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,500
And I made her regretful for so many years.

542
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,900
This lifetime

543
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,800
it was always me who was sorry towards her.

544
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,698
Though Jiejie has gone, Jinghe is still here.

545
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,300
You must at least take the child into account.

546
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Will you be drunken all day?

547
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,500
I will never forget in my lifetime

548
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,500
that feeling of her passing away in my arms.

549
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,900
Huan Meimei,

550
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,500
guarding you has already become a habit to me.

551
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,100
Habits are hard to change.

552
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,900
But toward Meizhuang,

553
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
her every loneliness and perseverance in this palace,

554
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,000
I can empathize.

555
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,400
She guarded me, just as for so many years

556
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,600
I guarded you in the same way.

557
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,000
I've already petitioned the Emperor

558
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,100
to guard her palace for three years as my punishment for not fulfilling my duty.

559
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,700
I understand Shichu Gege,

560
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,600
but the dead ones have already gone,

561
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,600
the live ones must continue living and take responsibility for everything.

562
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,900
You must live well

563
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,100
so that Jiejie can rest in peace.

564
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,300
Ever since Consort Hui died,

565
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,500
the Emperor has only gone to Yanxi Palace once.

566
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,600
And he only sat for a bit before leaving.

567
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,100
I already know all this.

568
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,900
Go touch Jingren Palace's walls and floor tiles,

569
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,500
they're cold like ice house.

570
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:32,000
After the Dragon Boat festival, the Emperor hasn't come here once.

571
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,700
You must be proactive in gaining your favors.

572
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Is it so hard

573
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,600
that I have to drag the Emperor to your palace?

574
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,700
Niang Niang don't worry.

575
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,500
As long as I live,

576
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,800
I will not let Noble Consort Xi live so easily.

577
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,600
Enough.

578
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,400
I promoted you because I had hope in you.

579
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,100
Don't let me down.

580
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,400
Niang Niang's expectations are my expectations.

581
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,500
The Emperor arrives.

582
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,300
Greetings to the Emperor.

583
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,400
Rise.

584
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,500
You usually can't tolerate heat.

585
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,000
I should be taking you to Yuanmingyuan to escape the heat.

586
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,100
Until one manages the household, one wouldn't know the hardships of rationing resources.

587
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,700
The Empress Dowager's body is not well enough for her to go on long trips.

588
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,000
If I take all my kids with me,

589
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,800
it wouldn't be easy either.

590
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,500
Nurses and nannies are so numerous.

591
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,700
Yuanmingyuan would have to be refurnished again.

592
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,600
That would cost oceans' worth of silvers.

593
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,500
How frugal of you.

594
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,500
I looked over the account book for this month's spending

595
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,000
and it was less by seven thousand than last month.

596
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,800
It's the fruit of your frugality.

597
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,000
Emperor shouldn't be happy so soon.

598
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,600
In the future,

599
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
when the Emperor takes in a few more consorts,

600
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,500
even ten thousand silvers wouldn't be enough to cover the cost.

601
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
I smell jealousy and sourness in your words.

602
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,800
If you want to save some money on that matter,

603
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,900
I will tell you a marvelous trick.

604
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,300
I will only marry some of your palace maids as Promises.

605
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,600
Their monthly allowances

606
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,700
will be deducted from yours.

607
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
You can marry whoever you like.

608
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,600
A few Promises is nothing uncommon.

609
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,700
If you really have a couple you like,

610
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,100
you might as well ordain them as Precious.

611
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,000
If you are really this generous,

612
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,700
then I shall marry Huanbi today!

613
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,500
What do you think?

614
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,200
She's my only dowry servant left.

615
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,900
Will you take her too?

616
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,300
Because she's one of your close people,

617
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,500
I will not treat her lightly.

618
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,100
Just like that year when I married you, how about I ordain her as a Lingering?

619
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,200
I'll ordain her as Lingering Xi (meaning happiness)
