00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Episode 65

2
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:04,960
I won't treat her poorly because she's your relative

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,959
How about Lingering?

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,040
Attendant Xi?

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,240
I dare not. I could never be good enough your majesty

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,240
Please don't

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,240
Should a normal maid have this honour

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,940
She'd be thanking the budda

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,640
whereas you would not

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,440
I confess my guilt.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,840
I am in love with someone

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,640
you are in love with someone

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,940
Is he a guard or a imperial physician? Tell me

14
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:39,147
You tell me

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,040
then...

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,340
and I'll consent to a marriage

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,140
Huan Bi I need to keep

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,740
and arrange her marriage myself some day

19
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,840
Huan Bi

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,340
Go bring Hong Yan from Prince Nursery.

21
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:53,639
Yes

22
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,540
I love watching you being jealous

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,340
After Consort Hui passed away, you have been upset.

24
00:01:08,362 --> 00:01:10,799
It's so hard to make you say more than a few words.

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,640
If it's just my grief, that would've been fine.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,840
But had Ruofeiguaerjia not been making troubles,

27
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,740
Mei Jiejie would have not died.

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,640
You don't have to worry about that.

29
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,673
I will give you an answer soon.

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,740
I hope so.

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,340
Or else Mei Jiejie wouldn't be able to rest in peace.

32
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,340
During this morning's court sesision,

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,940
Emin mentioned that I already have four sons

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,240
I can choose the eldest son as the crown prince to strengthen our nation's roots.

35
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,740
Those who say so should immediately be beaten.

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,740
Even killing them wouldn't be enough.

37
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,540
You are still at your peak, how can people talk about roots and such?

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,840
How ridiculous.

39
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:52,155
The earlier I appoint a crown prince,

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,240
the earlier he will be a target for everyone.

41
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,940
And it will result in all the princes not studying well.

42
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,540
All their thoughts will be occupied on the crown prince's seat.

43
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,840
Besides, our dynasty has always chosen the wisest as the crown prince, not necessarily the eldest.

44
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,540
Why would anyone waste their breath on the matter of seniority?

45
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,940
Right,

46
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,440
recently the Fourth Prince has been diligent in his studies.

47
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,689
Have you asked about his studies?

48
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,240
He's alright. He is fluent in what he has studied.

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,940
But,

50
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,740
I still feel our child is the best. Hongyan is the best.

51
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:28,800
In the end, the Empress really is an honest person.

52
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,140
How else would she have concocted such a plan

53
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,640
to add alum into the paternity-testing water and obscure your vision and hearing.

54
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,840
It's probably because you favor the younger ones.

55
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,840
Even now, I still fear for the future.

56
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,440
So I beg you to favor Hongyan a little less.

57
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,240
The Empress is anxious,

58
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,340
that I know.

59
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:51,034
Though Hongshi is not the best,

60
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:54,101
he is still my child. How can I not care for him?

61
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,540
I'll negotiate a marriage for Hongshi soon.

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,340
Then the Empress will be at peace.

63
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,840
I have been afraid to tell Empress Mother

64
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,540
that the Empress was also involved in the matter from last time.

65
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,340
She even secretly changed the paternity-testing water

66
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,040
and tried to implicate Noble Consort and the Sixth Prince.

67
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,240
You don't have to tell me.

68
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,240
These days,

69
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,140
you have been unwilling to step inside Jingren Palace.

70
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,640
I knew then.

71
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,140
Ever since the Noble Consort came back pregnant,

72
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:32,400
not just outsiders,

73
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,785
but even I was suspicious.

74
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:39,874
The imperial family's bloodline must remain pure.

75
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:41,877
No accidents can be allowed.

76
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,540
The Empress is in charge of the Six Palaces so she investigated this matter.

77
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,621
She's the only one fit for this duty.

78
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:50,850
Her method of dealing with this was questionable,

79
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,740
so she snuck in water mixed with alum,

80
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,640
almost wronging the Noble Consort.

81
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:59,803
As for you, you can blame her for her uselessness.

82
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,740
But you can't accuse her of deliberate implication.

83
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,340
Yes.

84
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,440
It's not because of anything else,

85
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,940
but because she is your most loved one's sister.

86
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,640
You can not believe Yixiu (the Empress),

87
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,740
but you can't not believe Chunyuan.

88
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,340
Yes.

89
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,040
The queen is the mother of the nation.

90
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,040
If the nation's mother is not at peace, then the civilians won't be either.

91
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,040
If an Emperor goes out without his Empress,

92
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,140
but with his favored consort,

93
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,440
then that consort will have a greedy heart.

94
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,940
If one day

95
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,940
the consorts rise above the Empress,

96
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,540
then the harem,

97
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,040
perhaps even the whole country,

98
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,340
will be in great chaos.

99
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,640
Yes.

100
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,740
A dying person,

101
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,640
his words are also just.

102
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,340
I'm almost done here.

103
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,740
Emperor, you should remember that

104
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,840
no matter how good Guifei is,

105
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:10,432
there is only one queen

106
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,640
Elder sister,

107
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,640
everyday we are in the gardens either looking at flowers or catching butterflies.

108
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,540
It's really boring!

109
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,040
The Forbidden City,

110
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,040
others only see the never-ending luxuries.

111
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:40,131
But only when they go in

112
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,706
and see the skies from four corners and the walls on the four sides

113
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,540
do they realize this is the most suffocating place.

114
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,940
Right?

115
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,340
What secrets are you sisters sharing?

116
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,540
Greetings to the Emperor.

117
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,340
Sister-in-law is here.

118
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,940
What a coincidence. <br> Thank you Emperor.

119
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,540
These two days,

120
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,440
the weather has been hot.

121
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:17,485
Have you gotten used to the palace?

122
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,140
If you have any discomfort, do tell your sister.

123
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,440
Treat here like your house.

124
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,540
Meimei has been in the palace for more than a few days.

125
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,340
Though the palace is different from our home,

126
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,140
she has adjusted well.

127
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,140
They've imported some good after-rain Longjing (a type of tea)

128
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,540
I'll give it to you later.

129
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,340
I don't know if your meimei will like it or not.

130
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,340
Thanks for the Emperor's care.

131
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,240
This palace is luxurious with many beauties. Naturally this is the best place.

132
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,640
But the only inconvenience is that there I have to obey rules everywhere.

133
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,540
It's not like at home where I can do whatever I want.

134
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,840
For example, in a civlian's home,

135
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,040
I would be calling you brother-in-law.

136
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,340
But in this palace, I have to constantly remember

137
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,160
that you are the all-powerful emperor.

138
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
So I have to always be cautious.

139
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,240
I can't treat the palace like my home.

140
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,340
Did you hear?

141
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,440
You got quite a sharp mouth.

142
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,000
But compared to your meimei,

143
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,980
you would have to bow down to her.

144
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,140
You are clearly saying that the palace isn't as comfortable as your home,

145
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,540
yet I can't feel angry.

146
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,240
I also fear Yurao's mouth the most.

147
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,140
I've always thought,

148
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,960
what kind of brother-in-law will be able to control Yurao's mouth?

149
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,680
Your meimei just got back from a faraway place,

150
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,680
and you, as a Jiejie,

151
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,640
are already so impatient as to marry her off?

152
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,930
According to my will,

153
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,340
sister-in-law is still young in age and can remain single for two more years.

154
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,840
Then we'll patiently choose a good one and talk about marriage then.

155
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,340
Doesn't sister-in-law feel suppressed in the palace?

156
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,740
I remember now.

157
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,800
Yunxi is here in the palace today.

158
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,740
He told me the weather is good

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,510
and that he's going to Yuanmingyuan to practice archery.

160
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,340
Does Noble Consort Xi want to accompany me to see the competition?

161
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,840
Sister-in-law should come too.

162
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,190
Who does he think he is? If his archery skill isn't good,

163
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,340
then I don't want to see it.

164
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,240
She's agreed to go.

165
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,040
Emperor's idea is good.

166
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,540
It's also rare for Prince Shen to enter the palace.

167
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Please allow us to change our clothes first

168
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,780
so that we can escort you.

169
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Alright.

170
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,040
Good!

171
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,150
Yunxi is growing up well.

172
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,040
Excelling in archery and horsemanship.

173
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,500
The seventeenth brother's archery and horsemanship

174
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,080
was taught personally by Emperor Father.

175
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,050
Yet he's forgotten it all now.

176
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,140
He's not as good as he was when he was seven or eight.

177
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,740
Imperial brother,

178
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,730
it's because I drink too often now,

179
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,910
so I've become unfamiliar to it now.

180
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,740
But on the contrary,

181
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,540
you have been diligent in archery and horsemanship.

182
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,540
The seventeeneth brother hasn't married yet.

183
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,140
If he marries,

184
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,170
wouldn't his hands and feet become even lazier?

185
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,660
If I had known this earlier, I wouldn't have drunk the wine.

186
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,840
Before the arrow is shot, I'm already drunk.

187
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,600
Pour it.

188
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,740
I'm worthy of death! <br> It's fine.

189
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,840
It's just a piece of clothing.

190
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,840
I'll change it at the side palace.

191
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,340
What is that?

192
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,240
Give it to me.

193
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,070
The seventeenth brother must have promised his feelings at some place.

194
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,640
Or else why would we find on his body

195
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,430
such things from women.

196
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,640
This paper art

197
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,750
seems to resemble Noble Consort Xi.

198
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,840
Perhaps some things,

199
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,440
I have experienced too much this year.

200
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,420
It's just a little image.

201
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,740
How can you be sure it's me?

202
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,440
This image does resemble Noble Consort Xi a bit,

203
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,140
but don't you think,

204
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,140
it also looks like Second Lady and Huanbi?

205
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,340
The lady in the image has lively eyes and brows,

206
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,800
The more I look at it, the more I think it's Second Lady.

207
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,240
It will be Qixi (Chinese Valentine's Day) in a month.

208
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,540
Perhaps Emperor should fulfill the lovers' wish.

209
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,380
But this is the first time Second Lady and Seventeenth Brother have ever met!

210
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:43,740
The edges of this paper art are frayed.

211
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,940
Old seventeen must have held it in his hand and looked at it for many times.

212
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,140
Sister-in-law entered the palace only months ago.

213
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
She's never seen Old Seventeen before this.

214
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,040
It can't be her.

215
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,170
Please grant death upon this servant!

216
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,510
This object is my image.

217
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Really?

218
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,840
Seven years ago,

219
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,980
I personally put it into the pouch.

220
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,840
At that time, Niang Niang was punished to kneel in front of Consort Hua's palace.

221
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,340
I met the Seventeenth Prince and asked him for help.

222
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,050
After, I went to Ninghui Palace to express my gratitude.

223
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,570
Really?

224
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,530
At that time, when I went to gave my thanks at Palace Ninghui,

225
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,480
I saw some pieces of colored paper on the Prince's desk.

226
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,540
On an impulse I cut out some window flower decorations

227
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,340
to give to the Prince as a present.

228
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,940
Then the Prince asked me if I knew how to cut out images.

229
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,450
So I cut out one according to my own likeness,

230
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,660
and put that little image into the pouch.

231
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,720
Then there was another time when I met with the Prince,

232
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,860
and the Prince asked me what kind of flower I like.

233
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,890
I said I like irises.

234
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
You can check in the pouch

235
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,100
to see if there are iris petals in there.

236
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,740
You are right.

237
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,840
If it's not your image,

238
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,940
how would you know,

239
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,440
what this pouch contains?

240
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,740
Huanhuan, did you know her feelings?

241
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,240
I am a fool.

242
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,540
She's deceived even me.

243
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,620
I remember that you always put a rhododendron in your hair.

244
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,840
What, the flower you like isn't rhododendron

245
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,640
but iris?

246
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,640
That's because the Prince said

247
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,140
I look pretty when I wear rhododendron.

248
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,140
So, so,

249
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,440
A few months ago, I went to Noble Consort Xi's palace

250
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,900
and never saw Huanbi.

251
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,600
I heard that Seventeenth Prince was ill

252
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,740
and Huanbi was the one who took care of him.

253
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,550
I was confused then

254
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,630
so it's because of this story between you two.

255
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,540
No wonder!

256
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,750
No wonder that day,

257
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,340
when I was joking with Noble Consort Xi

258
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,740
that I will make you a Lingering,

259
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,940
you were so shocked that you dropped what you were holding.

260
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,440
And no wonder

261
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,140
Old Seventeen hasn't even married a secondary wife.

262
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,240
I am of a lowly bearing and do not dare to climb to Prince's level.

263
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,250
It's just that,

264
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,040
I heard in the Prince's yard,

265
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,040
there are many jade-colored plum flowers.

266
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,570
I haven't had the chance to see them yet.

267
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,990
I just hope that if one day I can see them,

268
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,230
I would be satisifed.

269
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,940
If you guys keep on waiting,

270
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,560
you guys might have to wait another seven years.

271
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,410
Alright, today I will make a decision for you guys.

272
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,740
I'll give Huanbi to you.

273
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,740
Brother

274
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
But my position is lowly,

275
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,320
how can I have the privilege of tending to the Prince?

276
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,240
If it wasn't old Seventeen who personally told you

277
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,840
how would you know that he

278
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,610
has jade-colored plum flowers in his yard?

279
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,140
And your name is Huanbi (bi meaning jade)

280
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,150
Old Seventeen's household needs a mistress to tend to domestic affairs.

281
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,660
You have always been careful and cautious in your service to Noble Consort Xi.

282
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,870
You,

283
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,440
I have no worries.

284
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,740
If you just give Huanbi to the Prince like this,

285
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,840
I don't feel it's appropriate either.

286
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,540
When she enters the Prince's household,

287
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,140
will her position be escort concubine,

288
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,040
secondary wife, or wife?

289
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,580
Huanbi, as a dowry servant of Noble Consort Xi,

290
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,910
it would be too much to make her even an escort concubine.

291
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,640
Back when I left the palace to meditate,

292
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,840
I had only Jinxi and Huanbi by my side.

293
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,640
Huanbi grew up with me and is like a sister to me.

294
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,650
I think, that since the Prince liked Huanbi for seven years,

295
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,640
he must not want to treat her lightly.

296
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,250
Then what do you want?

297
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,540
I want to make Huanbi my godsister,

298
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,540
have her name in the genealogy,

299
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,440
and as Niuhulu clan's second daughter,

300
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,740
marry proudly into Prince Guojun's household as wife.

301
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,440
Noble Consort should know when to stop in sympathizing with Huanbi.

302
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,740
Later when the royal wives enter the palace,

303
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,590
will Huanbi, as the Prince's wife,

304
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,840
be sitting equally with us?

305
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,560
I know that Mistress cares for me,

306
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,740
but I don't care about positions.

307
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,240
Please don't worry for me anymore.

308
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,440
Huanbi,

309
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,440
you don't know how messed-up people can be.

310
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,410
If you marry without a title into the Prince's house,

311
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,240
people will gossip about it.

312
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,640
If well-meaning, they will say that you and the Prince have loved each other for a long time

313
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,240
and that this is fate.

314
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,040
If ill-meaning, they might even say you guys were committing adultery (*palace maids weren't allowed to have romantic affairs)

315
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,740
Both of your reputations would be ruined.

316
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,140
Brother,

317
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,040
forgive me for not marrying Miss Huanbi as my wife.

318
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,470
Many years ago,

319
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,540
I met a lady

320
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,740
whom I had mutual feelings with.

321
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,060
After, even though we were separated by thousands of miles,

322
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,200
and can't become husband and wife,

323
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,770
but in my heart,

324
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,110
she's my only wife.

325
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,240
Though Miss Huanbi is good,

326
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,440
but I will never have her as my wife.

327
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,230
I hope that Noble Consort Xi will understand.

328
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,440
Emperor should make the decision.

329
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,940
Just don't disappoint Huanbi.

330
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,780
I will do as you requested.

331
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,940
I will have Huanbi, as the second daughter of the Niuhulu Clan,

332
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,640
marry Prince Guojun as the secondary wife.

333
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,410
I thank you Emperor.

334
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,740
Congratulations Prince Guojun! Congratulations Miss Huanbi! <br> Get up!

335
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,240
I salute you.

336
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,240
Mistress is drunk.

337
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,240
I will take Mistress outside for some fresh air.

338
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,940
Huanbi, allow me.

339
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,440
Careful.

340
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,240
Careful.

341
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,040
This pair of hands,

342
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,840
this person,

343
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,440
will become Huanbi's from now on.

344
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,340
I know you are upset.

345
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,240
But I'm more upset than you.

346
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,840
Today you celebrate with me,

347
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,140
tomorrow you will be my brother-in-law.

348
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,640
Does it have to be this way?

349
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,340
Look,

350
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,140
the moon is destined to set in the west.

351
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,340
You and I have no other roads to take.

352
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,640
If not this,

353
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,240
the dead won't just be you and me.

354
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,030
Just rumors,

355
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,840
Wen Shichu is an example.

356
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,940
I can't involve you anymore.

357
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,440
That matter from that day,

358
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,600
I hate myself for not being able to help you.

359
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,740
If it was you who was accused that day,

360
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,060
I would have gone crazy.

361
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,440
Huanbi has always liked you.

362
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,540
Her feelings toward you

363
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,950
are no less than mine.

364
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,230
I knew from early on.

365
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,370
Don't disappoint her.

366
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,140
You know,

367
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,460
I only want you.

368
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,140
Today will set the boundary between us.

369
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,040
Before there was only me.

370
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,540
After there will only be Huanbi.

371
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,940
To tell you the truth

372
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,340
Huanbi isn't my godsister,

373
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,240
but my blood sister.

374
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,540
Her mother was my father's lover.

375
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,840
But because her father was a criminal,

376
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:17,010
so father had to hide it

377
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,140
and not let Huanbi be included in the genealogy.

378
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,940
You must treat her well.

379
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,240
The Empress Dowager is very ill.

380
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,940
Your marriage will bring happiness to her.

381
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,550
Though the levels of bearing in this marriage don't match,

382
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,140
but at least you guys have mutual feelings.

383
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,540
I will listen to your arrangements.

384
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,490
On the matter of bearing,

385
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,300
I remember something.

386
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,440
A couple of years ago,

387
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,020
Empress Dowager wanted to arrange a marriage for you.

388
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,770
She was interested in Lord Peiguo's daughter Meng Jingxian.

389
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,440
Meng Jingxian met you once when she was young,

390
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,140
and has liked you ever since.

391
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,840
Yet you still haven't agreed to it.

392
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,340
That Meng Jingxian became obsessed and refused to marry others.

393
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,540
Now she has been delayed and has become an unmarried woman.

394
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,230
The matter of you marrying a secondary wife

395
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,140
has already spread.

396
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,740
Meng Jingxian became very sad

397
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,830
to the extent of being sick in bed.

398
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,640
Lord Peiguo loves his daughter much.

399
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,540
He has already submitted three proposals to me,

400
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,640
asking me to understand his daughter's love for you,

401
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,660
and that he would be willing to marry his daughter off

402
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,040
as an escort concubine to serve you.

403
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,040
So that he won't lose his daughter in his old age.

404
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,740
You know

405
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,680
that I don't want to marry more than I have to.

406
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,740
Besides, I have no feelings for Miss Meng.

407
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,280
I don't want to delay her.

408
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,640
Lord Peiguo has been a court official for two Emperors.

409
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,740
Yet his humble speech reflects his deep love for his daughter.

410
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,440
I can't help but empathize with him.

411
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,820
A man having three or four mistresses

412
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,340
is very normal.

413
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,640
I've made up my mind.

414
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:34,890
Miss Meng and Huanbi will both become your secondary wives.

415
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,640
But I've already wasted so many of her years

416
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,800
so I don't want to drag her along for the rest of her life.

417
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,240
Marriage between royals.

418
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,840
Being genuine is the least important.

419
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,040
I want you to marry her

420
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,040
to reassure the old official.

421
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,640
If you really don't like her

422
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,740
then just care for her at home.

423
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,430
Why let her become so ill that she dies?

424
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,240
If Lord Peiguo holds a grudge because of this,

425
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,390
the politics will be chaotic.

426
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,970
With this said,

427
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,310
I just need to care for her

428
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,940
and treat her well.

429
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,640
I wanted to hear this.

430
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,840
Then I have something to ask.

431
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,290
Speak.

432
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,740
I ask

433
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,700
to never marry others

434
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,350
and I want Huanbi to be in charge of the household.

435
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,540
You haven't even married, yet you're showing favoritism.

436
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,840
Miss Meng's health isn't well.

437
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,990
Putting Huanbi in charge of the household is natural.

438
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,440
Marrying secondary wife

439
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,230
has clothing obtenance, name choice, marriage fortune report,

440
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,240
dowry obtenance, date choice, and wedding as the six customs.

441
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,960
The rest have been done.

442
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,970
There's only the issue of the name.

443
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,370
As a Niuhulu goddaughter,

444
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,440
my family has the characters "Nu" and "Yu" constituting part of the names for the daughters of this generation.

445
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,440
Huanbi counts as the second miss.

446
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,340
The Internal Affairs Department has prepared

447
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,340
a few names starting with Yu.

448
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,810
Huanbi please choose your name.

449
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,080
Huanbi, look at them and see

450
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,540
which one you like.

451
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,740
They're all good names starting with Yu (jade).

452
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,630
Yuqin, Yuyin, Yuqiao

453
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,640
Why do they have Yu but have no Nu?

454
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,940
The names don't appear to be for a blood-born Niuhulu daughter.

455
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,580
The Customs department said that goddaughters aren't born of the family,

456
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,740
and that there must be a distinction.

457
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,350
So only the character Yu will be included in your name.

458
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,040
The doctor said

459
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,030
father's illness has almost fully recovered.

460
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,140
Your mother's entrance into our family temple is more important.

461
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,160
Then I'll have Yuyin (yin meaning hidden)

462
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,340
WIth Niangniang's opinion

463
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,250
the dowry, besides the Internal Affairs Department's,

464
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,140
Palace Yongshou will prepare three times as much

465
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,440
to give to Miss Yuyin as the dowry?

466
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,140
Consort Jing will oversee the wedding.

467
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,240
Zhen household's former servant girl Bin'er

468
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,640
will accompany Miss Yuyin in her marriage.

469
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,520
I won't let your wedding dowry

470
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,190
be less than Lord Peiguo's

471
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,640
and become inferior to his daughter in the future.

472
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,480
Thank you Mistress.

473
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,440
The wedding is on June fourth.

474
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,790
Niangniang's parents

475
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,340
are being arranged to visit inside the palace.

476
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,440
Huaner.

477
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,540
Greetings to father and mother.

478
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,640
Greetins to Noble Consort.

479
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,020
Noble Consort,

480
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,940
You can't perform the great bow to us!

481
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,240
I am not filial,

482
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,620
Carrying Niuhulu's last name,

483
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,140
I couldn't meet you at Yongshou palace.

484
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,290
As long as we reunite as a family

485
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,240
it is the same wherever we go.

486
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,040
Let's get up.

487
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,740
Get up.

488
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,140
Get up.

489
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,240
Come, sit.

490
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,540
In all these years

491
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,590
mother has grown many white hairs.

492
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,240
We've endured all these years.

493
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,640
And now we've gotten out of it.

494
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,380
Back when our family was in decline,

495
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,170
I was just afraid that it would trouble you too.

496
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,540
We're a family. Don't speak of troubling each other.

497
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,640
Now it's all better

498
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,660
and Yuying is getting married.

499
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,660
Yuying having this fate

500
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,120
her mother,

501
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:57,270
can rest in peace now.

502
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,540
Although it's secondary wife,

503
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,840
but Yuying sincerely likes the lord.

504
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,940
Her wish has been granted.

505
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,840
This is all to your trouble.

506
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,940
You have worried much for her.

507
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,740
Parents living at an inn

508
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,140
is not a long term solution.

509
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,280
The Emperor has people fixing up Zhen estate.

510
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,430
Mother and father can live peacefully.

511
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,200
His Majesty allowing us to visit you in the palace

512
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,720
is already a huge gift of kindness.

513
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,820
How can we ask to live in this city for such a long time?

514
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,940
Being able to see you and the grandchild is satisfying.

515
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,840
I am much comforted.

516
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,040
I don't ask for anything else.

517
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,540
Since you've returned,

518
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,340
I won't let you

519
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,140
return to the poor mountains.

520
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,040
Using this return

521
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,480
I will find a way to ask the Emperor

522
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,640
to investigate that year's events.

523
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,140
Originally

524
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,340
Second Miss has always worn jade-colored clothing.

525
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,040
Who would have thought that you wearing red is even prettier?

526
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,240
It's a pity that it's only secondary wife,

527
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,640
and I can't wear true red.

528
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,940
Very beautiful, so pretty.

529
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,340
Thank you, older sister, for arranging all of this.

530
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,440
Tomorrow is the big day.

531
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,140
The lord doesn't have a wife

532
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,330
and there's only Meng Jingxian who ranks the same as you.

533
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,140
You must not endure everything quietly

534
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,690
but you also must not nitpick on everything.

535
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,640
Live a peaceful life.

536
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,140
The lord said

537
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,000
that you will be in charge of everything at his estate.

538
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,940
Balance justice and mercy.

539
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,140
The upper and lower households must be treated appropriately.

540
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,180
Sister, I'm sorry.

541
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,140
This position should have been yours.

542
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
I took your position.

543
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,520
My position is the Emperor's Noble Consort Xi.

544
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,640
How did you take mine?

545
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,970
Tomorrow you are to wed.

546
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,800
You need to be very happy.

547
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,180
Don't think too much about other things.

548
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,740
Sister.

549
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,500
I know you are sad.

550
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,920
The bride needs to be happy,

551
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,500
how can you cry?

552
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,240
Sister, do you regret it?

553
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,610
That year

554
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,840
if you waited a few more months

555
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,940
today the person marrying the lord

556
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
wouldn't be me.

557
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,960
I chose my own path

558
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,240
so there's no going back.

559
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,740
Living in the palace is too difficult.

560
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,440
I don't have the time, or mood to regret anything.

561
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,100
Your future path has been determined by your choice today.

562
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,930
I hope that

563
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,040
you can always move on with out regretting anything.

564
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,430
Sister I'm afraid.

565
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,240
I am worried that the lord's heart will only have you.

566
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,890
I don't know

567
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,740
how to be this secondary wife.

568
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,740
For your matter, I am an outsider.

569
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,590
Prince Guojun household's husband is you and the prince.

570
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,700
How to accomplish this is all up to you.

571
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,340
I can only tell you to be genuine.

572
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,820
Being genuine is the most important.

573
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,540
Sister

574
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,840
I will use all of my heart to treat the lord well.

575
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,540
I will be filial to his mother.

576
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,620
You just need to remember

577
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,740
that from now on, on our shoulders

578
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,840
we carry the Zhen family's future.

579
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,340
Remember.

580
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,840
You are the lord's secondary wife.

581
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,640
Niuhulu Yuyin bids farewell to Noble Consort Xi.

582
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,830
Take care of yourself.

583
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,680
The lucky time has come, and the lord's estate is ready.

584
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,340
Lord Peiguo's is already on their way.

585
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,950
Second miss may leave now.

586
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,210
Go.

587
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,590
I'd rather it was you.

588
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,440
That way he'd be happy.

589
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,940
Yuying has more fortune than I do.

590
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,720
Marrying two at once.

591
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,440
But both are not the ones he wants.

592
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,440
Raise the sedan.

593
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,740
Time's mistiming has never stopped.

594
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,540
It's normal.

595
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,640
Congratulations!

596
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,940
Congratulations Lord Guojing!

597
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,340
Come, let's drink!

598
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,440
So lucky!

599
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,640
Two secondary wives.

600
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,340
Right, congratulations.

601
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,440
Congratulations!

602
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,640
Happy!

603
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,040
Congratulations!

604
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,240
Lord, lord.

605
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,640
Come, get up.

606
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,040
Don't touch me.

607
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,840
I'm fine.

608
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,390
I'm fine.

609
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,240
Lord, two secondary wives, you need to say something.

610
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,040
Who's place are you going to sleep tonight?

611
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,640
Lord, it's your big night.

612
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,990
You can't just not go to any of them.

613
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,940
Lord. Lord!

614
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,590
Huan...Huanbi.

615
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,730
Okay. To Changqing Ge!

616
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,340
Lord.

617
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,360
Miss, it's time to sleep.

618
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,540
Changqing Ge's lights have gone out.

619
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,740
Meng Jingxian

620
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,640
I knew what it would be like after I married him.

621
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,640
This is only the first night.

622
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,940
You are sighing already.

623
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,640
From now on there will be more days to sigh.
