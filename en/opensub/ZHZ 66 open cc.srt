1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
how has it be prepared for the memorial of Hui Fei's seven days?

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,300
it is ready

3
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:14,260
a service is carrying on at the Baohua Temple

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,800
I was thinking

5
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:21,669
a serve cannot comfort the soul of the Sister in heaven

6
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:27,102
you had ordered to kill Jingbai and Feiwen at the time

7
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:29,543
Chenqie don't think that's enough

8
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:32,868
Guaerjia shi instigated the discontent in the Harem

9
00:00:32,943 --> 00:00:35,386
and her father staged troubles at the court

10
00:00:35,386 --> 00:00:39,188
do the father and daughter want to push our family to the path of death?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,600
Zhen know you don't like

12
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:48,341
yet the harem and the court connects in such way that touches one hair would move whole body

13
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:50,743
things cannot be rushed

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,986
your name is Yurao

15
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:58,092
Huangshang knew but still ask

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,400
a person of Rao means is enchantingly beautiful and charming

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,100
your beauty doesn't match your strong personality

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,300
a young woman should be gentle and soft

19
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:18,856
Zhen award you a name: Yuwan, what do you think?

20
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:22,574
the word, Wan, is alright; where is its origin from?

21
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:27,061
Huangshang award a name to the third sister, it can't be randomly picked

22
00:01:27,093 --> 00:01:32,577
praise her beautiful shape, miss her charming gentleness

23
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:37,680
from Zhang Hua's Missing Forever, a sentence praising beauties

24
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,980
praise a beauty's enchantment, her eyes charmed the whole country

25
00:01:41,022 --> 00:01:43,614
this poem is eulogy for a dead beauty

26
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:46,856
I am alive and well standing in front of Huangshang

27
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:50,257
Zhen just made an anology

28
00:01:56,145 --> 00:02:00,753
Zhang hua's poem of Missing Forever was to commemorate his dead wife

29
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:02,703
Emperor,

30
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,800
you don't think to have Yurao as a wife, do you?

31
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:14,459
it's extremely distinctive between wife and concubines in the harem

32
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,056
wife is Empress, I have no intention to get a wife

33
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:23,981
Chenqie have less forture to be a wife, willingly serve huangshang with my life

34
00:02:24,017 --> 00:02:26,136
but Yurao's temperament is proud and strong

35
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:29,416
not suit to be a concubine to serve

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,100
though you are concubine but you're Zhen's favor

37
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:38,255
and titled Guifei, under only one person

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,700
if your sister is like you, it wouldn't be bad

39
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:44,770
though the 17th Prince likes my second sister

40
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,500
she's still second wife

41
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,000
Chenqie have no heart to go after the position of Empress

42
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,600
but do you want to see all my sisters be concubines?

43
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,200
only awarded a name

44
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,400
.didn't expect that caused your sadness. it's Zhen's careless

45
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,700
the word, Wan, is not good. let's not talk about it

46
00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:16,144
your sister is still young

47
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:20,664
if there is a good family, Zhen will pay attention

48
00:03:20,713 --> 00:03:23,384
not talk about it now

49
00:03:24,468 --> 00:03:27,180
Yurao saw the misfortune of the family when I was small

50
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:30,141
Huangshang asked why my personality was so strong

51
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:35,144
if Huangshang knew what I experienced and how I went to Ningguta with my parents

52
00:03:35,184 --> 00:03:38,223
and how much we suffered, you'd have the answer

53
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,100
zhen like to hear

54
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,400
Emperor leaves.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,500
Chenqie see Huangshang off

56
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Huangshang didn't say other things and put this into my hand

57
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:09,304
said he'll take it back later

58
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,300
this pendant of mandarin duck

59
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:14,366
is carried by Huangshang everyday

60
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,600
thus, sister

61
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,200
I can't keep this

62
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,000
Huangshang treasures this pendant very much

63
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,700
maybe you look too much like Cunyuan Empress

64
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:34,984
Zhen Yurao is Zhen Yurao, I can be only unique, not a substitute

65
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,193
good

66
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,822
this is our Zhen's daughter

67
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:47,106
Huangshang, it's time for your nap

68
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,900
you won't be spirited in the afternoon otherwise

69
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:58,221
Huangshang, your jade pendant you carried all the time, how come it's not there?

70
00:04:58,276 --> 00:05:00,256
Zhen awarded to Yurao

71
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,800
Third Miss? --- what then?

72
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,500
Nucai thought the third miss is really lucky

73
00:05:06,502 --> 00:05:10,317
that jade pendant was the favorite piece of Cunyuan Empress

74
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:12,904
is this called lucky?

75
00:05:12,952 --> 00:05:17,914
the time she's lucky is in future. put up the resting incense

76
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:19,030
Yes

77
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,100
I heard Huangshang punished the family of Guaerjia Shi because of her disrespect

78
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,200
that exposed her mother E Min

79
00:05:30,223 --> 00:05:33,672
has been framed ministers, formed sect, and done some dirty business

80
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,200
behaved cruel and merciless, and etc. these years

81
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,500
in a month, house raided, imprisoned, and exiled

82
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,200
Huangshang is busy in the court and our ears are as busy

83
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:51,139
E Min had committed suicide in prison in desperation

84
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:56,223
in fact, Huangshang had to know some of the Guaerjia clan are not punished

85
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:02,600
only one thing in the court could affect many other things, it has to be cautious

86
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:05,941
do it slowly is a way

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,600
I thought the moves by Emperor seem to want to cut off their foundation

88
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,800
when it would see results if doing it slowly?

89
00:06:15,947 --> 00:06:20,699
if don't count all crimes. how criminals be all captured and root of the cause be eliminated?

90
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,900
Guaerjia Wenyuan is arrogant, and her father is not better

91
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,700
Huangshang moved with thunderbolt, and they had no time to hit back

92
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,700
Empress niangniang, Empress niangniang

93
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:46,584
Empress Niang Niang!

94
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,183
Empress Niang Niang! <br> Don't run!

95
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,829
stop, stop

96
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:55,403
stop

97
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,500
Empress Niang Niang! Empress Niang! <br> Stop!

98
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:05,614
Chenqie Guaerjia Shi beg to see Emppress niangniang

99
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,525
stop

100
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:12,823
Guaerjia Shi

101
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:16,590
adult males all have their heads cut off

102
00:07:19,464 --> 00:07:23,425
less than 14 years old, exile to western border area

103
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:28,144
wives and daughters become servants

104
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Emperor, Emperor!

105
00:07:30,262 --> 00:07:37,575
beg to forgive my family, Huangshang

106
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,300
Emperor!

107
00:07:39,384 --> 00:07:41,498
Su Peisheng

108
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,378
Nucai is here

109
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,600
to tell Guaerjia Shi, consider she served me so many years

110
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:54,379
demote her as ordinary person, not death

111
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:55,302
Emperor,

112
00:07:55,358 --> 00:08:01,419
please forgive my family, Huangshang, I live worse than die

113
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,945
Huangshang, you believed a slut

114
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:06,618
wronged your loyal minister

115
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:09,221
Zhen Huan, you slut

116
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:13,498
I won't forgive you if I become a ghost; come out, Zhen Huan

117
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:16,982
why you are still watching?

118
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:18,662
go handling it

119
00:08:18,705 --> 00:08:20,136
Yes

120
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:24,219
Zhen Huan, slut, I won't forgive you if I'm a ghost

121
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:27,298
I want to become a horrific ghost

122
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,900
bury in a wilderness, and not tell Huangshang

123
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,981
so that get Huangshang's ear dirty

124
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:08,791
Zhen'll write another edict

125
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,500
exonerate your father's wrongs for many years, and restore his position

126
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,200
thanks Huangshang

127
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,400
don't give Chenqie's father higher position, he's really old now

128
00:09:23,383 --> 00:09:26,841
then Zhen will give hjavascript:void(0);im

129
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,100
ceremonial position of fourth level, let him growing old peacefully

130
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,300
thanks Huangshang

131
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,000
know why she didn't have a good death?

132
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,943
Chenqie don't know

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,300
she's too useless. useless person in the Harem has no other way out except death

134
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:59,121
women in the Harem are difficult to dealing with. we have to be more careful

135
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,200
yes

136
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,900
Why didn't Sister interrogate more of Guaerjia?

137
00:10:06,903 --> 00:10:09,103
let her accuse Empress was the chief plotter

138
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:13,323
there are people in the clan alive, and she wouldn't involve them

139
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:17,064
and she hated me in her bones

140
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:19,782
how could she accuse the one that can control me?

141
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:23,491
Wangye has collected the criminal evidence of the Guaerjia clan for years

142
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,310
they can finally be used now

143
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,000
the 17th Prince is your husband and helping his father-in-law is reasonable

144
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,000
you live outside, you and Wangye need to take care of the family

145
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,820
of course, don't worry, Sister

146
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,200
Wangye could make so much effort, it's because your effort at the Royal Household

147
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:47,229
is it easy to be with Meng Jingxian?

148
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:49,660
did she wrong you?

149
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:51,128
how could she?

150
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:53,544
her health is improving lately

151
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,703
but she still take medicine daily

152
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,764
Wangye pities her and she has everything

153
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,500
but they don't talk much

154
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:09,915
Wangye didn't have much feelings to her

155
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:12,727
not like you that knew Wangye for many years

156
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,600
Sister is mocking me

157
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:20,608
but Wangye treats me really well

158
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,400
Sister, I want to go out

159
00:11:24,544 --> 00:11:28,488
Sanmei dresses so pretty, where are you going?

160
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,868
I don't know where she's going. a growing up girl has more ideas, I can't watch her closely

161
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:38,204
yesterday I heard from Wangye that Shen Beile went to see Dowager

162
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:40,501
and ran into our third sister

163
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,200
don't know why but both were blushed. and Dowager felt strange

164
00:11:45,461 --> 00:11:47,583
when this happened?

165
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,223
what did you mean, Sister?

166
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,871
Shen Beile, since when?

167
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,800
about... I don't remember

168
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,203
don't you care his mother was from a low background?

169
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:03,524
he never looked down upon me

170
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:07,681
I remember someone used to say

171
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,700
I'd rather marry an ordinary man than enter a royal house

172
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:15,484
I don't know who said that

173
00:12:15,564 --> 00:12:17,771
don't laugh at me, sister

174
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,200
Yunxi, he's different than Huangshang, he's good

175
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:25,727
if you really mean it

176
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:29,964
I can go to Huangshang, ask him to permit your marriage

177
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:34,254
only one thing, you can't sneak out to see him

178
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,400
so that become laughable when others know

179
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,700
alright. Sister Yuying, I'm leaving

180
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:45,162
Sister have decided?

181
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:49,655
you and I can tell the intention of Huangshang to Yurao

182
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:54,669
it's better to marry her now since the situation is still easy to deal with

183
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:58,971
I think back and forth that it's useless if just marrying an ordinary family

184
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:04,044
only marrying Huangshang's brother could stop Huangshang's idea

185
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:06,961
otherwise there would be a lot of troubles in future

186
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,100
that's good. fortunately Shen Beile and Third Sister are like each other

187
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,300
that save a lot of troubles

188
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,100
only not many concubines in the harem

189
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,663
the eyes of Huangshang are looking at Yurao all the time

190
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,200
have to find a way to have Huangshang looking somewhere else

191
00:13:27,063 --> 00:13:32,140
don't worry, Sister. let me take up the task

192
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:37,571
Caiping, how many years have you been with Wangye?

193
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,433
five or six years

194
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,800
did Wangye treat you well? Wangye is my savior

195
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,800
did you know Wangye's situation in the court?

196
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,300
Huangshang has many brothers

197
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:55,532
but he cares few

198
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,900
some demoted, some imprisoned, don't know when Wangye would be the same situation

199
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,700
our Huangshang

200
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,000
not lenient even to blood brothers

201
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:09,650
Ce Fujing

202
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:13,647
come

203
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,500
we're outside, don't know the emotions of Huangshang

204
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,900
if there is someone closed to Huangshang

205
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,500
that comes from our house

206
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,100
that could make Huangshang happy

207
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,100
wouldn't our house have a layer of assurance?

208
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,293
Ce Fujin means...

209
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:42,729
Nubi can't carry such a big task

210
00:14:42,736 --> 00:14:47,733
you can. our royal house including Qingliang Terrace

211
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:50,039
you are the most beautiful girl

212
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:53,733
in addition, you are so loyal to Wangye

213
00:14:53,772 --> 00:14:57,348
you are the only one that can do this

214
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:58,540
Nubi...

215
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:05,300
if you still remember how Wangye treats you, you should think for our house

216
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,900
don't worry

217
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:10,618
Huangshang'll like you for certain

218
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,560
Emperor will definitely like you.

219
00:15:13,571 --> 00:15:14,572
Nubi...

220
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,890
will obey the order of Ce Fujin

221
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,400
did Guifei niangniang know

222
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,000
someone exposed that the father of An Pin extorted 80 million taes of silver and several houses

223
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,600
Huangshang is really angry this time

224
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:39,465
I didn't know if Guiren didn't tell me

225
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:43,088
everyone in the harem gossips about this

226
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:47,934
Guifei looks at this bird how white its feathers are like snow

227
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:54,489
would An Bihuai see this bird made of silver?

228
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:56,968
guiren is good at making joke

229
00:15:57,015 --> 00:15:59,887
three years clean county head, could make 100,000 tael of silver

230
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,700
let alone An Bihuai is a father-in-law of the Emperor, 80 million taels is nothing

231
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,300
his so-called father-in-law was named by himself, he cheated only idiot

232
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,509
Huangshang didn't view him that way

233
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:14,062
he's rid of official position, and put into prison

234
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,600
the daughter gets favor of Emperor is most important; it doesn't matter he's real father-in-law or not

235
00:16:18,663 --> 00:16:20,451
Guiren is smart

236
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:24,521
had your father paying attention in secret that caught An Bihuai

237
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:26,834
otherwise An Pin is too pleased

238
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:32,386
if it's not for Niangniang's plan, it would still be useless even I had the evidence of An Bihuai

239
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:36,621
Huangshang is angry of the Guaerjia Clan, it's his misfortune that he ram into it

240
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:42,668
furthermore, his county head was due to Huangshang's favor to An Pin

241
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:46,344
this is like slapping on Huangshang's face and made Huangshang a laughing stuff

242
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:51,151
I heard that An Pin has been kneeing outside the Yangxin Palace,

243
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:53,598
crying for two days

244
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:00,979
Greetings to Niangniang

245
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:02,328
Su Gonggong

246
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,700
Huangshang asks to have dinner with Niangniang at the Yangxin palace

247
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:08,132
Niangniang, please

248
00:17:08,168 --> 00:17:09,690
I know

249
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,582
Pinqie wouldn't bother more

250
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,071
farewell

251
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,800
why is Sister an doing this?

252
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:37,978
your health is more important

253
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:42,448
Sister won't deny my opportunity to beg forgiveness?

254
00:17:42,448 --> 00:17:43,578
how could I?

255
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:47,490
I worry about that it's late in night and windy and cold

256
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,760
Sister is harmed in case

257
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,608
maybe

258
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:55,811
a mouse comes from somewhere and bites Sister

259
00:17:55,889 --> 00:17:58,092
what to do if you get sick?

260
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:00,610
Sister is joking

261
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:03,768
how could there be mouse in yangxin Palace

262
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,688
yes, I forgot

263
00:18:08,738 --> 00:18:11,891
these are in the prison only

264
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:14,652
I worried about wrong thing

265
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:17,411
I shouldn't worry about Sister An

266
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:19,755
but to worry...

267
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:22,805
Uncle An

268
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,538
Niangniang happy

269
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,800
Greetings to the Emperor.

270
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,937
Zhen's been waiting for you for a while

271
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,700
Chenqie saw Sister An kneeing outside, I felt pity and offered a few advices

272
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,647
how could she listen?

273
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,600
she has only her becoming nothing father right now in her heart. Zhen gave him a county head

274
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
offered a promotion path

275
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:03,349
he ravaged it that had me lost face

276
00:19:03,372 --> 00:19:05,371
don't be angry, Huangshang

277
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:10,051
no matter how bad, An Bihuai is An Bihuai, it shouldn't be involved with Sister An

278
00:19:10,097 --> 00:19:12,608
Huangshang let her get up

279
00:19:12,689 --> 00:19:15,211
Zhen never wanted to punish her

280
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:20,528
it's herself wanting to knee there to take punishment for her father; most improper

281
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:22,982
Sister An is anxious to saving her father

282
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:25,467
Huangshang don't blame her

283
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,000
would Huangshang forgive An Bihuai? --- how could I?

284
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,200
Zhen won't shift my angry to her

285
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:37,274
but also won't forgive her father because of her

286
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,876
sister An hasn't drink and eat for two days

287
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:42,903
and has no sleep and rest

288
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:47,023
Huangshang didn't worry about her?

289
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,900
self harm of concubine is a big crime, and will cause harm to her family

290
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,983
she wouldn't dare

291
00:19:58,344 --> 00:20:00,140
Emperor.

292
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,600
Sister An dresses plain

293
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:06,141
causes pity more than usual

294
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:07,783
yet regretable

295
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,475
what?

296
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,400
the pure and white are cleanest originally

297
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:18,147
shouldn't be intertwined with lust

298
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,583
involved with lust

299
00:20:20,628 --> 00:20:23,100
dirties the nature of pure and white

300
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,300
it's late and cold. take An Pin back

301
00:20:28,443 --> 00:20:31,211
zhen will imprison An Bihuai

302
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,000
you beg more, Zhen will kill him!

303
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:36,887
Emperor,

304
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,400
Emperor!

305
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,600
Emperor!

306
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,200
Emperor,

307
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,600
Emperor!

308
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:05,780
Chenqie beg Empress to save Chenqie's father

309
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:10,303
Bengong are afraid that I couldn't even I wanted to

310
00:21:10,345 --> 00:21:14,982
if Niangniang are willing to lend a helping hand

311
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,262
Chenqie will serve Niangniang to my death

312
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,800
it's not Bengong didn't want to help you this tiem

313
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:25,662
I'm afraid that only you can help yourself

314
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,829
Niangniang, please state it clearly for me

315
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:34,362
Huangshang is kind, and care about children

316
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,600
you serve Huangshang for many years, and never got pregnant

317
00:21:39,543 --> 00:21:43,636
Bengong has a secret prescription that is very effective

318
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:46,085
but the drug is risky and dangerous

319
00:21:46,128 --> 00:21:51,094
if you get pregnant and favor of Huangshang

320
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:53,855
huangshang would extend his favor of you to the crows on your roof naturally

321
00:21:54,483 --> 00:21:57,364
but Chenqie has been used the muscle resting pill

322
00:21:57,425 --> 00:22:03,214
even I'm pregnant, I won't carry it to birth, I'm afraid

323
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,700
since your pregnancy would solve immediate trouble, it's not necessary to give birth

324
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,516
I heard from Yuying that Huangshang is interested in Yurao

325
00:22:19,531 --> 00:22:23,299
if Xi Guifei pleas, it would be good if Huangshang allows the marriage

326
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:25,677
if not

327
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:28,410
how do you plan to do?

328
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,700
I'm a Beile that gets the least attention. I don't want anything

329
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,989
Yurao is the only thing I want

330
00:22:36,013 --> 00:22:38,532
but you have to know

331
00:22:38,572 --> 00:22:42,932
we can't fight anything over Huangshang no matter how we try

332
00:22:43,014 --> 00:22:46,956
Huangshang can get a person, can he get the heart of someone?

333
00:22:46,972 --> 00:22:52,417
even if I won't be successful, I have to try with all my heart

334
00:22:52,462 --> 00:22:59,148
I had lost someone I loved, so I understand how you feel

335
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,500
I ask you one word only, are you really serious about Yurao?

336
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,900
my heart is like stone

337
00:23:07,918 --> 00:23:10,368
can't be changed

338
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,900
I've know his feeling sometimes ago

339
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:19,413
it's worth the effort for how he feels about Yurao

340
00:23:19,494 --> 00:23:20,866
don't worry

341
00:23:20,897 --> 00:23:24,851
though we don't have 100% certainty for this

342
00:23:24,894 --> 00:23:29,274
we have to try our best so that the sister won't be regretted for the rest of her life

343
00:23:29,293 --> 00:23:33,413
now Dowager is in critical condition, we have to try this as early as possible

344
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:39,900
so that you won't have to wait for three years in case Dowager is passed away

345
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,900
I've done the thing Older Sister asked last time

346
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:46,411
the new concubine will enter the Harem this afternoon

347
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:50,476
what kind of person? --- Sister know her, Caiping

348
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,900
how could be her?

349
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,300
she's lucky. Huangshang has awarded her Ying Daying

350
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,139
Emperor,

351
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,600
the person from Jingshi house is here

352
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,600
Emperor,

353
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,600
the person from the 17 Prince's House is here?

354
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:28,783
yes, she's lived in Changchun Palace. --- how does she look?

355
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,400
this is the person picked by Yu Fujin, she is very good naturally

356
00:24:32,534 --> 00:24:36,129
it's nice of the 17th Prince house

357
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm busy at the court and hadn't found time to walk with you lately

358
00:24:43,055 --> 00:24:46,372
Huangshang made up to me today?

359
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,500
you mock Zhen again

360
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,900
you showed up in front of Zhen intentionally?

361
00:25:12,035 --> 00:25:13,418
intentional is unnecessary

362
00:25:13,486 --> 00:25:16,373
such thing happens everyday

363
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,099
their feeling is deep that

364
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,216
why don't we fulfill their desire since we had gone through the experience before?

365
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:25,773
Xi Guifei, you are so smart that

366
00:25:25,812 --> 00:25:29,852
you should've know how I feel about Yurao

367
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:36,100
Huangshang is smarter 100 times than Chenqie, how couldn't you know that king has desire, fairy has no dream

368
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,700
Zhen has a way to deal with that

369
00:25:38,818 --> 00:25:42,611
even Huangshang has a way, shouldn't you ask how Yurao feels about it?

370
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,300
what benefit if she's forced?

371
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,400
Shen Beila is your blood brother

372
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,600
Huangshang doesn't approve that you and I are together

373
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,962
I'll keep begging if Huangshang is not allowed

374
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,700
if he's not allowed, I won't marry like the 17th brother

375
00:26:09,971 --> 00:26:13,291
in a word, I'll never let you down

376
00:26:13,362 --> 00:26:15,972
and won't marry anyone else

377
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:22,900
I know, before dust is settled, you have a lot of worries. I promise you one word

378
00:26:22,973 --> 00:26:25,009
don't worry

379
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,300
I know

380
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,200
go to Ying Daying.

381
00:26:31,232 --> 00:26:32,990
Huangshang, you forgot that

382
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:37,747
you had awarded Ying Daying as Changzai, she is having the award ceremony

383
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,300
okay. that won't be finished for a while

384
00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:48,126
then, where are we going?

385
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:51,085
go to Yanxi Palace

386
00:26:51,129 --> 00:26:53,857
Get ready to go to Yan Xi Palace.

387
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,900
Huangshang went away with a long face, what's going on?

388
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:01,087
I have to do it no matter what

389
00:27:01,128 --> 00:27:04,905
Nubi worry that Huangshang is really angry that would harm Niangniang

390
00:27:06,985 --> 00:27:08,781
Sister

391
00:27:10,323 --> 00:27:15,684
look at you, didn't even know to wipe out your sweat, really like a child

392
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,100
are you happy to see Shen Baile today? ---happy

393
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,600
I'm happy to see him and talk with him

394
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,700
it's good you're happy

395
00:27:25,716 --> 00:27:28,828
Oldest Sister wish you will always be happy like today

396
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,340
Oldest sister.

397
00:27:31,144 --> 00:27:33,709
as long as you're happy

398
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,943
Sister will do anything for you

399
00:28:22,502 --> 00:28:24,550
ten thousand peaces to Huangshang

400
00:28:24,581 --> 00:28:26,224
rise

401
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,100
what you played is Qi Ao

402
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:36,223
have Yurao had a gentleman you admire and miss?

403
00:28:36,272 --> 00:28:40,943
do you know Zhen as a gentleman like Yurao playing the Qin very much?

404
00:28:41,003 --> 00:28:44,703
is Huangshang like Chennu because of my sister?

405
00:28:44,745 --> 00:28:46,908
people say that Yurao has resemblance of Sister

406
00:28:46,952 --> 00:28:50,263
you resemble her, yet not resemble her

407
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:55,199
you have heroine beauty that she doesn't have

408
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:00,000
on appearance, you resemble my late wife

409
00:29:00,186 --> 00:29:01,463
really?

410
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,200
Chennu seem not resemble Empress

411
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,400
she is Empress, not my wife. my wife passed away long time ago

412
00:29:10,502 --> 00:29:13,822
Chennu understand. Huangshang can have many empresses

413
00:29:13,864 --> 00:29:16,944
but have only one wife

414
00:29:16,983 --> 00:29:18,740
. you are smart. --- how about my sister?

415
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:24,675
your sister is Zhen's most important woman

416
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:30,063
you asked so many questions, do you want to be Zhen's woman?

417
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:34,068
Chennu admire Huangshang's wife

418
00:29:34,103 --> 00:29:35,623
why?

419
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,600
though Huangshang's wife passed away long time ago, Huangshang still consider herself as wife only

420
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,700
and constantly thinks of her.

421
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:45,481
Huangshang said like Yurao, right?

422
00:29:45,503 --> 00:29:46,941
Yes.

423
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,400
Chennu have a wish since I was little to become the wife of someone I love

424
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:57,409
not concubine, not most important woman, but the only wife that he loves most

425
00:29:57,489 --> 00:30:02,931
it's pity Huangshang have wife already, and can't fulfill my wish

426
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:07,090
Chennu hope to realize my wish someday,

427
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,100
not admire huangshang's wife forever

428
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:17,449
Zhen said that you are smart, and very much like your sister

429
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,753
this is not smart, it is fact

430
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:23,379
if Huangshang like Chennu and keep Chennu In the Harem

431
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,400
what could Huangshang bring me? or abolish Empress and take me to Jingren Palace?

432
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,200
Empress is only Empress, not Huangshang's wife

433
00:30:33,256 --> 00:30:40,145
forgive my talkative, Huangshang and your wife loved each other, right?

434
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:47,400
Chennu and Yunxi love each other. Chennu wouldn't dare to ask Huangshang allow me to be his formal wife

435
00:30:47,618 --> 00:30:53,578
it's okay that I'll be his concubine as long as we can be together, I beg Huangshang

436
00:30:53,671 --> 00:30:56,537
didn't you want only be his wife?

437
00:30:56,616 --> 00:30:59,745
Empress is Huangshang's wife in title

438
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:02,546
but Huangshang doesn't view her as wife

439
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:06,697
though Chennu couldn't be wife in name for Yunxi

440
00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:10,098
his heart has me only and my heart have him

441
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:17,300
Chennu know he won't marry anyone else, and Chennu is the only one he loves, am I not the wife in his heart?

442
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:20,618
you stand up

443
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:25,695
Chennu know Huangshagn like me; since like, Huangshang should fulfill my wish

444
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:33,626
besides Empress, Huangshang have so many women; I entered the harem not long and I saw Sister suffered so much twist and turns

445
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:38,737
though Huangshang thought Sister is the most important woman, she has to live extremely diligently and cautiously

446
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,300
Chennu don't want to live life like that in future

447
00:31:44,497 --> 00:31:48,077
Huangshang's like is precious and Chennu won't dare to disappoint you

448
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,665
but love in the world is not only restricted between man and woman

449
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:57,581
Chennu beg Huangshang like me as a younger sister

450
00:31:57,632 --> 00:32:00,540
this is the pendant Huangshang let me to keep, Chennu return it now

451
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:07,200
please allow Chennu and Yunxi's wish

452
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,800
this jade pendant, Zhen award to you

453
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Huangshang, the lamp is dim, don't hurt your eyes

454
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,900
Nucai change a bright one for you

455
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,100
Emperor,

456
00:32:52,226 --> 00:32:56,187
Zhen had my eyes on a woman

457
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,482
want to take her as concubine but she is not willing

458
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,959
what do you think?

459
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,525
Nucai don't know what kind of person this woman is

460
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:10,706
but Nucai thought that no matter how good this woman is, she can't compare to Cunyuan Empress

461
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,902
what do you mean?

462
00:33:12,972 --> 00:33:16,660
Nucai thought, it doesn't matter whom Huangshang like

463
00:33:16,714 --> 00:33:19,418
it is her luck to make Huangshang happy

464
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,900
for Cunyuan empress

465
00:33:23,097 --> 00:33:25,240
you

466
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,896
seeing things too cruel

467
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:37,100
alright. one thing that Zhen want you to deal with for me

468
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:42,697
Xi Guifei marries her sister, can follow Princess Duoluo to prepare for dowry

469
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:52,023
Yunxi marries, promote Xi Taipin to Taifei; Dowager has been ill

470
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,979
having some happy things in the Harem

471
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,860
view it as warding off sickness for Dowager

472
00:33:57,942 --> 00:34:04,183
Guifei marries younger sister, Emperor marries younger brother, such a rare happy occasion

473
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:09,511
Dowager will get better if she know such happy thing

474
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,218
Dowager, Dowager

475
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,000
Ai Jia am afraid that I won't last long

476
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,600
Don't say that, Dowager. doctors are waiting outside

477
00:34:39,701 --> 00:34:41,660
Nubi have them in

478
00:34:41,697 --> 00:34:42,827
Zhuxi

479
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:46,620
Ai Jia is muddle headed

480
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,678
but in my head

481
00:34:49,697 --> 00:34:52,777
one idea is turning around

482
00:34:52,845 --> 00:34:55,940
Aijia have been

483
00:34:55,989 --> 00:35:00,340
protecting Yihiu the position of Empress

484
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,715
for the glory of Wulanala clan and Wuya clan

485
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:08,980
am I wrong?

486
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,600
Dowager, don't say that

487
00:35:12,669 --> 00:35:15,541
At that time, what Yixiu

488
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,473
did to Chunyuan,

489
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,302
it was not that Aijia didn't know

490
00:35:23,385 --> 00:35:26,140
but I couldn't find another way

491
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:32,500
if Yihiu died, Wulanala clan

492
00:35:32,501 --> 00:35:36,488
would have no one to inherit the position of Empress

493
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:44,600
Aijia tried and suffered so much to become Dowager

494
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:52,194
I couldn't lose the effort I put in with all my life

495
00:35:52,223 --> 00:35:55,181
therefore even I knew

496
00:35:55,233 --> 00:36:00,704
Yihiu harmed concubines and children of Emperor

497
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:04,781
Aijia had to save her position of Empress

498
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:09,269
save her position of Empress

499
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:12,663
Dowager advised Empress many times

500
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,984
it was Empress who refused to repent

501
00:36:16,058 --> 00:36:18,391
it is Empress that killed so many people

502
00:36:18,463 --> 00:36:23,023
if she listened to Dowager and repent, it would be good

503
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,916
no matter how much Aijia didn't like her,

504
00:36:25,943 --> 00:36:31,300
I have to care about the glory of the clan

505
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,100
these days

506
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:44,031
Aijia dreamt about Cunyuan every night

507
00:36:45,221 --> 00:36:49,143
Aijia owe her

508
00:36:49,183 --> 00:36:51,810
Dowager said

509
00:36:51,823 --> 00:36:54,104
Cunyuan Empress was too soft

510
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,900
to be Empress in charge of the Harem

511
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,400
only Yihiu could keep the position of Empress

512
00:37:01,503 --> 00:37:04,943
not fall into other's hand

513
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:07,944
Aijia also let Emperor down

514
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:12,704
let down those royal grandchildren who died wrongfully

515
00:37:14,263 --> 00:37:16,981
yet now

516
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,500
Aijia can have Emperor listen to me one day

517
00:37:21,635 --> 00:37:25,358
but not his whole life

518
00:37:25,378 --> 00:37:29,389
my hearty and bloody efforts...

519
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,100
don't worry so much

520
00:37:34,303 --> 00:37:37,727
give me brush and paper

521
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,042
Aijia, Aijia want to leave a testamentary edict

522
00:37:42,084 --> 00:37:44,269
in case

523
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:48,784
Dowager, you want to pay more attention to your illness

524
00:37:49,451 --> 00:37:53,257
you must remember

525
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:57,737
in case I'm not here

526
00:37:57,779 --> 00:38:01,010
you safe keep this edict

527
00:38:02,773 --> 00:38:08,133
if there is change in the position of Empress

528
00:38:08,174 --> 00:38:13,050
use it to protect the Empress

529
00:38:13,096 --> 00:38:17,461
yes, Nubi go get it

530
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,100
Nubi go get it

531
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,400
Emperor and the Noble Consort Xi leave.

532
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,500
Escort the Emperor.

533
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,700
Just then when I was with you,

534
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:22,314
Yunli and Yuying

535
00:39:22,397 --> 00:39:25,502
Yunxi and Yurao

536
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:28,863
we are three couples made by heaven.

537
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:33,343
Sister Yurao is extremely grateful to Emperor

538
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:38,143
having you, Zhen like to fulfill Yurao's wish

539
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,300
Emperor! Emperor!

540
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,143
stop

541
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,000
Emperor!

542
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,628
Dowager niangniang

543
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,309
Dowager niangniang is not good
