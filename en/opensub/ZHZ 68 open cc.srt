1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Episode 68

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,900
You can go rest up a bit.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,600
I still have matters to tend to.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,100
I'll see you tonight.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,100
When the king comes you have to go?

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,500
I still have petitions to review.

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,600
Then the king has to come at night

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,200
Okay.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,400
King, please watch your steps

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,100
Baojuan, Baojuan!

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,100
Xiao Zu Xiao Zu, What's wrong?

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
HURRY, call the doctor!

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,600
GUARDS! CALL THE DOCTOR

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,900
Consort Li is alright?

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,200
Palace Yanxi's people have their lips sealed.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,700
Nothing can be detected from them.

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,300
They all say that Consort Li didn't sleep well, causing pregnancy complications.

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,700
No worries.

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,800
Hopefully.

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,200
Greetings Noble Consort Xi.

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,000
I greet Noble Consort Xi.

22
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,700
This flower sure is pretty.

23
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,300
These are the lilies that just bloomed this year.

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,100
I personally picked out a few to give it to you

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,800
This flower is called fox-tailed lily.

26
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,500
You see that the petal is pink and curling.

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,800
Just like a fox tail, right?

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,300
It also has a fresh smell and is easy to raise.

29
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,400
Wherever the palace has water, wherever this flower thrives.

30
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,500
Did you give some to Consort Li?

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,000
I haven't...

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,600
Just now Palace Yanxi said

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,200
that Consort Li hasn't slept well.

34
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,900
Lilies are the best at easing one's mind.

35
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,900
Tell the floral department to deliver some to her.

36
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes, I understand.

37
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,300
Niang Niang

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Mistress has a steady pulse.

39
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,100
There are no big troubles.

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,200
I will now go prepare some smoked herbal pouches.

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,200
We trouble you then.

42
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,600
How did you have complications so suddenly?

43
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,300
Empress Niang Niang, I have been upset these days.

44
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,200
I feel as if I can't bore this child

45
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,900
I'm sure you can't

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,100
Your body has long been ill-fitting for childbirth.

47
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,500
If it wasn't for saving your father and securing the palace's position,

48
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,900
I wouldn't have forced you to become pregnant.

49
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,800
Yes, I know

50
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,200
If it wasn't for Niang Niang's arrangements,

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,500
my father wouldn't have been safe and sound now.

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,500
But you still haven't done the most important thing

53
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,800
Noble Consort Xi said that she's sick and refused to see me.

54
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,900
For now, I can't blame my miscarriage

55
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,400
on her.

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,500
Most importantly, the things she has sent here

57
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,400
are all inspected by the doctor so there's no room for error.

58
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,600
You must wait for opportunities.

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,700
I've already asked the doctor

60
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,100
Your child will be kept for six months at most

61
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,100
If it doesn't get miscarried by then,

62
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,800
then even your own life will be in danger!

63
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,200
There's still a little more than one month.

64
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,600
You think of something.

65
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,100
I understand.

66
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
The imperial doctor has said,

67
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:09,626
you must not move impulsively at this time.

68
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,700
Also you can't sleep with the Emperor

69
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,800
or you may really miscarry the child. Understand?

70
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,100
Yes

71
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,500
Drink up the stabilizing medicine.

72
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,700
Later Imperial Doctor Xu will prepare smoked herbs for you.

73
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,900
Remember, this matter must not be spread.

74
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
If anyone asks, say that the fetus is well.

75
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,400
Yes.

76
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,200
Niang Niang leave carefully.

77
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,500
Mistress likes peach blossoms. Why did you deliver lilies?

78
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,700
The workers of the floral house heard

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,800
that lilies has a calming effect on the heart.

80
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,000
So they asked me to cut these

81
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,400
and put them in Niang Niang's palace.

82
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,900
Imperial doctor Xu, <br> Here.

83
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,600
Please inspect for me

84
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,400
whether the lily has any issues.

85
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,300
Alright.

86
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,500
Niang Niang, the lily does have a calming effect.

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,300
Niang Niang has been suffering from insomnia.

88
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,700
Having some lilies in your room will produce benefits.

89
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,300
Then put them there.

90
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,300
Yes.

91
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,700
Were the lilies delivered?

92
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,800
They've been delivered.

93
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,600
The floral house has been sending them everyday.

94
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,700
The imperial doctor has inspected the buds

95
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,000
and said that they have no harm.

96
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,100
Consort Li also likes them.

97
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
A few days from now will be Consort Li's birthday.

98
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:46,149
The Emperor will definitely go to her.

99
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,100
We don't need to worry then.

100
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,800
Niang Niang don't need to have any worries.

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,900
You can just hide and fake sickness.

102
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,400
If I don't avoid her,

103
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,100
if she gets into some accident,

104
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,600
she will definitely frame me.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,600
I can't bear that.

106
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,300
You write so well.

107
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,100
When I was learning calligraphy,

108
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,700
I didn't write as well.

109
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
I saw Fourth Brother practicing calligraphy for a whole day.

110
00:05:14,763 --> 00:05:16,695
His hand was shaking yet he refused to stop.

111
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,600
Your fourth brother is the most hard-working.

112
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,300
Yes, even the Emperor said,

113
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,300
the fourth prince was enlightened the latest,

114
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
but his talent is the highest.

115
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:26,390
He's also willing to endure harships.

116
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,000
This is all thanks to your teaching.

117
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,600
I heard that the court is pushing more and more

118
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,200
for the eldest being the crown prince.

119
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,200
Third Prince is the eldest,

120
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,100
and is also raised by the Empress.

121
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,000
Naturally he's the most promoted.

122
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,200
But looking at Third Prince's intelligence,

123
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,200
it will be hard for him to even defend a city,

124
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,700
let alone become a good emperor.

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,300
So the Emperor

126
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
has set all his hopes on the Sixth Prince.

127
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,200
The Sixth Prince is still young. What can he accomplish?

128
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,200
It's still Longyue who's the best.

129
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
She learns everything immediately.

130
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,600
The silk bamboo sound has been heard all day.

131
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,000
Palace Yanxi is indeed lively.

132
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,200
Celebrating your birthday while pregnancy is naturally the happiest.

133
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
Today, this flower has been prepared personally by me.

134
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,000
Is it pretty?

135
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,500
It's pretty.

136
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,300
Niang Niang's craft is better than those floral house servants by hundred times.

137
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,800
Then have the floral house send them to Palace Yanxi.

138
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,800
to add to all the happiness.

139
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,300
After delivering them, some water should be sprinkled on the petals.

140
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,600
Then the colors will stay longer.

141
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,400
Emperor,

142
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,500
After a whole day of feasting,

143
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,200
I can finally quiet down

144
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,500
and talk to you.

145
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,400
and drink some wine.

146
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,500
So the Emperor doesn't like liveliness?

147
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,200
I like it.

148
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,200
But I like you more.

149
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,400
It seems to be a bit bigger.

150
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,100
Five months.

151
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,900
Five more months until it's born.

152
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,000
It must be as cute and nice as you.

153
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,100
You smell so nice.

154
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,600
Emperor, the imperial doctor said

155
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,800
that you can't be intimate with me.

156
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,900
It's already five months.

157
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,400
Nothing serious would happen.

158
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,000
Imperial Doctor Xu said that you are well.

159
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,700
But the imperial doctor also said

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,600
You don't like me staying here?

161
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,500
Two Niang Niang, something bad has happened.

162
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,400
Consort Li has miscarried.

163
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,300
It's just a miscarriage, why are you so panicked?

164
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,400
My reply,

165
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,200
Consort Li miscarried because she and the Emperor...

166
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,000
Emperor himself was also shocked.

167
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,300
Hanzhu, watch Longyue for me.

168
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,400
Noble Consort Xi and I will go to Palace Yanxi.

169
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,900
Yes.

170
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,300
Mistress,

171
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,200
Why is there so much blood?

172
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,100
Yeah, what will we do?

173
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,100
Emperor, Empress,

174
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,300
Hurry and rise. Go see Consort Xi.

175
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,100
Yes.

176
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,800
Mistress, Mistress!

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,700
Take them out, take them out.

178
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,700
Mistress, you must endure it.

179
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,300
My child!

180
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,100
How is Consort Li?

181
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,600
Niang Niang has produced so much blood.

182
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,300
This child definitely can't be saved.

183
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,400
While pregnant, passionate love-making is not allowed.

184
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,500
Why did Niang Niang and the Emperor lack such self-control?

185
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,600
Besides this Niang Niang,

186
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,000
Mistress, what will we do?

187
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,800
So much blood.

188
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,900
How is it?

189
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,900
There was a lot of blood.

190
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,600
But the imperial doctor said

191
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,600
the child definitely can't be kept.

192
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,600
How did she go from being well to this?

193
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,600
It's all my fault.

194
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,200
It's all me.

195
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,600
The child is gone.

196
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,900
Huan Huan

197
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
I have lost another child.

198
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,900
I thought that after so many years,

199
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,800
you have produced a child for me,

200
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,600
Mei'er also bore a child.

201
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,800
I thought that the heavens has already forgiven me.

202
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,800
But,

203
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,800
but Rong'er's child,

204
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,000
was lost because of me.

205
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,500
It was me.

206
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:32,825
It's ok, it's ok.

207
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,200
There have been so many princes and princesses born safely.

208
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,400
How could the heavens not have forgiven you?

209
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,700
Today's matter was only an accident.

210
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,100
It wasn't an accident.

211
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,400
I shouldn't have been drinking with Rong'er so late at night.

212
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,500
After drinking some wine,

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,700
I was with her alone.

214
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,300
I clearly knew she...

215
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,500
Actually

216
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,800
Consort Li was already pregnant for five months.

217
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,800
Didn't the imperial doctor say the pregnancy was well?

218
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,400
Even if,

219
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,800
Even if the Emperor favors Consort Li,

220
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,100
you should have controlled yourself.

221
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,300
I also know that.

222
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,000
But whenever I'm alone with Consort Li,

223
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
I've been unable to control myself.

224
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,600
A couple of times before because I remembered her pregnancy I was fine.

225
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,000
But I think today may have been the alcohol.

226
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
The Emperor hasn't calmed down his heart yet.

227
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,300
How about you rest at my place today?

228
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,900
Imperial Doctor will take care of Consort Li well.

229
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,900
Consort Li's matter is not as urgent as politics.

230
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,100
Emperor should go rest at Empress's palace.

231
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,400
Yes.

232
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Consort Li's game was a loss.

233
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,100
Consort Li's pregnancy was suspicious.

234
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,200
The imperial doctor clearly told her not to get intimate with the Emperor.

235
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,900
Why did she do it then?

236
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,000
The one in the wrong is the Emperor.

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,400
But why was the Emperor so lacking in self-control?

238
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,400
According to my knowledge,

239
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,200
the Emperor doesn't reside in the Palace Yanxi often those past days.

240
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,600
He actually stayed more at Ning Pin's place.

241
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,700
Was it because Consort Li wanted to fight for favor?

242
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,200
Stupid!

243
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,300
But this matter,

244
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,000
I feel like Palace Yongshou

245
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,800
has had a hand in this.

246
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,900
Palace Yongshou has always claimed sickness.

247
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,200
It has removed itself cleanly from this matter.

248
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,400
Does Niang Niang want to investigate it?

249
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,700
No.

250
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,400
If we investigate,

251
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,300
we would know then that Consort Li

252
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,200
wasn't able to keep her child in the first place.

253
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,800
The relation between Imperial Doctor Xu and us will also be discovered.

254
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,400
By then we won't even have the Emperor's pity for Consort Li.

255
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,500
It would even implicate us.

256
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,600
Then we can only vaguely end this matter.

257
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,200
We weren't able to remove Noble Consort Xi with this pregnancy.

258
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,600
Such a pity!

259
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,700
Don't worry, Niang Niang.

260
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,400
Without Consort Li, there are still plenty of new ones.

261
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,700
If Consort Li was smart enough,

262
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
she would know that a man's pity and sympathy

263
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
would be enough to stabilize her position.

264
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Emperor, eat a piece of dessert.

265
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,200
I don't have the appetite.

266
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,100
Ever since Consort Li had the accident,

267
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,300
you have been depressed.

268
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,900
You must also take care of your own body.

269
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,600
How is Consort Li?

270
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,900
Still the same.

271
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,200
She refuses to see anyone and doesn't like to talk.

272
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,800
Emperor,

273
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,400
Lingering Kang has come to greet you.

274
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Let her in.

275
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,600
Yes.

276
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,100
I greet the Emperor and Noble Consort Xi.

277
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,600
Rise.

278
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,600
I heard that Emperor does have good appetite lately.

279
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,400
So I've especially asked someone to make some peach blossom pastry.

280
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,000
Put it here.

281
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,000
Your hair accessory...

282
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,900
Heartless wench!

283
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,900
The palace just lost a child,

284
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,000
Consort Li is still sick,

285
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,700
whom are you so dressed up for?

286
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,400
Emperor forgive me! I...

287
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Take your thing and leave!

288
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,000
Emperor calm yourself.

289
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,500
I have, in many circumstances with no alternative,

290
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
done many things against my will.

291
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,700
All for Qing's peace,

292
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,300
I have killed many.

293
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,000
But this time

294
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,500
Mistress, you have woken.

295
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,600
Imperial doctor said your body is weak and shouldn't be in a breeze.

296
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,400
Really?

297
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,600
I don't feel it.

298
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Mistress,

299
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,500
Emperor heavily rewarded your father.

300
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Is the Emperor comforting or compensating?

301
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,100
Compensating that I can never bear a child from now on?

302
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Actually,

303
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,400
this child was never meant to live from the start.

304
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,600
I also knew that this day would come.

305
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,200
No matter if it's me,

306
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,700
or the child.

307
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,000
We are just pawns used by others.

308
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,000
We wouldn't be protected forever.

309
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,900
Mistress, don't be so sad.

310
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,600
The Emperor actually cares for you still.

311
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,700
Baojuan, do you know?

312
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,100
I feel so tired.

313
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,000
I've never been this tired.

314
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,200
But I know,

315
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,100
when I'm well,

316
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,100
I would be manipulated by others again.

317
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,800
I would have to fight again.

318
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,800
But Baojuan,

319
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,700
I really feel like I'm exhausted to the bones.

320
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,000
I can't fight anymore.

321
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Mistress, you've gone mad with your sadness.

322
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,100
You may go.

323
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,600
Zhen Huan,

324
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,700
originally I was the one in the wrong.

325
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,600
Revenge wasn't sweet.

326
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,300
It was meant to be.

327
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,900
Empress Niang Niang,

328
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
smell the fragrance I prepared today.

329
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,600
How is it?

330
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,100
The fragrance is intricate and has a relaxing effect.

331
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,600
I just got this treasure

332
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,300
and wanted to share it with Niang Niang.

333
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,800
Talking about fragrances,

334
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,700
no one can rival Consort Li.

335
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,800
That's right.

336
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,400
Jixiang,

337
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,400
let Empress Niang Niang see it.

338
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,900
Yes.

339
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,900
Consort Li's Minglu fragrance really is a good thing.

340
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,600
It's as refreshing as flowers.

341
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,600
Such a good thing

342
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:05,138
really is a treasure.

343
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,500
If anyone in the palace has even a bit of this,

344
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,000
they will be able to keep the Emperor's heart.

345
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,300
What is this exactly?

346
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,500
Empress Niang Niang,

347
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,900
When men and women are together and aren't stimulated,

348
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,800
they can use fragrances.

349
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,000
Was this fragrance really found at Consort Li's place?

350
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,500
Empress Niang Niang knows

351
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,600
I have no reason to frame Consort Li.

352
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,400
Is this fragrance poisnous?

353
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,400
Not poisnous.

354
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,900
Perhaps Consort Li was being foolish for the moment

355
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,300
and just wanted to keep Emperor at her side.

356
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,000
That day when Consort Li miscarried, I've been suspicious.

357
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,700
The Emperor's alcohol tolerance is high.

358
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,100
How could he lose all his self-control after just a few cups?

359
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,400
He clearly knew she was pregnant.

360
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,300
Even if he wanted to sleep with her,

361
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,700
he wouldn't have been so brutish.

362
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,500
Why was he so lacking in judgment?

363
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
Consort Li also knew she was pregnant.

364
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,900
Why didn't she resist?

365
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,500
So I've sent people to investigate.

366
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,700
And they found, in the fragrance ashes Baojuan threw away that day,

367
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,400
this thing.

368
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,700
I saw Internal Affairs Department's records,

369
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,400
before Consort Li's birthday,

370
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,900
Emperor was either in his palace tending to the proposals

371
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,600
or staying at Ning Pin's place.

372
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,700
He went few times to Palace Yanxi.

373
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,200
Unless Consort Li,

374
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,900
in order to gain favor,

375
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,300
with her five months of pregnancy,

376
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,000
and stable condition,

377
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,200
decided to act so foolish?

378
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,700
Imperial noble consort,

379
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
perhaps there was some misunderstanding in this?

380
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,500
Consort Li, no matter how brave,

381
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,900
wouldn't take imperial descendants so lightly.

382
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,100
Did someone deliberately harm her?

383
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,400
Noble Consort Xi's guess is not without reason.

384
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,600
Jixiang, you say it.

385
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,100
Yes.

386
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,400
Under the order of Imperial Noble Consort, I investigated

387
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,400
and found in the backyard of Palace Yanxi

388
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,900
a half-empty fragrance pot.

389
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:11,989
The ashes contained this object.

390
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,700
After asking the imperial doctor to confirm it,

391
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,100
I've asked the servants of Palace Yanxi,

392
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,000
who all said that all the fragrance materials

393
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,800
are kept by Consort Li herself.

394
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,500
I've also secretly taken a peek when others weren't looking.

395
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,600
There were a few important boxes that weren't locked.

396
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,000
Without the key, they can't be opened.

397
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,000
Continue.

398
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,200
According to the imperial noble consort's orders,

399
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,100
I've taken all the boxes containing the fragrances.

400
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,200
Among them, there was one box

401
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,400
that contained the exact same contents as the one we saw just now.

402
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,700
And a couple locked boxes

403
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,400
were placed in high shelves.

404
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,400
I heard the palace maids say

405
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:48,806
that Consort Li doesn't plan to use them in the near future.

406
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,500
But don't know why she used them now.

407
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,200
Why else?

408
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,700
Using such a lowly trick to gain favor

409
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,200
and harmed even the imperial fetus.

410
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,200
Definitely evil.

411
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,900
Niang Niang don't worry. We are only searching the palace.

412
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,600
You are searching the palace like you're going to seal it.

413
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,300
I know that Palace Yongshou has been searched before.

414
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,200
Fengshui really does go around in circles.

415
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,700
Today it's come to me.

416
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,900
Fengshui really does go around in circles.

417
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,500
After the good days end,

418
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,500
the bad days come.

419
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,300
A day's good or bad

420
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,100
isn't just decided by a castrated person like you.

421
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,800
Gonggong, we found it.

422
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,600
A castrated person is still a person

423
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,900
and still say human words.

424
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,800
Whatever, Consort Li.

425
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,500
Come to the Palace of Resting Hearts now.

426
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Using such lowly things in the palace,

427
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,000
how does the Emperor think she should be punished?

428
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,100
I've already ordered a palace search.

429
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,700
After all, she just lost a child.

430
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,800
How about removing her title and downgrading her as a Promise?

431
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,100
I think

432
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,800
that Consort Li losing her child is already a lesson learned.

433
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,800
It's enough.

434
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,700
But daring to use such dirty objects to bewitch the emperor,

435
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,100
messing up the harem.

436
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,100
You must not go easy on her.

437
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,100
Though Consort Li is wrong in concocting strange fragrances,

438
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,000
she has lost her child

439
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,100
and cannot reproduce again.

440
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,300
This counts as a lesson learned.

441
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,600
Emperor should forgive her this time.

442
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,000
And Consort Li making fragrances

443
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,100
does have its benefits.

444
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
That year when my face was scratched by a cat,

445
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,200
Consort Li gave me this cream,

446
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,000
which healed me completely.

447
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,100
Now there's not even a sign of a scar.

448
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,000
Please remember her good from the past days,

449
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,100
and forgive her this time.

450
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,600
I remember when Noble Consort Xi was scratched by that cat,

451
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,800
it was your first time pregnant, right?

452
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,600
Yes.

453
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,400
Why does Imperial Noble Consort ask?

454
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,600
Emperor.

455
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,900
I've always been physically weak and had no fortune to reproduce.

456
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,000
What Imperial Noble Consort just said

457
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,000
I have just remembered it as well.

458
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,900
That year when she was healthy and strong,

459
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,300
even with Nian Shilan making things difficult for her,

460
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,900
how could she miscarry after kneeling for just half an hour?

461
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,200
Thinking back on it, don't you think it's strange?'

462
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,200
Even a healthy and strong body can't withstand harms done in the dark.

463
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,200
Where is Wei Lin?

464
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,800
He is outside.

465
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,900
He has been waiting to take your pulse.

466
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,500
Tell him to come in.

467
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,500
Summon Wei Lin!

468
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,000
I greet the Emperor.

469
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,600
Inspect this healing cream

470
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,500
to see if there's anything off.

471
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,100
Yes.

472
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,400
This object contains large amounts of musk.

473
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,700
If applied on the face daily,

474
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,500
miscarriage will occur within three months.

475
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,000
How is that possible?

476
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
It was Ling Zhong who killed my child.

477
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,200
That is correct.

478
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,200
The ointment is already dried up,

479
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,100
indicating that Niang Niang hasn't used it in a long time.

480
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,900
To remove the scarring, two boxes of this would be necessary.

481
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,000
If accumulated this way, miscarriage would be inevitable.

482
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,900
Emperor. Emperor.

483
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,300
Lingrong's heart is so cruel!

484
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,400
Playing such a cruel hand to one of her best friends!

485
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,400
And she even did it without any errors.

486
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Human hearts are unpredictable!

487
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Because of An Lingrong's palace maid's false report,

488
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,500
Shen Meizhuang became shocked and went into labor.

489
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Now we know this person has a scheming heart.

490
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,600
The palace maid's false reporting must have been under the order of An Lingrong.

491
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,500
It's a pity that Princess Jinghe lost her mother so young.

492
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,000
Whenever An Lingrog sees the princess,

493
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,600
I wonder how she feels.

494
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,500
Very good.

495
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,500
Very good.

496
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,200
The woman I spoiled for so many years doesn't deserve to be human.

497
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,000
Emperor,

498
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,500
I brought people to Consort Li's place

499
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,500
and searched some things.

500
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,800
Those musk have a rich aroma.

501
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,500
They're all extremely valuable.

502
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,100
Their intensity is unrivaled.

503
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,500
Nobody knows how many lives have been taken by those musks.

504
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,400
Throw it out quickly.

505
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,200
Emperor.

506
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,200
I brought Consort Li here

507
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,100
and is outside right now.

508
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,200
Consort Li,

509
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,800
the emperor has asked you to go in now.

510
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,300
I will never get to see

511
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,300
the beautiful sunshine again.

512
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,600
Nobel Consort Xi's child

513
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,500
Shen Meizhuang's death,

514
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,300
because of you.

515
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,000
Since I did it,

516
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,800
I knew there would be consequences.

517
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,600
Consort Li,

518
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,300
You've accompanied me for many years.

519
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,300
You've never disobeyed me.

520
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,900
Why...why are you so cruel?

521
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,300
I don't like the title Consort Li.

522
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,700
Consort Li (Li meaning a type of bird)

523
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,800
I'm merely a pet bird to you.

524
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,900
Emperor,

525
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,400
Have you ever liked me for just a little bit?

526
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,500
Your treatment of me,

527
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
and your treatment of a pet cat or dog.

528
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,200
Is there a difference?

529
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,700
As for cruelty,

530
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,900
in this deep palace,

531
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,400
who hasn't been cruel?

532
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,000
Did anyone order you to do this?

533
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,500
Do you have anything to rebuttal?

534
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,500
Everything is my fault.

535
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,400
Please pass your punishment.

536
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,000
Everyone has moments of cruelty.

537
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,700
Because in this palace,

538
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,100
everyone has moments they can't control.

539
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,200
But your cruelty

540
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,800
is already hundred times that of a normal person.

541
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,400
I won't let you die.

542
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,300
I will also keep your title of Consort Li.

543
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,400
Palace Yanxi will be your cold palace.

544
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,400
When your body is well,

545
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,500
I will have people spank your mouth daily

546
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,900
and have you kneel in front of Buddha daily

547
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,100
to repent for your sins.

548
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,100
With you as an example, no one will try the same thing again.

549
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,100
Su Peisheng.

550
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,100
I'm here.

551
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,600
Take her away.

552
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,800
Forbid her to step outside Palace Yanxi.

553
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,100
And allow no one to serve her.

554
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,900
All of the servants that have served her before

555
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,000
kill the close ones,

556
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
and sell the rest as slaves.

557
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,600
Ban them forevery from the capital.

558
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,400
I will see how she self-destructs.

559
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,400
Prevent people from killing her

560
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,700
in case they dirty their own hands.

561
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,800
This offering

562
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,900
is for my unborn first child.

563
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,000
The child's spirit in heaven can finally rest now.

564
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,700
Look at this petal's color,

565
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,400
it's exactly like that fragrant stimulant.

566
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,000
Yes,

567
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,700
Little Yunzi's accidental discovering of this fragrance

568
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,100
became the object that allowed us to destroy An Lingrong.

569
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,400
The fox-tailed lilies delivered by the floral house slaves daily,

570
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,700
who woud have thought that only the petals of that night

571
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,000
had some fragrance and water spprinkled on them.

572
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,300
An Lingrong is an A-class fragrancemaker.

573
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,900
So she also used fragrances to dig up her own grave.

574
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,900
Su Peisheng said

575
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,400
that he will take care of her well in Palace Yanxi.

576
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,600
Don't let her die.

577
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,100
Su Peisheng knows how to do things accordingly.

578
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,800
Niang Niang don't need to worry.

579
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,700
Emperor has already ordered to kill An Bihuai.

580
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,500
The execution day is in these two days.

581
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,100
Pick an appropriate time to tell him

582
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,800
He should grieve for his daughter at least.

583
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,400
Yes.

584
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,600
Niang Niang, Su Gong Gong is here.

585
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,800
Greetings to Noble Consort Xi.

586
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,200
Su Gong Gong,

587
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,800
Niang Niang, Consort Li said she wants to see you.

588
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,900
That's fine.

589
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,800
There are some matters I want to discuss with her in person.

590
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,500
Su Gong Gong, you must be discreet.

591
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,600
Don't startle anyone.

592
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,900
Don't worry, I'm at your service.

593
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,800
There's also another matter,

594
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,700
Consort Li said she wants to eat bitter almonds.

595
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,100
Emperor said

596
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,000
that clothing and food will still be provided.

597
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,800
She's still Consort Li.

598
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,100
Jiejie came.

599
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,500
Looking at me,

600
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,800
do you think I aged a lot?

601
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,000
Do I still look the same as before?

602
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,900
Meimei's appearance is still the same,

603
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,100
but the heart is not as pure as before.

604
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,200
If I was still that pure and innocent,

605
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,000
in this palace,

606
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,700
I would have died hundreds of times already.

607
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,500
Do you know who taught me embroidery?

608
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,600
It was my mother

609
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,200
My mother used to be an embroideress in Suzhou.

610
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,600
My father really liked her.

611
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,200
Back then,

612
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,000
my father was only a small businessman selling fragrances.

613
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,600
With my mother's money from embroidery,

614
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,800
she got him a small court position.

615
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,500
My mother killed her eyes while working for my father.

616
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
She was also not as beautiful as before

617
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,600
so my father married many concubines.

618
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,500
Though my mother was the wife,

619
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,800
but her beauty waas long gone

620
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,200
and she didn't have a scheming heart

621
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,300
so she was taken advantage of often.

622
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,700
As a result, in the end

623
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,800
my father refused to see her.

624
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,400
After entering the palace,

625
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,100
Consort Hua was so fierce

626
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,400
and Empress's network was so deep.

627
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,400
Even the palace maids dared to bully me.

628
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,100
I was very scared.

629
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,200
Every night I dreamed

630
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,400
that I became the same as my mother

631
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,400
Blinded eyes,

632
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,400
and humiliated by others.

633
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,900
Death better than life.

634
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,800
Everyone knows that life in the palace is difficult.

635
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,100
But no matter how hard life is,

636
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,100
how calculated it must be,

637
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,400
you shouldn't harm those around you.

638
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,700
Especially those who treat you like their sisters.

639
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,300
Before,

640
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,800
I also thought you genuinely treated me well.

641
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,000
You had so many things,

642
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,900
a high-class bearing,

643
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,100
a beautiful face,

644
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,700
and the Emperor's love.

645
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,900
But I, because of my low bearing

646
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
was often insulted by others.

647
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,800
And even because of your favor with the Emperor,

648
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,400
I had to endure humiliation from Consort Hua.

649
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,600
Later I understood

650
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,000
that your good to me

651
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,900
your care for me, your help for me,

652
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,200
was merely some charity food for beggars.

653
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,100
You wanted me to fight for favor in place of Shen Meizhuang.

654
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,300
So that I can stabilize your position in the palace.

655
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,600
Ever since entering the palace, we three relied on each other.

656
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,100
The things you didn't want to do, I wouldn't have forced you to.

657
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,900
That day when Meizhuang was under palace arrest,

658
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,100
if I didn't unite with you,

659
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,400
I would have become preys for everyone.

660
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,800
This bitter almond is delicious.

661
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,800
After staying in the palace for so long,

662
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,700
even bitter almonds become sweet.

663
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,600
Don't hold a grudge against me.

664
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,800
And say that I'm cruel.

665
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,700
In reality,

666
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,500
I'm just a bit unresigned.

667
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,600
I was unresigned to stay here soundlessly

668
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,900
and become someone else's stepping stone.

669
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,500
I was unresigned to live soundlessly.

670
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,600
I had to fight for my favor.

671
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,500
I had to hold a grudge against the empress, the emperor,

672
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,200
all those who treated me like pawns,

673
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,100
and all those who treated me like a toy.

674
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,800
When did I not know that the Empress wasn't sincerely helping me?

675
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,900
And how did I not know

676
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,100
that Emperor never loved me?

677
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,600
But in this harem,

678
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
there's no place for sincerity.

679
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,900
In the end,

680
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,000
I still hate you the most.

681
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,800
Because you have everything,

682
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,300
With the end nearing,

683
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,100
I have lost everything.

684
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,600
If you hadn't entirely gone back on your conscience,

685
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,100
think back to your past.

686
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,400
How many have you harmed?

687
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,600
I don't want to look back.

688
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,200
The palace's nights,

689
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,400
are so cold and so long.

690
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,100
How I endured every second,

691
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,400
I dare not to think about it.

692
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,000
No matter how cold,

693
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,200
you shouldn't use others' blood to warm yourself.

694
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,600
What warmth?

695
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,800
Jiejie,

696
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,200
you are already my eternal enemy.

697
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,900
Enemy?

698
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,100
I'm not going to hate you.

699
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,400
I also don't want to forgive you.

700
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,000
Because it's too undeserving.

701
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,600
I agree.

702
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,400
My whole life

703
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,900
has always been not worth it.

704
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,100
Empress,

705
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,300
kill the empress!

706
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,600
Sorry.

707
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,200
Your peaceful life,

708
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,700
was destroyed by me in the end.

709
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,300
This life,

710
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,200
this breath,

711
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,500
has never been controlled by me.

712
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,900
But today,

713
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,700
I can finally control it

714
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,200
and become its master for once.

715
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,400
This sunrise

716
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,600
is just like that day when we first entered the palace.

717
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,800
But the feelings are not like before.

718
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,900
Why did Niang Niang stay in there so long?

719
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,200
What did Consort Li say to you?

720
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,800
Nothing much.

721
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,800
She's truly pitiful.

722
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,300
Consort Li Niang Niang has died!
