1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,100
The weather is hot recentIy

2
00:00:08,656 --> 00:00:10,017
Your nanny said that

3
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:11,567
You study untiI midnight of everyday

4
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:15,758
AIthough it is good to be hardworkingYou have to take care of your heaIth

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,100
You asked peopIe to<br>send soup to me everyday

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,500
I didn't feeI tired

7
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:21,166
The soup

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,500
Is to remind you to have a rest

9
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:25,434
But not to study after drinking it

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,100
I have misunderstood you

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,400
Greeting, consort Xi 4th prince

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,000
It's Iate now Consort Ning

13
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,400
Why are you here aIone?

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,100
His Majesty wanted me to come

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,500
But 3rd prince is inside now

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,100
Eunuch Su said that

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,600
His Majesty is pissed off

18
00:00:39,995 --> 00:00:41,591
He asked me not to enter first

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,800
You can memorize

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,800
The poem of the previous emperor

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,100
But

22
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,276
You can't answer

23
00:00:55,606 --> 00:00:57,151
Why the previous emperor

24
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,821
Can easiIy ruIe the country

25
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:03,054
Didn't your teacher

26
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,700
TeII you about the

27
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:07,227
PoIicies of the previous emperor

28
00:01:07,504 --> 00:01:11,072
He did

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,000
Mother toId me to read it too

30
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,700
Your teacher and mother are hardworking

31
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:19,840
But you are Iazy

32
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:22,875
You went to schooI since 5 years oId

33
00:01:23,624 --> 00:01:25,224
It's been many years

34
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,794
Yet you didn't Iearn many things

35
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,100
I remember you can

36
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:35,153
Memorize the poIicies in two years ago

37
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,678
Now you actuaIIy forgot them aII

38
00:01:40,786 --> 00:01:42,137
LukiIy your teacher is patient

39
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:44,071
If I were him

40
00:01:45,074 --> 00:01:47,358
I wouId have died

41
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:49,094
PIease don't be angry

42
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,900
I don't want to be angry too

43
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,100
But I can't do it because of you

44
00:01:58,628 --> 00:01:59,869
You are my eIdest son

45
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:04,552
I don't hope you to do something big

46
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,500
I onIy want you

47
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,000
To be the roIe modeI of your brothers

48
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,300
So that I don't have to worry about them

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,500
But you did

50
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,800
So many useIess things

51
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:20,312
His Majesty is so angry

52
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:22,988
He is the ruIer

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,300
It is sure that he is<br>not as amiabIe as you are

54
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:29,574
You stiII don't have a son

55
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:31,894
When you have

56
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,300
a son in the future

57
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:35,081
More strict than His Majesty

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Oh 4th prince

59
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,100
I heard that you are hardworking

60
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,300
Do you know the things<br>that His Majesty mentioned

61
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,300
How can I hoId a candIe to 3rd brother

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,100
I studied Iater than he did

63
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,900
Consort Ning means I am stupid<br>by saying that I am hardworking

64
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,800
Because I need more times

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
Or The teacher wiII scoId me

66
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,100
Memorize this articIe within three days

67
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,600
Or you don't have to

68
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,100
come and see me anymore

69
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,000
Greeting, consort Xi<br>Greeting, consort Ning

71
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,416
His Majesty is pissed off

72
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,586
He might be harsh

73
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:24,938
Take it easy

74
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,300
They are father and son, anyway

75
00:03:27,863 --> 00:03:29,142
Everything wiII be fine after a few days

76

00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,476
I am not as smart as other peopIe are

85
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,500
Therefore I have to work harder

86
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:02,492
By studying everyday

87
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600

Your 6th brother is stiII young

115
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,000

ActuaIIy I don't reaIIy Iike it

So she made them into<br>foods and want me to eat

167
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:28,593
She is doing that for your own good

168
00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:31,272
You shouId foIIow her order

169
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:36,214
It seems Iike you don't reaIIy Iike kids

170
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,841
Kids are naughty

171
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:42,003
We don't have to bother<br>ourseIf arguing with them

172
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,741
And entertain them

173
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,100
I speciaIIy made this cIoths In order to meet you

174
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:50,434
But it is broken

175
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,100
AIright Meng-Yue Come

176
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,500
You Iike the pIum I'II give it to you

177
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,300
You Iove me the most<br>Eat it

178
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:09,515
Meng-Yue Let's go

179
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:15,692
The kids feeI weird

180
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,520
With our existence

181
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,000
It's windy<br>Consort Xi I am going back to get a change

182
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,800
Mother is gone<br>Consort Xi, pIease go<br>and Iook for her with me

183
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:33,858
Go with her

184
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:36,195
Then I wiII Ieave first

185
00:09:44,326 --> 00:09:45,803
She is here

186
00:09:46,257 --> 00:09:47,953
Why didn't you teII us

187
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,400
LuckiIy she didn't bIame on us

188
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,900
She wiII not do so<br>Now her mind is occupied<br>By the reputation of her famiIy

189
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,400
She won't think about us<br>You must be bored<br>Therefore you simpIy found<br>an excuse and Ieft there

190
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:07,944
Look at those girIs They are outstanding<br>But 3rd prince doesn't seem<br>to be interested in them

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,300
Yes<br>Meng-Yue 3rd prince Iooks unhappy

192
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,500
Go and get him here<br>Ask him to come and have a waIk

193
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,621
Hurry up

194
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,200
Don't you Iike those pretty sisters

195
00:10:36,832 --> 00:10:38,791
I don't Iike arrogant

196
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:40,791
And hypocriticaI women

197
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,300
So do I<br>What kind of girI do you Iike

198
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,400
Tender and quiet

199
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,000
Are you saying that I am taIkative

200
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,381
You are the most cute

201
00:10:56,153 --> 00:11:00,657
Why is the coIor of the fIower<br>Different from the coIor<br>when I saw it in the morning

202
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:02,963
The fIower

203
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:05,924
Is red in coIor in morning<br>And pink in coIor in evening

204
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:11,843
It is Iike the face of a beauty<br>They have a Iot of emotion

205
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:14,491
This Iady is beauty

206
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:16,498
Do you agree with me

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,800
Both of you are pretty

208
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,600
I don't deserve you to caII me as a sister

209
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:32,444
Princess I am Lady Ying

210
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,100
Lady Ying Why didn't I see you before

211
00:11:35,877 --> 00:11:37,153
This is

212
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:38,707
This is my 3rd brother

213
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:42,376
Greeting, 3rd prince

214
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:50,100
3rd brother, lady Ying is our mother too. You don't come often here, that's why you don't know her

215
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,500
Greeting lady Ying

216
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,200
Greeting 3rd brother, greeting lady Ying too. Greeting you two

217
00:11:59,557 --> 00:12:01,423
Lady Yin is appreciating the flowers alone

218
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,200
It looks like you're not very happy

219
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,500
I'm just missing my family

220
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,000
Even we met, we'll separate.

221
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,300
My birth mother has died.

222
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,400
Even if I want to see her, I can't.

223
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,300
Prince don't need to be sad.

224
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,515
Though your birth mother isn't here,

225
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,800
but no matter wherever or whenever, her heart will always remember you.

226
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,900
Before, whatever she did

227
00:12:29,176 --> 00:12:30,672
was also for the good of you.

228
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:33,501
Thanks for Ying Niang Niang's enlightenment.

229
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,700
Why don't you have anyone serving you?

230
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
What does it matter to have a servant around?

231
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,900
If the one with you doesn't understand you,

232
00:12:45,987 --> 00:12:48,737
it's a waste.

233
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:55,270
But sometimes I also feel, the more people present, the lonelier I feel.

234
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,353
You are right about this idea.

235
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:03,714
It's getting late. I shall bid goodbye now.

236
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,800
So having many people with you still makes you feel lonely.

237
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Only having someone who understands you by your side

238
00:13:20,229 --> 00:13:21,851
is real happiness.

239
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:25,033
Third brother, what are you mumbling about?

240
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,200
Nothing. Let's go.

241
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,400
In the palace, the imperial noble consort plays pipa the best.

242
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,800
Noble Consort Xi plays the qin the best.

243
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:05,032
As for zithers, you are number one.

244
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,300
I'm merely an amateur.

245
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:10,340
How can I be compared to the other Niang Niangs?

246
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:12,448
You have a quiet personality

247
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,400
and do not like to fight for favor. This naturally has its benefits.

248
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,000
Your Majesty,

249
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,700
Third Prince is here. <br> Let him in.

250
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:31,025
Then I shall leave first.

251
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,901
No need.

252
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:34,399
You are also his senior.

253
00:14:47,156 --> 00:14:48,070
Greetings to imperial father.

254
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:51,796
Why are you here at this hour?

255
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,032
Have you completed the lessons for today? <br> Yes, and I have read through all the teacher's lectures for today.

256
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,700
That's good.

257
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,600
I will test you on your lessons another day.

258
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:01,702
Imperial father,

259
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,400
I came today with a request about my schooling.

260
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:06,586
Say it.

261
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:11,187
Both imperial father and mother feel that I am grown up and should start a family.

262
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:14,442
But I feel that right now is a good time for studying

263
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,100
I don't want to involve myself in any relationships

264
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,600
so I don't want to marry and start a family yet.

265
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:22,712
Our original intention

266
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,100
was to have another person take care of you.

267
00:15:25,151 --> 00:15:27,361
But I have many servants to take care of me, which is enough.

268
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,600
If I have a wife, I will most likely be distracted.

269
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,900
I know that I am not especially gifted

270
00:15:33,138 --> 00:15:35,082
and can't share your burden

271
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:38,883
so I want to study well and let your mind rest in peace.

272
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:42,225
If that's what you think, then I feel at ease.

273
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,198
This was your imperial mother's wish anyways. I'm not worried.

274
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,002
Imperial father,

275
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,400
in the future I also want to

276
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:51,819
marry a virtuous and quiet wife.

277
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:52,870
Yes.

278
00:15:53,398 --> 00:15:55,076
Peace between the husband and wife is the most important.

279
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:58,472
You may leave now.

280
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,000
Ying Niang Niang's playing of the zither is like mountains breaking down delicately and hibiscus crying tears of dew.

281
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:10,439
I am in awe.

282
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,266
Thanks for Third Prince's compliment.

283
00:16:13,658 --> 00:16:18,238
You really have a good ear. This song "High Mountains Flowing Streams" is her best.

284
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,400
You can leave

285
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,000
Yes

286
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:30,911
Gugu can just send me here.

287
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,189
Gege (daughters of nobles), please wait a moment.

288
00:16:32,353 --> 00:16:33,867
What matter does Gugu have?

289
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,323
Though Gege can't become a wife for now,

290
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,607
Niang Niang's words do have reason.

291
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:45,800
How about we ignore titles and have you serve Third Prince as an escort concubine first? You can always be promoted later.

292
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:47,279
Even if aunt (Empress) was unlucky back then,

293
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:48,614
she was at least a secondary wife.

294
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,800
But now I can only be an escort concubine without titles.

295
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:54,202
Auntie really does care for me.

296
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,300
Gege shouldn't just look at the short term effects.

297
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,069
You should bear the humiliation for now.

298
00:16:58,786 --> 00:16:59,699
Bear the humiliation?

299
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,729
Isn't my humiliation now not big enough?

300
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,300
Third Prince doesn't like me and even the Emperor agreed not to have me as his wife.

301
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:10,447
Now I'm the laughingstock of the entire palace.

302
00:17:10,784 --> 00:17:11,729
Then what am I?

303
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,701
And now you want me to so shamelessly attach to him.

304
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:16,864
Please forward this to auntie: thank you for your great love.

305
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:19,549
Gege leave carefully.

306
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:29,513
Niang Niang,

307
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,400
she's been sent out?

308
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,800
Yes.

309
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,600
Gege wasn't very happy.

310
00:17:34,894 --> 00:17:37,064
Did you say that it was my idea?

311
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,745
Gege has a high temperament and does not want to comply.

312
00:17:43,098 --> 00:17:45,825
She's too young Have no patient.

313
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,661
What's the matter with being an escort concubine or a wife?

314
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:52,386
When Third Prince inherits the throne,

315
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,704
I will become the Empress Dowager.

316
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,800
I'll be the one to decide whom the emperor chooses as his empress.

317
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:03,360
The empress's seat must be someone from the Wulanala clan.

318
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:05,168
Niang Niang is right.

319
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:07,626
Gege is still young and can't think this far.

320
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:14,457
It's a pity that she can't. Wulanala clan still has plenty of good girls.

321
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:16,917
When the new crop grows up,

322
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:19,152
she won't even be considered anymore.

323
00:18:19,593 --> 00:18:21,072
That's Gege not realizing her fortune.

324
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:25,551
She even talked about how you were a secondary wife back then and started complaining.

325
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:26,871
Fine then.

326
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:30,831
If she likes complaining about how I was a secondary wife back then,

327
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,830
and if she refuses to be the escort concubine,

328
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:39,952
then I shall promote her for once. I'll have her realize that being the secondary wife

329
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:43,113
of some other princes is worse than being the escort concubine of Third Prince.

330
00:18:43,403 --> 00:18:44,733
Your meaning is?

331
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:47,126
Fourth Prince is already sixteen.

332
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:49,508
I will ask the Emperor for mercy

333
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:52,547
and have Qingying

334
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:54,144
become the secondary wife of Fourth Prince.

335
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:56,448
Wouldn't this be too good for Fourth Prince?

336
00:18:56,527 --> 00:19:01,378
Too good? We are giving the Fourth Prince someone the Third Prince doesn't like.

337
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:07,500
Besides, Noble Consort Xi and I have bad blood. With this new daughter-in-law, I wonder who is blocking who?

338
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,200
Niang Niang is indeed right. But I have one matter to ask,

339
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:16,804
court officials are electing candidates for the crown prince. Why did Niang Niang let them mention Sixth Prince?

340
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:24,100
The Emperor is suspicious and is most afriad of the court collaborating with the harem to manipulate politics.

341
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,800
We must constantly give Emperor a reminder.

342
00:19:35,962 --> 00:19:37,157
These few years,

343
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,900
I keep feeling that my body is not what it used to be.

344
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:42,243
Empress is saying

345
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,000
to have a marriage arranged for Hongshi.

346
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,000
The court also keeps mentioning the election of a crown prince.

347
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:52,950
You don't know how annoyed I am by this.

348
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,700
Do all these ministers feel that I am getting too old

349
00:19:57,181 --> 00:19:59,715
so they're rushing to elect a crown prince?

350
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:02,768
You are still rich in your years and strong in body. No need to appoint a crown prince yet.

351
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Third Prince, no matter how good, still needs experience.

352
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,400
The court ministers are just

353
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,000
worried that you are overworked

354
00:20:09,118 --> 00:20:10,437
and want someone to share your burdens.

355
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,034
Even if I was to choose a crown prince,

356
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,700
I would have to wait for our Sixth Prince.

357
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,305
Some ministers

358
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,239
are patient when they shouldn't be or impatient when they don't need to be.

359
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,300
Now that I think about it,

360
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:28,753
Fourth Prince is already sixteen.

361
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,200
When you mention Third Prince's marriage,

362
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:33,556
I think of Fourth Prince.

363
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:34,667
Emperor,

364
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,300
you must not pick favorites.

365
00:20:36,437 --> 00:20:37,327
Your words are

366
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,200
the same as Empress's.

367
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,500
Empress said that she has a niece named Qingying

368
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,197
whom she wants to marry to Hongli.

369
00:20:45,197 --> 00:20:46,574
Empress is picking favorites!

370
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:49,926
Why does our Fourth Prince need to be stuck with someone Third Prince doesn't like?

371
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,400
You already said yourself that you've chosen Chahaer Administrator's daughter, Fucha.

372
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:56,925
You must not go back on your words.

373
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,800
I know that you also like Fucha,

374
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,500
Fucha is younger than Hongli by a year but is reliable.

375
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,100
But the Empress says that Qingying only wants to be a secondary wife.

376
00:21:09,222 --> 00:21:10,544
Since Empress is this humble,

377
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,000
I also don't have much to say.

378
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,474
Wulanala clan is a noble clan.

379
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:17,798
I just fear that Empress's niece won't feel right with us.

380
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,700
If the Empress is willing,

381
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:23,297
I should at least save her face this once.

382
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:24,817
That's fine.

383
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,100
After all, our Fourth Prince is the one getting the bargain.

384
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,900
Today's weather is good.

385
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:35,080
Walking out here is good. If we stay inside all day,

386
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,600
we would grow moldy.

387
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,200
It's already September.

388
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:42,079
Did you ask people in your palace to pick some switchgrass?

389
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,500
Why so?

390
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:49,300
Switchgrass and stay are homophones. It's also September (homophones with longevity), so it means to have the Emperor stay long.

391
00:21:50,964 --> 00:21:55,358
I don't believe this. <br> You are in favor right now so of course you don't believe these.

392
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,500
Isn't that the Prince?

393
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,400
Prince Guojun?

394
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,500
It's been a while since I've since Prince.

395
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,100
Since you married and started a family,

396
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:19,997
you can't be as free as before.

397
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:27,000
Now that you have one wife on each side, trapping you. Even if you have wings, it would be hard for you to escape.

398
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,000
Noble Consort Jing is still this humorous.

399
00:22:34,964 --> 00:22:36,961
Long time no see, how is Noble Consort Xi?

400
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,300
Thanks for the Prince's concern. My body is well.

401
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,500
So why is Prince here in the palace today?

402
00:22:49,047 --> 00:22:51,883
I've come to greet the Emperor after a long time of absence.

403
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,500
It's windy so Prince should wear this cape.

404
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,900
No.

405
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,300
We are married, why do you have to act so formal?

406
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,100
This must be Wife Xian.

407
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,100
I am Prince Guojun's Secondary Wife Meng Jingxian.

408
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,800
I hereby greet Noble Consort Xi,

409
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,600
wishing you longevity, happiness, fortune, and peace.

410
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,500
Please

411
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,400
hurry and get up.

412
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,700
You were sick on the day of your wedding so this is our first meeting.

413
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:30,818
We are all family

414
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:32,961
so no need for formalities.

415
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,708
I should've come greet Noble Consort Xi sooner, but my body was always unwell.

416
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,829
So today I came with Prince

417
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:44,773
to greet the Emperor and ask forgiveness of all the Niang Niangs.

418
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:48,342
The Emperor and I both were worried for your health.

419
00:23:49,212 --> 00:23:52,387
Why wasn't Yuyin here today also?

420
00:23:52,961 --> 00:23:54,037
She really has no rules.

421
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,500
Since Wife Xian is serving the Prince along with Yuyin,

422
00:23:57,947 --> 00:24:00,779
please teacher her well for me when you have freetime.

423
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,300
Today the farm is reporting the harvest for this quarter and Yuyin is tending to that so she couldn't come.

424
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:09,364
Yuyin Meimei is good at tending to domestic affairs.

425
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,419
Unlike me,

426
00:24:11,454 --> 00:24:13,023
with my ill body

427
00:24:13,681 --> 00:24:15,381
I can only trouble others.

428
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,500
You are overthinking it.

429
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,100
I heard that you are well-versed in poetry, how can that be a burden?

430
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,000
Jingxian,

431
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:28,795
don't overthink it.

432
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,900
Yuyin Meimei is Niang Niang's godsister.

433
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:36,816
If Niang Niang doesn't mind my abstruseness,

434
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,900
you can also treat me like your sister.

435
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:43,385
I am not worthy of your compliments.

436
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,900
It's getting late.

437
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,100
Let's not have the Emperor wait.

438
00:24:52,396 --> 00:24:59,751
Prince Guojun's treatment towards Wife Xian is indeed intimate and no less than your treatment towards her godsister.

439
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,600
It seems like the two wives by your side are sharing your love equally.

440
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,939
Prince Guojun, you are quite passionate.

441
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,600
Farewell.

442
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,000
As soon as you came, Niang Niang arrived.

443
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,000
It's so rare for Meimei to visit here.

444
00:25:33,229 --> 00:25:35,505
Do you usually have this many people serving you?

445
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,600
If there's nothing to tend to, have them leave for now.

446
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,500
The imperial garden is windy. I was afraid that your wind would get cold.

447
00:25:46,843 --> 00:25:48,478
Drink some warm tea.

448
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,000
You saw?

449
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,100
Wife Xian's infatuation I have long heard of.

450
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,236
It's better to see something for yourself.

451
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,900
Where was Meimei hiding and watching this drama unfold?

452
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:01,675
Being a human is hard.

453
00:26:02,275 --> 00:26:04,383
You have to act wherever you are.

454
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,400
And this palace is filled with good dramas in every corner.

455
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:12,342
So you think that Wife Xian was merely acting?

456
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,700
Some things you think it's false,

457
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:17,599
but they were actually genuine.

458
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:21,321
Niang Niang only saw it once and you are already upset.

459
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,600
I wonder how Wife Xian's infatuation

460
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,600
looks to Wife Yu, who has to endure it daily.

461
00:26:28,468 --> 00:26:30,516
Yuyin isn't that type of person.

462
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,700
Don't underestimate a woman's jealousy.

463
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,400
Since their marriage,

464
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,883
the Prince has only brought Wife Yu with him to the palace.

465
00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:43,316
But now, with Wife Xian's conditions bettering,

466
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:49,840
I'm only afraid that in the midst of Wife Yu's busy domestic management, she would have to taste loneliness.

467
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:50,955
No way.

468
00:26:51,258 --> 00:26:55,159
After all they are equal in position.

469
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,000
It's exactly because they're equal in position and power

470
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:01,026
that if the Prince treats one a bit nicer,

471
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:04,626
the other, if she has a narrow heart,

472
00:27:04,908 --> 00:27:06,758
then there would be quarrels.

473
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:10,277
The reason the Prince married Yuyin,

474
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:14,114
I think Niang Niang knows more than I do.

475
00:27:15,448 --> 00:27:19,038
That image, how did it fall out so easily?

476
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:23,005
The Prince isn't that type of uncautious person

477
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,300
The wood has already become the boat.

478
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:31,510
Ning Pin should understand that the thing grasped in hand is the most reliable.

479
00:27:32,713 --> 00:27:36,018
But you and I have lost an opportunity like Yuyin's long ago.

480
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:40,319
Though she was selfish, she had no harm intended.

481
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
If not self-centered, the heavens would bring curse.

482
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:49,872
Just hope that Wife Yu won't kill off her conscience.

483
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,000
I'll go back and rest. There are plenty of good acts later on in this palace.

484
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,200
I can't miss them.

485
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,941
I'll bid goodbye now.

486
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,500
Does Niang Niang know why all the consorts in the palace like desserts?

487
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Perhaps their hearts are bitter so they can only compensate with desserts.

488
00:28:20,518 --> 00:28:22,055
Then Niang Niang should eat some more.

489
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,912
In reality Ning Pin's words don't need to be taken seriously.

490
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:27,605
That's true.

491
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,900
After a few days Yuyin will come to the palace to greet.

492
00:28:33,364 --> 00:28:35,554
You should prepare some of her favorite food.

493
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,870
Alright.

494
00:28:47,908 --> 00:28:48,597
Precious,

495
00:28:49,548 --> 00:28:50,431
Third Prince.

496
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:53,808
You should call me Ying Niang Niang.

497
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,637
It's only you and I here.

498
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,500
Greetings to Ying Niang Niang.

499
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,800
You can leave now.

500
00:29:09,796 --> 00:29:11,943
What does Third Prince want to say?

501
00:29:11,943 --> 00:29:16,036
I converted that song you played on the zither into a singing song.

502
00:29:16,116 --> 00:29:17,674
Did you hear it?

503
00:29:18,684 --> 00:29:20,204
Third Prince don't say this.

504
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,100
If the Emperor knows that you are not doing proper things, he would rebuke you again.

505
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,300
I knew that only you understand and care for me in this palace.

506
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,985
Third Prince, what are you doing? I'm your stepmother!

507
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,500
I know that you treat me well! I don't care about titles and positions!

508
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,000
Please leave Third Prince!

509
00:29:40,835 --> 00:29:42,303
Am I really not on the level of my father?

510
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:44,855
My heart has you! Imperial father is already old!

511
00:29:55,352 --> 00:29:58,552
What happened today? Precious Ying was so anxious

512
00:29:58,905 --> 00:30:01,382
and Third Prince acts like he lost his soul

513
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,900
and saw a ghost or something.

514
00:30:03,306 --> 00:30:05,276
Both are at the peak of youth,

515
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
perhaps...

516
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:11,151
No wonder, the last few days when the opera was arranging the music,

517
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,000
I heard someone singing Precious Ying's "High Mountains Flowing Streams".

518
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,500
It seemed that Third Prince found someone who arranged it according to Precious Ying's zither music.

519
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,400
You are saying,

520
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,200
Right now Third Prince is the Empress's adopted son

521
00:30:23,478 --> 00:30:25,594
and the Empress is his rightful mother.

522
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,900
This is an important matter.

523
00:30:29,074 --> 00:30:30,995
Have someone follow them.

524
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,074
Yes.

525
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,500
You've already stayed here for a few days.

526
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:38,556
If you don't go back,

527
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,300
the Prince will worry.

528
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,500
The Prince Lord treats Meng Jingxian more closely than he treats me.

529
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,558
The people in the household has also taken sides.

530
00:30:47,636 --> 00:30:49,345
It's meaningless to go back.

531
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,000
Niang Niang,

532
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,100
Prince Guojun household's Wife Xian has come.

533
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,400
She said that she has come to greet you.

534
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,800
Speaking of the devil,

535
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,200
so it seems that gossiping is not good.

536
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:07,277
Elder sister, I don't want to see her. I've already seen enough of her infatuation with the Prince.

537
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,100
I wanted to come here and avoid her for a while, but I can't even do that!

538
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:14,722
As long as your eyes don't see her, it's fine. Go hide over there.

539
00:31:14,758 --> 00:31:15,943
I'll take care of her.

540
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,100
Niang Niang <br> Let her in.

541
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,353
Greetings to Noble Consort Xi

542
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:36,669
You may rise.

543
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,100
Sit.

544
00:31:40,077 --> 00:31:41,470
Why do you have free time to

545
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:43,206
come here and visit?

546
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,948
I just went to greet the Emperor

547
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,100
so I came to see you also.

548
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,300
Right,

549
00:31:50,498 --> 00:31:53,029
I heard that Yuyin Meimei is also living her for a few days.

550
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,962
But I don't see her.

551
00:31:56,722 --> 00:31:57,854
How unfortunate,

552
00:31:58,392 --> 00:31:59,950
she went to Noble Consort Jing

553
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,229
and said that she was going to make clothes for Princess Longyue.

554
00:32:04,157 --> 00:32:06,276
Yuyin Meimei really likes children.

555
00:32:07,336 --> 00:32:08,876
Drink some tea.

556
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,726
Niang Niang's tea is so aromatic,

557
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:21,363
but I shouldn't drink tea right now.

558
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,600
Or else I would want to taste some of this tea.

559
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,600
Why? Is your body not well?

560
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:32,385
The imperial doctor said that I am already pregnant one month.

561
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,300
I'm not stable yet so I can't drink tea for now.

562
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,700
This servant girl is so clumsy.

563
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,700
She can't even put a hanger back properly and startled you.

564
00:32:56,913 --> 00:33:01,054
What's wrong with you? Why can't you even put back a hanger properly?

565
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:04,965
Don't cry, the two Niang Niang are still outside. You will disturb them.

566
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,200
Then this really is good news.

567
00:33:17,534 --> 00:33:22,032
This servant girl doesn't know anything because of my lack of discpline. Please forgive us.

568
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:25,345
New palace maids are always a bit clumsy.

569
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,600
It's fortunate that our household has Yuyin. If it were me, how could I manage all the servant?

570
00:33:32,489 --> 00:33:37,509
No matter how able Yuyin is, she still isn't on par with your achievement of bearing a child.

571
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,700
Ever since I married into the Prince's household,

572
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:46,831
I've always heard how the Prince loved Yuyin Meimei for many years

573
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:49,119
before marrying her.

574
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,700
Yuyin has great feelings for the Prince, and so do you.

575
00:33:57,467 --> 00:34:01,831
The Prince only has sympathy for me.

576
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:08,708
Only I know myself how this child came about.

577
00:34:09,387 --> 00:34:14,515
Because only with a child would I be able to retain his heart.

578
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:21,357
But these days I find that Yuyin is also trying as hard as I am.

579
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,500
If the Prince really was, as rumored,

580
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,400
to be this in love with Yuyin Meimei, why would she need to try this hard?

581
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:32,316
Since you are already married into his household,

582
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,477
I'll tell you something that I have realized over my years of experience in the palace.

583
00:34:37,307 --> 00:34:39,989
Suspicion creates hidden demons.

584
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:43,113
Some things, the more you think about it, the easier conflicts will arise out of it.

585
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,200
Those who don't worry are the smart ones.

586
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:51,262
Hopefully.

587
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,800
But I really can't understand the reason behind all this.

588
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I already said, Wife Xian is worrying too much because of your pregnancy.

589
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,100
Since I am one besides the Prince in bed,

590
00:35:03,653 --> 00:35:06,489
there are many things that the one in bed knows

591
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,600
but outsiders can't see.

592
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,900
Between couples, this is normal.

593
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,300
I shall bid goodbye now.

594
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:37,617
Meng Jingxian is too smart.

595
00:35:38,277 --> 00:35:41,603
Her suspicion will sooner ruin the Prince.

596
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,600
She loves the Prince deeply and will place his benefits first.

597
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,900
But now that she has his child,

598
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,300
what place do I have in this house?

599
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,200
Meng Jingxian's child is the Prince's child both by name and by blood.

600
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,217
You are his mother in name.

601
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:04,162
Naturally, there is a place for you.

602
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,900
You are Niuhulu clan's second miss,

603
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,700
Prince Guojun's secondary wife. You must be virtuous.

604
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:20,086
Since I love the Prince, I will naturally not mistreat his child.

605
00:36:22,646 --> 00:36:24,001
Elder sister,

606
00:36:25,048 --> 00:36:27,423
my heart is bitter though.

607
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,500
Things of the past are all not important. What's important is now.

608
00:36:36,534 --> 00:36:41,902
The Emperor likes Meng Jingxian and this is the first child born of Prince Guojun's household.

609
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,200
You must take care of her well and have no accidents.

610
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:54,204
I desire to know the reigning. My long life would never decline.

611
00:36:57,418 --> 00:36:58,914
I desire to know the reigning.

612
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,100
My long life would never decline.

613
00:37:03,525 --> 00:37:08,155
Third Prince, I've heard you reciting this poem for many days now.

614
00:37:09,481 --> 00:37:10,698
Little Lezi,

615
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,300
am I not good?

616
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,200
Good, how are you not good? You are the heaven's proud son. <br> What good is being the heaven's child?

617
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,200
The one who really cares for me is only her.

618
00:37:24,925 --> 00:37:26,798
Who?

619
00:37:28,353 --> 00:37:33,918
I have stomach-ful of words I want to tell her, but I don't know how.

620
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,400
If you can't say it, then write it.

621
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:41,355
You are indeed smart.

622
00:38:06,596 --> 00:38:09,675
What did Imperial Mother summon you to say?

623
00:38:10,446 --> 00:38:12,496
Imperial mother said that I am of age

624
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
and that imperial father will arrange a marriage for me.

625
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,178
Fucha is a good child. My mind is at ease.

626
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,900
I believe mother's taste.

627
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:26,600
But I am still young, I just want a wife. But imperial mother still wants me to have Wulanala as my secondary wife.

628
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,300
Does Mother know, that Wulanala-

629
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,000
I know it all.

630
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,500
If the Empress wants you to marry, then marry her.

631
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:37,157
Don't become her enemy over small things like these.

632
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,900
But giving someone Third Prince doesn't want to me,

633
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,400
You are welcoming the one Third Prince doesn't want. This shows your tolerance.

634
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,800
His caprice has fulfilled you.

635
00:38:51,189 --> 00:38:56,269
She's just a secondary wife. You just have to feed her at home,

636
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,200
no one's forcing you to treat her with mutual feelings.

637
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,428
Yes.

638
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:03,267
If you really don't like Qingying,

639
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,800
I've already found someone. Gao, who's taking care of you, is caring and virtuous.

640
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,548
I also know that you like her.

641
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:16,977
After a few years, I will ask your imperial father to have her marry you as your secondary wife as well.

642
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:20,517
Yes. Mother is planning for me

643
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,900
so I know to look at everything long-term. I will not disappoint you.

644
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,600
That's good then.

645
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,300
Greetings to Niang Niang.

646
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:29,502
Please rise Su Gong Gong.

647
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:32,416
Emperor is asking Niang Niang to go to Palace of Resting Soul.

648
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:34,382
I will go immediately.

649
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,900
Greetings to the Emperor and the Empress.
