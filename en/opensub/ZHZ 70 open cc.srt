1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,004
you had dared to ask

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,115
The people that your sister chose

3
00:00:10,115 --> 00:00:12,454
She did something shameless

4
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:14,532
Who is shameless?

5
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:21,223
-What letter? <br>-It's like this

6
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:26,885
yesterday I had Ruyi to the royal kitchen to fetch some evening snack, and she ran into Xiaolezi who served Third A Ge

7
00:00:26,923 --> 00:00:30,409
sneaking on the long street. --- Third A Ge has been careful

8
00:00:30,434 --> 00:00:33,885
he is not that kind of person

9
00:00:33,927 --> 00:00:39,325
be careful is probably on surface. Chenqie beg the forgiveness of Niangniang

10
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:42,223
Niangniang is not good at educate your son

11
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:44,891
Third A Ge is young, and doesn't know a lot of things

12
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:46,603
must be seduced by a slut woman

13
00:00:46,644 --> 00:00:50,692
Huangshang, Chenqie didn't do it, didn't do it

14
00:00:50,721 --> 00:00:53,019
the person was chosen by the 17th Prince

15
00:00:53,093 --> 00:00:55,438
what's good about this slut maid

16
00:00:55,524 --> 00:00:59,810
Chenqie thought that Third A Ge is innocent in the involvement of the thing

17
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:03,841
but both physical evidence and eyewitness are here, the letter is the handwriting of Third A Ge

18
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:05,977
that must be that slut seduced him first

19
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:10,525
stop, don't argue more. --- Huangshang, don't wrong your own son!

20
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:15,152
Huangshang, Chenqie didn't seduce Third A Ge

21
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:18,210
you behaved improper, and seduced the royal son

22
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:20,364
Zhen award you an ending

23
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:23,282
I didn't do it, Huangshang

24
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:26,782
you had talked about what happened, and Zhen don't want to hear more

25
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:28,523
Su Peisheng,

26
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:31,531
take her down, and give her a white cloth

27
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:39,947
Huangshang, I'm wronged, Huangshang

28
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:42,212
stop

29
00:01:48,038 --> 00:01:50,797
Hongshi has kneeing at Fengxiang Palace for most of the night

30
00:01:50,823 --> 00:01:53,423
this thing is stopped here

31
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:56,838
Zhen don't want to here one gossip in the harem

32
00:01:56,913 --> 00:02:02,226
you withdraw, Zhen have something to ask Xi Guifei

33
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:15,784
Ying Guiren was picked by Yu Fujin

34
00:02:19,495 --> 00:02:24,077
whether someone told Ying Guiren to seduce my son for aiming at the crown?

35
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:26,892
why did Huangshang ask the question in this way?

36
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:35,806
Hongshi is the oldest, the struggle of whether set the older or younger as the heir is nonstop

37
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:40,551
destroying Hongshi's reputation is destroying Zhen's reputation

38
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:45,100
Yuyin would not dare absolutely, Huangshang

39
00:02:46,777 --> 00:02:49,427
she wouldn't dare, how about the 17th Prince?

40
00:02:49,442 --> 00:02:50,824
Chenqie dare to vouch for him

41
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:52,584
you are based on what?

42
00:02:54,112 --> 00:03:00,222
everyone in this palace has been through the turmoil of the nine princes fighting for the crown under the late Emperor

43
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:04,576
the longing of the royal sons to the crown is fierce

44
00:03:06,615 --> 00:03:11,122
the 17th Prince was one of the candidates the late Emperor considered

45
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:16,066
Huangshang is wise, Gui Junwant won't dare

46
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,870
Zhen are afraid that he won't dare to do anything to Zhen

47
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:22,922
so he let Yu Fujin

48
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:25,369
to put ideas on my son

49
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:29,548
Guo Junwant has been loyal to Huangshang all these years

50
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:34,458
loyal, who can dig up his heart to take a look?

51
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:46,751
even you and Jing Guifei thought that Zhen wronged Ying Guiren

52
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,551
Zhen have to protect the reputation of royal family

53
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:52,891
protect my son, and

54
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,427
not let anyone have an opportunity

55
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:59,058
Ying Guiren was wronged

56
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:03,193
for Qing dynasty, wronged one doesn't count

57
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:10,056
since Yuyin is your adopted sister, you have to recuse yourself from this case

58
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:15,949
a lot of things happened in the harem, you are probably tired

59
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:19,858
let Empress deal with the things, or

60
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,425
Jing Guifei can help

61
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:24,301
Huangshang put it this way

62
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,464
do Huangshang suspect Chenqie?

63
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:32,807
Empress is right. You have a royal son

64
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:35,562
you can't be helped not involved in this

65
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:33,323
these two slaps, one for you dared to go fater your royal father's woman

66
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:37,862
one for you dared to go after the Emperor's woman

67
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:41,941
Huang A Ma, it's all Erchen's fault

68
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:44,383
beg Huang A Ma's forgiveness

69
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:48,933
Zhen, of course, have to forgive you, not only because you are my eldest son

70
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:51,785
but because you are the descendent of Aixinjuelo

71
00:05:51,824 --> 00:05:54,592
can't lose face for the royal family

72
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:56,851
Erchen know I did wrong

73
00:05:56,882 --> 00:06:01,005
this wrong someone is taken for you

74
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:04,305
Zhen has executed Ying Guiren

75
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,785
she was innocent, of course, it was your fault

76
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:13,554
but you are my son

77
00:06:13,578 --> 00:06:18,548
Zhen would not for a woman not to protect you

78
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,465
it was me who killed her

79
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:26,632
it was you who killed her

80
00:06:26,664 --> 00:06:29,796
you don't know how high the sky is, how thick the earth, and you don't know the basic ethics and feudal order

81
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:34,537
Huang A Ma

82
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:37,377
stay here and repent your errors. if you do wrong again

83
00:06:37,415 --> 00:06:39,941
Zhen can't protect you anymore

84
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:02,981
Sister

85
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:08,518
sister's place is so quiet that flower falling can be heard

86
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,066
it's rare that Sister's palace be this quiet

87
00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:19,268
a person in the harem won't be favored for life

88
00:07:19,298 --> 00:07:23,346
you won't be afraid if you see through it. losing favor

89
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:27,714
if you think the day is hare, it is hard

90
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:31,257
if you are calm and fearless, the day is calm and fearless

91
00:07:31,257 --> 00:07:36,627
everything is in your heart, has nothing to do with anything else

92
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:42,627
when have time, go with me to burn an incense for Ying Guiren

93
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:45,084
alright

94
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:50,346
I'm to be blamed for this. original thought was to use this to against Empress

95
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:55,627
didn't think by pushing too hard that hurt you and Ying Guiren

96
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:03,436
Ying Guiren wronged, but Guo Junwant is under suspicion for no reason, that's really wrong

97
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:07,420
I never thought it through. Huangshang never likes Third A Ge

98
00:08:07,507 --> 00:08:10,668
but he's on Third A Ge's side on this

99
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,713
and dealt a heavy hand on Ying Guiren and killed her

100
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:17,993
let Empress fight back and on the top of us

101
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:22,085
Huangshang can't lose face, and would protect royal family for certain

102
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:25,070
even his own son is not good

103
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:30,532
he is still his own son; furthermore, this is related to setting up heir

104
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:33,065
Huangshang naturally is more suspicious

105
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:37,998
I made a few kinds of dessert you like

106
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,833
I have no appetite

107
00:08:42,426 --> 00:08:43,921
how come all of sudden you have no appetite?

108
00:08:43,921 --> 00:08:46,067
maybe ate too much in the past

109
00:08:47,753 --> 00:08:50,636
Jinxi, make a bowl of sour plum soup

110
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:54,713
this sour soup

111
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:59,148
haven't had it for a while, and eager to have

112
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:02,753
it's good that you want to eat; it is lucky

113
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:10,400
are you...?

114
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:19,493
you are really lucky. with this child, all your problems you face now will be solved

115
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:25,157
I'll go to tell Huangshang to relieve my regret of hurting you

116
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:32,451
my situation is not difficult to deal with. I worry about Yuyin and Guo Junwang

117
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,296
how is niangniang lately?

118
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:43,436
the doctor said that Niangniang's digestion is not good, so she looks tired

119
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:46,257
Niangniang feels wronged

120
00:09:46,383 --> 00:09:48,747
this can't be blamed on her

121
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:51,916
no her fault. mine

122
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,602
Nucai won't dare

123
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,706
there was a reason that Zhen asked her the way the other day

124
00:09:59,951 --> 00:10:04,583
Eertai and Maqi argued

125
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:08,262
Zhen heard the argument back and forth, and it was about setting up the heir

126
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:11,387
inside and outside the Harem

127
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:14,110
don't know how many people

128
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:16,670
laying their eyes on this dragon chair

129
00:10:16,705 --> 00:10:21,719
if setting the heir publically, no one would have a peace any longer

130
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:26,093
Zhen have to find a good way to prepare if something happens

131
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:32,402
Huangshang is correct. --- Xi Guifei is pregnant now

132
00:10:32,492 --> 00:10:38,544
Zhen don't want her feeling been wronged any longer. --- it is kind of strange,

133
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:43,333
several things recently, how come they were all against Xi Guifei?

134
00:10:43,378 --> 00:10:46,182
seems strange

135
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,589
it is not that Zhen don't know

136
00:10:50,594 --> 00:10:55,765
it looks calm on surface

137
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,007
a tangle of rotten dirt inside, in fact

138
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:06,182
Zhen thought about to clean it up but it is about women's stuff, and didn't seem worth it

139
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:11,088
secondly, Cunyuan's feeling exists

140
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:16,426
I let it go many times

141
00:11:18,306 --> 00:11:22,426
it is okay if it is only about the harem

142
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:27,189
Zhen worry that

143
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:31,308
the Harem and the court is connected, and calculated together

144
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:36,609
Zhen have to be careful

145
00:11:39,984 --> 00:11:43,590
you send Zhen's dessert to Yongshou Palace

146
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:47,223
let Xi Guifei know that Zhen care about her

147
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:49,552
Nucai go to do it now

148
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:45,509
today is the 15th, a big day,huangshang pays respect with incense, our Qing will be in prospers and the people in peace

149
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:56,286
Zhen haven't held Six A Ge for a long time

150
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:05,349
Six A Ge is taller, Huangshang truly cares

151
00:13:05,402 --> 00:13:09,199
Six A Ge should grow taller and faster for Huangshang

152
00:13:09,217 --> 00:13:12,095
Zhen care about A Ges and Princesses

153
00:13:12,143 --> 00:13:15,306
and care about you

154
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:20,708
it is getting hotter day by day, don't eat raw and cold food, and

155
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:25,782
don't face wind with sweat. --- thanks for Emperor's concern

156
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:32,102
Zhen heard Xi Guifei coughed a few times, and felt concerned

157
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:37,933
Xi Guifei works hard. if you can't help her

158
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:42,259
and trouble her more instead, that would make

159
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,307
Zhen concern more

160
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:49,549
there are more people in the Harem

161
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:52,139
it is unavoidable there are more gossips

162
00:13:54,835 --> 00:14:00,923
relieve some maids from both Han Junqi and Meng Junqi

163
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:05,114
have maids from Man Junqi to serve in rotation

164
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:10,651
yes, only the people serving Huangshang don't need to be cut

165
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,564
what Zhen dislike most is servants talktive

166
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:21,309
throw out those that like to make trouble first

167
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:29,510
now Zhungeer clan is watching us like tiger watches its prey

168
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:36,113
it means something for the front even it won't save much money in the Harem

169
00:14:36,153 --> 00:14:41,213
you look out for yourselves

170
00:14:43,535 --> 00:14:46,870
we remember Huangshang's instruction

171
00:14:50,162 --> 00:14:55,686
I heard there are cuts in the Harem

172
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,443
this is Emperor embarrass Empress

173
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:03,230
what Huangshang thinks is most difficult to guess

174
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:07,660
it is hot now; it seems that you move around less

175
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,609
feel tired everyday, don't have much of spirit

176
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:17,355
I feel strange for this pregnancy, feel more like vomiting, and feel more unhappy

177
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:23,751
I didn't feel like this when I was pregnant with Longyue. --- in my opinion

178
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:30,088
have Wei Lin take a look. though you were pregnant before, let's play on the safe side

179
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:37,925
Jing Guifei is right. when Cunyuan Empress was pregnant, she felt a lot of discomfort

180
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:43,090
that woman gives birth is like go to the gate of Hell and come back

181
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:48,482
Cunyuan Empress was cared with such attention, yet ended up with the death of both mother and child

182
00:15:48,552 --> 00:15:55,794
children in the harem are difficult to be born and raised; you hurt yourself recently, and you'd better rest well now

183
00:15:55,906 --> 00:15:58,422
I'm a one that know how to steal rest, but still feel discomfort

184
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:19,116
the Empress killed the Empress

185
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:24,932
the Empress killed the Empress?

186
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:30,559
what did you say? even if you hate the Empress

187
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,715
you can't speak it loud

188
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:38,186
qjickly, tale princes and princesses away

189
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,751
you just said who killed whom?

190
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,894
the Empress killed the Empress. --- Empress?

191
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,348
what did you know?

192
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:09,401
it is not that I spoke some nonsense; this was the last sentence Lingrong said before she died

193
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:15,659
I thought she hated the Empress so much that she wanted me to kill the Empress for her

194
00:17:18,197 --> 00:17:23,000
for her, if she hated so much, she could do it herself

195
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:25,998
no need to ask you before her death

196
00:17:26,036 --> 00:17:34,198
I never thought about the sentence carefully until something Lingxi said that made me think about the key of the sentence

197
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:38,240
maybe there is another meaning

198
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,468
you seem have guessed the meaning long time ago

199
00:17:49,229 --> 00:17:58,026
at the time, Emperor was still prince, Yihiu was ordinary woman so she was titled Ce Fujin and would be Fujin if she gave birth

200
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:06,525
of a son until Cunyuan Empress was called to the house to accompany the pregnant sister, and

201
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,755
and met Emperor who fell in love with her in the first sight

202
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:15,624
begged the mother to make her as Fujin

203
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:20,110
Emperor insisted upon it and Dowager couldn't deny his desire

204
00:18:20,218 --> 00:18:24,778
Huangshang never saw Cunyuang Empress before that? --- never

205
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:35,027
since Huangshang and Dowager insisted, the only thing Yihiu could say was that older sister came to the house should be Fujin

206
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:39,448
Huangshang and Dowager were relieved

207
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:46,492
no long, Yihiu gave birth of a son; but the son wasn't healthy before birth, and died before he was three years old

208
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:51,520
then Cunyuan Empress was pregnant

209
00:18:51,592 --> 00:18:58,324
Cunyuan was the favorite of Emperor. after her pregnancy, Emperor said to Yihiu

210
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:05,992
you're good at medicine, and are blood sister of Cunyuan, having her serve Cunyuan and looking at the prescriptions with doctors

211
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:09,952
after the pregnancy Cunyuan had so much discomforts

212
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:15,274
she had so much pain at the birth, and born a dead baby and died herself after

213
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:20,771
before she died she said to Huangshang that don't shift your anger to the doctors

214
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:25,672
and take good care of her only younger sister Yihiu

215
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:30,068
Cunyuan had treated everyone kindly in the House since she came; yet

216
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:32,287
yet heaven was not kind to her

217
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:39,833
even that child I had taken a peek

218
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,301
there were several black spots on that child

219
00:19:43,387 --> 00:19:46,132
and had no breath once he was born

220
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:50,876
black spots? why did he have black spots?

221
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:54,118
did Huangshang know?

222
00:19:54,204 --> 00:19:58,462
he did. the doctor said that it was because she was alarmed in pregnancy and not sufficient blood and Qi

223
00:20:03,366 --> 00:20:08,485
because of the clan,Dowager was unwilling to have emperor to marry someone else, thus

224
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:11,855
Emperor agreed to put Yihiu as Fujin

225
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:15,310
you all know what happened after that

226
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:21,043
Yihiu cared extremely for her Fujin's position;

227
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:27,002
it was taken away suddenly by someone, didn't she have hatred toward her?

228
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:33,397
exactly. but we don't have evidence

229
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:39,993
after Cunyuan Empress's pregnancy, she served her closely

230
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:43,972
if we can bribe the eunuchs and maids of Empress,

231
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:47,830
maybe that is a way

232
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:56,543
take her power, take her favor, and lost her son, if she did it, she killed the Cunyuan Empress and her son

233
00:20:58,711 --> 00:21:01,545
but we have no evidence. there must have somewhere

234
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:07,312
An Lingrong with Empress for very long, she thought everything carefully

235
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:13,745
she must've seen something; otherwise she wouldn't have said something like this

236
00:21:16,228 --> 00:21:19,414
it could be that we are too paranoid

237
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:30,404
I like you hate her so much; but if we couldn't crash her in one blow

238
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,503
we have to endure whatever insults

239
00:21:39,654 --> 00:21:44,378
why are you here?

240
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,515
alright. we'll go back soon

241
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:00,615
we have to think more carefully, no one can afford careless

242
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,027
what happened, mother?

243
00:22:12,017 --> 00:22:17,754
mother saw your Xi Niangniang suffers so much with the pregnancy

244
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:22,238
can't eat well and sleep well, feels sick

245
00:22:22,352 --> 00:22:25,957
I saw that other niangniangs are like this when they are pregnant

246
00:22:28,684 --> 00:22:30,806
Longyue, do you know

247
00:22:30,845 --> 00:22:34,376
when your Xi Niangniang was pregnant with you, she was suffered a lot

248
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:38,414
now the life is just getting better, and she got pregnant again

249
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,888
mother feel sad for her

250
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,917
then I will greet Xi Niangniang in the evening

251
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:51,988
good. Xi Niangniang will be happy when she sees Longyue

252
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:58,446
I also want Mother happy. Huang A Ma is with Xi Niangniang, I will be with Mother

253
00:23:02,108 --> 00:23:12,774
Longyue is good. yet the more favors Xi Niangniang hets, the more harm could Xi Niangniang get; I want Longyue promise me

254
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:19,116
no matter when, you have to protect Xi Niangniang, not let Royal mother bullies her

255
00:23:19,205 --> 00:23:23,496
Mother said this many times and I remember

256
00:23:38,682 --> 00:23:44,599
what's the problem, doctor? she threw out whatever she ate, and didn't sleep well

257
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:52,888
don't be angry, Niangniang, my skill is not sufficient; if have Doctor Wen here, the baby could be saved

258
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:13,733
Yongshou Palace has asked Wen Shichu back

259
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:17,353
is there something with Xi Guifei's fetus?

260
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:24,443
there is no leak from Yongshou Palace, and I can't get anything. I asked the doctor and they said not a big problem now

261
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:30,902
Wen has be back that shows how much she cares about this fetus

262
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:35,192
March 18 is the birthday of the late Emperor. have you prepared? --- Huangshang is very filial

263
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:41,634
have ordered masters to read scriptures for 7 days and 7 nights, and hand copy the scriptures

264
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:44,203
and burn the scriptures on the day

265
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:48,766
Huangshang is a filial son, and sons of Huangshang are naturally filial

266
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:52,208
is the arrangement for Third A Ge ready?

267
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:56,446
according to Niangniang's instruction, Third A Ge has wrote a poem to Huangshang

268
00:24:56,609 --> 00:25:00,278
with so many days' preparation, Huangshang must be very happy

269
00:25:00,325 --> 00:25:04,408
the filial devotion of the princes are shown only in daily greetings

270
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:08,626
on the birthday of the late Emperor, Huangshang feels more culture and admiration, and would be moved more easily

271
00:25:08,703 --> 00:25:13,939
, Third A Ge will be fine if he has done some preparation, right?

272
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:19,981
Third A Ge's style is not above others; remember to have masters to offer advices

273
00:25:19,981 --> 00:25:24,563
Master Wang is a learned confusion scholar, Huangshang chose him for Third A Ge

274
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:27,602
that shows Huangshang has a lot of expectations for Third A Ge

275
00:25:27,657 --> 00:25:33,521
hope so. Third A Ge is the oldest son of Huangshang, it is unavoidable that he has lots of expectations

276
00:25:33,647 --> 00:25:38,632
only that the death of Ying Guiren would affect Third A Ge

277
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:44,818
Bengong will think of a way so that important ministers in the court will speak for Third A Ge

278
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:49,164
when he gets support from the court, Huangshang would feel ease to put him up as heir

279
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:52,053
everything is fine with Niangniang here

280
00:25:58,418 --> 00:26:00,755
Doctor Wen is here

281
00:26:10,163 --> 00:26:13,990
why you look so pale?

282
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,779
I wouldn't want to bother you if it is not that I couldn't find a way

283
00:26:45,893 --> 00:26:51,642
I believe Wei Lin has tried his best

284
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:58,254
from your pulse, Wei Lin discovered early that Niangniang is weaker than others

285
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:05,114
so he used Huangqi and Baizhu, gentle herbs, to nurture you

286
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,169
it's pity. --- what

287
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:13,842
what Niangniang was pregnant first, Niangniang was anxious and sad

288
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:17,433
plus the timing of the pregnancy,

289
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:23,148
the deficit from two previous births was not made up, it was not a good time for another pregnancy

290
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,587
no matter how hard we try, the fetus can be kept for a while but can't be saved

291
00:27:30,994 --> 00:27:33,974
tell me a truth,

292
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:38,201
how long can I keep this child?

293
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:43,771
Niangniang is pregnant for four months; this child

294
00:27:43,832 --> 00:27:47,068
even I and Wei Lin try our best

295
00:27:47,116 --> 00:27:50,361
he can't be kept for more than five months

296
00:27:50,412 --> 00:27:53,866
five months?

297
00:27:57,354 --> 00:28:02,165
then our mother-son relationship

298
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:04,501
has only less than one month left

299
00:28:08,405 --> 00:28:15,045
your health is more important, Niangniang, you can have more child in future

300
00:28:15,157 --> 00:28:21,661
this, can't tell anyone

301
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:29,450
as long as you and Wei Lin try hard to keep this child, keep it as long as possible

302
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:37,472
my prescriptions after my pregnancy, Wei Lin normally makes two copies

303
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:41,552
one keeps at the hospital, one I have

304
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:51,802
furthermore you have to prepare in advance

305
00:28:51,913 --> 00:28:55,449
