1
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:04,259
Go.

2
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:09,143
My status is lowly.

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,495
I'm afraid of touching these auspicious objects.

4
00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:14,246
Us servants shouldn't follow the Empress into the room

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,336
We don't want to offend the Gods

6
00:00:19,713 --> 00:00:20,779
That's true.

7
00:00:21,273 --> 00:00:24,512
It's better to be more cautious regarding such matters.<br>GIve it to me.

8
00:00:31,477 --> 00:00:32,468
Niang Niang.

9
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:35,334
You haven't drunk your pregnancy medication.

10
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:40,048
When I sent it to you just now, you said it was too hot.<br>Now it's just warm.

11
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:41,636
If we leave it any longer, it'll turn cold.

12
00:01:17,654 --> 00:01:18,587
Your Majesty.

13
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,875
The Empress, the two Jiejies, and I will be out soon.

14
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:31,203
When Empress Niang Niang is virtuous, she really is virtuous.

15
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:34,000
In the past, she didn't like Imperial Concubine Xi.

16
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:37,576
But now she accommodates to her needs.

17
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:39,930
Don't second guess the Empress.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,500
I thank the Empress for fulfilling my wish

19
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,203
of personally tying the fortune pouch for me.

20
00:01:58,957 --> 00:02:01,812
I'm the Empress. <br>It's only right.

21
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,000
Logically, it's right, but emotionally speaking,

22
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,100
Empress must really hate me.

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,100
I gifted you the Childbirth Guanyin

24
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,100
in the hope that you would be at peace

25
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:21,312
and not become distracted. The most important thing right now

26
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:23,716
is to bear a child for the Emperor.

27
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:29,797
Whether or not I'll be able to give birth,<br>is all in the hands of the Empress,

28
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,402
not me.

29
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:34,248
What do you mean?

30
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:36,133
Isn't that the case?

31
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,700
According to Niang Niang's wishes, the child lives. Against Niang Niang's wishes, both the mother and the child are ruined.

32
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:43,784
For so many years,

33
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:47,053
Empress Niang Niang has used this method to rule the six palaces.

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,000
I really am afraid.

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,900
I won't be able to keep the child in by belly.

36
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:54,526
if I somehow anger Empress Niang Niang one day.

37
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,700
Presumptuous! You dare to slander me?

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,700
Slander?

39
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,000
Let go!

40
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:05,390
Do you dare to swear to the gods that you have never harmed any of the Imperial offspring?

41
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,313
That you have never harmed anyone in the harem,<br>that you have never harmed me?

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,700
I'm the mistress of the six palaces.

43
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:12,726
How can I swear at your whim?

44
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,154
Let go.

45
00:03:14,312 --> 00:03:16,384
You don't dare to, do you?

46
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:19,479
Why did Consort Qi die?

47
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:21,881
Why is Ning Pin infertile?

48
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:24,123
Precious Fucha's miscarriage,

49
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:27,469
and my unborn child that year.

50
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:30,041
You've done so many evil things.

51
00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:32,561
You yourself know clearly what you have done.

52
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,400
How did it turn out like this?

53
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:49,754
Niang Niang!

54
00:03:50,153 --> 00:03:51,957
What happened to Niang Niang?

55
00:03:54,637 --> 00:03:56,568
What happened to Niang Niang? <br> Summon the Imperial Doctor!

56
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:59,320
Niang Niang! Niang Niang!<br> Huan Huan!

57
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,200
Huan Huan! Summon the imperial doctor! <br> Yes! <br> Niang Niang!

58
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:03,238
Imperial Doctor! <br> Huan Huan!

59
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:05,114
Imperial Doctor! <br> Get someone!

60
00:04:05,354 --> 00:04:06,977
Get someone!

61
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:09,380
Hurry and summon the imperial doctor! <br> Niang Niang what happened?

62
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,352
Wake up Niang Niang!

63
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:23,310
Niang Niang,

64
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,152
reply to Emperor, Niang Niang is awake.

65
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:39,244
Noble Consort Xi, you have woken.

66
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,400
Noble Consort Xi, please suppress your sadness. You will still have children.

67
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:47,092
"You will still have children"?

68
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:51,284
Empress Niang Niang's simple words,

69
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:54,927
are you equating my child's life with that of a piece of grass?

70
00:04:56,882 --> 00:04:58,119
Empress,

71
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:01,473
No matter how much you hate me,

72
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:04,931
why did you have to harm my child?

73
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,568
Ridiculous! When did I harm your child?

74
00:05:10,284 --> 00:05:14,377
Emperor, Emperor.

75
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:17,783
My child is no more.

76
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,884
It wasn't because of my carelessness.

77
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:24,638
It was Empress Niang Niang.

78
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:27,862
She and I started an argument

79
00:05:28,648 --> 00:05:30,674
and she pushed me!

80
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,700
Emperor, Niang Niang's abdomen area

81
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,400
does have signs of heavy trauma.

82
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:43,438
The imperial doctors can also testify

83
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:46,109
that there must have been a person who strongly pushed Niang Niang.

84
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:48,873
Besides, the fetus has always been healthy.

85
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:51,325
I'm sure the Emperor had also often heard of the fetus's movements.

86
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:53,917
If it wasn't for an accident,

87
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:56,321
miscarriage definitely wouldn't have occurred!

88
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:02,296
Empress, at that moment in the palace,

89
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:04,975
you were the only one present with Noble Consort Xi!

90
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:06,512
Emperor!

91
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:15,071
You,

92
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:18,800
and you.

93
00:06:18,994 --> 00:06:21,551
At that time in front of the palace entrance,

94
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,489
did you guys see anything?

95
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,268
At that time I was talking with Imperial Noble Consort outside and didn't see anything.

96
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:29,080
But,

97
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:33,601
but imperial noble consort and I did

98
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:38,839
hear from inside the palace that Empress Niang Niang and Noble Consort Xi seemed to have started an argument.

99
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,367
Because they started a dispute, we dared not to intrude and intervene.

100
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,637
Though I did hear Noble Consort Xi saying words like "fear", "afraid", etc.

101
00:06:49,804 --> 00:06:53,442
Empress also told Noble Consort Xi to know her place and be content with what she has.

102
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,700
The rest, I didn't see anything.

103
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,500
But my eyes and the eyes of many others saw

104
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,800
when Noble Consort Xi got hurt and fainted, only you were by her side.

105
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,100
Emperor, Empress hates how I get all your favor and love

106
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,200
and always thinks that I have a non-respectful heart so she rebuked me.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,600
In her fury, she pushed me.

108
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,664
At that time Noble Consort Xi

109
00:07:26,891 --> 00:07:29,387
I had to struggle just to get her grasp off me

110
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,200
But I didn't push Noble Consort Xi

111
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:39,160
According to what you're saying, then Noble Consort Xi pushed herself?

112
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't understand either

113
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,600
Why would Noble Consort Xi have been unreasonable and disrespectful? She's normally so prudent and cautious

114
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,100
Even when taking her medicine, she never forgets to drink every bowl on time.

115
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,300
All these years, Noble Consort Xi has been nothing but polite to the Empress

116
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,000
Even if Noble Consort Xi said something to offend the Empress

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,100
the empress should have forgiven her

118
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,900
At least, the empress should remember that Noble Consort Xi is carrying the Emperor's child

119
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:11,806
You said that Noble Consort Xi was being unreasonable, so what did she say to offend you?

120
00:08:12,643 --> 00:08:16,516
At the time there it was only the two of us

121
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:19,433
I know that there is nothing I can say for you to believe me

122
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:25,676
The only way that I would be implicated in this is if someone is trying to set me up

123
00:08:26,193 --> 00:08:28,526
You may feel that there is nothing you can say to change my mind

124
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:32,120
But I cannot even understand why or how something like this could happen

125
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,207
There were only two of you in the room, and there was an argument

126
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:40,954
and you have always disliked Noble Consort Xi. I have seen all of these factors

127
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,314
Yet, Noble consort Xi has been constantly pleading for forgiveness and peace

128
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:46,724
She has been thinking in your shoes this whole time

129
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:51,895
I have no reason to harm Noble Consort Xi

130
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,700
All these years that I've managed the palace's affairs, have you ever seen me harm anyone?

131
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,800
Only you know the answer to that.

132
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,500
Emperor!

133
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,100
During the Tang Dynasty, in order to gain the emperor's affection

134
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,300
Consort Wu got rid of Empress Wang by murdering her own baby girl

135
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,100
and setting up Empress Wang for murder

136
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,000
My fate today is the same as the past Empress Wang

137
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,800
Emperor

138
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,500
From the empress's accusations, even my death would be nothing.

139
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,300
But my child,

140
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,200
my child didn't even get to open its eyes and look at the world

141
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,300
my child is so blameless

142
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,981
Long Yue, why are you crying?

143
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,100
I didn't see anything

144
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,400
I didn't see anything!

145
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,200
Come over here

146
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,493
What did you see? Tell your father.

147
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,800
Your dad is here, there is nothing to be afraid

148
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,200
Your Empress Mother is here too. Tell us what happened. Don't be afraid.

149
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:14,106
Tell me what happened

150
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,000
Empress Mother pushed Noble Consort Xi. She pushed her!

151
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,000
You're lying! You coached her!

152
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,100
Tell me! You coached her!

153
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,900
Or it was you!

154
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,200
Empress!

155
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,800
Emperor! I'm innocent

156
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,000
Everything happened so fast. How could I have know what was going to happen?

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,200
And then coach her?

158
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,600
She's only 6 years old

159
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,800
She can't even lie yet

160
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,600
Plus, Noble Consort Xi only just woke up

161
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,400
who could have coached her?

162
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,200
Emperor!

163
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,200
I'm just like Empress Wang; we're being set up!

164
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,200
I am not Emperor Tang

165
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,100
I am not easily fooled like him.

166
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,800
But you, you've always treated Noble Consort Xi as an enemy. You've been trying to get rid of her all this time

167
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,300
I swear upon my ancestors

168
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,500
I didn't do anything to harm Noble Consort Xi's fetus

169
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,300
This kind of swear

170
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,100
you may as well do in front of the Tai Hou's grave

171
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,000
You are cold and calculating

172
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,400
and have harmed royal children

173
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,300
From this day onward,

174
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,200
you are not allowed to leave your palace

175
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,400
Su Pei Sheng

176
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,500
take her away

177
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,900
Empress

178
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,100
Let's go

179
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,600
Forgive me for speaking out of place,

180
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,700
but is the matter about the Empress true?

181
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,300
You are an old counselor

182
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,400
You are allowed to ask

183
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,000
I have thoroughly investigated

184
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,800
It is irrefutably true

185
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,300
Emperor

186
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,500
Although the Empress is not as gracious and loving as the past Empress Chun Yuan

187
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,900
But she is not an evil doer

188
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,800
Regarding many matters in the past,

189
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
it's not that I wasn't suspicious.

190
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
I just didn't want to pursue it.

191
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,800
But regarding this matter,

192
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,500
the Empress has no way of denying it.

193
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,700
The Empress has been fine all along.<br>Why would she suddenly do this?

194
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
When one has too many desires, it is impossible to make all of them come true

195
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,100
She wanted too much

196
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
Being Empress wasn't enough.

197
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,300
She still wanted to be the legitimate Empress Dowager!

198
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
I put Third Prince under her care.

199
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,898
But that only made her have delusional ambitions, beyond her place

200
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:58,469
The emperor is wise

201
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,100
In the future, whoever takes the throne

202
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,400
the empress will always been the Empress Mother

203
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,400
But the one holding power would be changed. How could she willingly watch that happen?

204
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,200
Then how do you plan on punishing her?

205
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,100
I've recently heard that there are many rumors

206
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,400
that many other children have died in the hands of the Empress

207
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,000
But rumors are just that, rumors.

208
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:30,533
Just like the Empress can only be the Empress.

209
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,100
If the Empress is removed, it will create mass chaos

210
00:13:35,025 --> 00:13:36,835
I haven't thought that yet.

211
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:40,703
The position of the Empress must be stable in order for the country to be prosperous

212
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,600
I will have the Empress reflect upon her mistakes

213
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,000
and severely punish

214
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,200
Niang niang, drink some tea. Rest a little

215
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No matter how much I repent right now, I can't shake the guilt I feel towards my unborn child

216
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You had no choice

217
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,400
The child is gone

218
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,800
You were not fated to spend a long time with each other

219
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,200
Right now the most important thing is

220
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,700
Although the Emperor has put the Empress under house arrest, <br>he hasn't punished her.

221
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,800
The Empress is Third Prince's adopted mother, and the Dowager's relative.

222
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,900
You need to get rid of her roots and ties

223
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,600
that way, she will have no support and help

224
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,000
Mother. <br>The night is cold.

225
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,100
Don't keep kneeling at the expense of your health.

226
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,100
I've gotten someone to brew some bird's nest.

227
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,900
Get up and drink it.

228
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,900
Such a filial heart is hard to come by.

229
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,000
I know that you are upset over my yet-to-be-born brother, Mother.

230
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
I got some auspicious papers from Consort Fu

231
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,700
We should burn some for my unborn brother

232
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,400
so that he may rest in peace in heaven

233
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,200
You and Consort Fu have worked hard

234
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,700
You are sick, and I can't even help

235
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,700
I've been really worried

236
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,700
I know that you are filial.

237
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,200
How has Third Prince been lately?

238
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,115
I heard that Third Brother is begging Father regarding the Empress.

239
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,700
In the end, he got lectured by Father.

240
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,700
Third Prince was brought up by the Empress.

241
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,400
Now that the Empress is out of favor,

242
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,500
lessen your contact with him.

243
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,100
Yes.

244
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,800
The Third Prince relies on the Empress for support

245
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,700
They rely on each other

246
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,000
Naturally.

247
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,100
Everyday that the Empress is around,

248
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,762
Third Prince will have a chance to ascend the throne.

249
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,000
Everyday that Third Prince is around, <br>the Empress will have a source of support.

250
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,000
Yes. I understand.

251
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,800
Fourth Brother has always been the most hardworking.

252
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,500
Even after getting married, you don't let up.

253
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,400
How are you so free to be standing here today?

254
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,300
It's Eighth Uncle's birthday today. <br>I went to the dungeon to visit him.

255
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,500
You dared to visit Eighth Uncle?

256
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,100
Weren't you afraid of being seen by others?

257
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
If other's had asked, naturally I wouldn't say a thing.

258
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,300
But you're my Third Brother, <br>as your younger brother, I wouldn't hide it from you.

259
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:38,439
How is Eighth Uncle then?

260
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,400
What do you think? <br>He's under arrest, and he's better off dead.

261
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:47,091
Third Brother, there's something I've always wanted to say.

262
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,600
I don't know if it's appropriate, though.

263
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,100
We're brothers. There's no need to stand on ceremony. <br>Say it.

264
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:55,903
Due to matters regarding ascension, <br>Father had countless kin locked up.

265
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:57,941
This was the case with Eighth Uncle, Fourteenth Uncle...

266
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
These were all Father's closest kin.

267
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,500
If we can intercede on behalf of Eighth and Fourteenth Uncle,

268
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
and allow them to receive Father's mercy,

269
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,700
wouldn't that protect Father's reputation?

270
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,600
It will prevent people from a hundred years from now, thinking that it was kin killing kin

271
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,500
Plus, this will let the Dowager rest in peace

272
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
Next month is the birthday of the previous Emperor.

273
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,600
If the opportunity arises,

274
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,500
I want to beg for Father's mercy on behalf of Eighth and Fourteenth Prince.

275
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,600
This is the most filial thing I can do for the previous Emperor and the Empress Dowager.

276
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,900
You've thought long and hard about this. I didn't even think of it.

277
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,800
Ok, if I get a chance that day

278
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,400
I will definitely beg our father

279
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,900
and try to persuade him

280
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Niang niang, drink some tea

281
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,600
The emperor still will not let you go outside

282
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,800
You've been with him for so many years

283
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,900
and you've never been house arrested before

284
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,800
Consort Xi is in favor right now, and she's been house arrested many times

285
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,100
I'm the Empress. I can handle it.

286
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,100
Oh yes, I heard that the Third Prince begged the Emperor for you

287
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,600
But he was lectured by the Emperor

288
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,200
Third Prince is so stupid. At this moment he should be protecting himself

289
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,200
He's just trying to be filial

290
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,400
When filiality is not used correctly, it can cause harm instead

291
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,500
Now I can only hope that on the past Emperor's birthday

292
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,100
Third Prince will meet my expectations

293
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,300
If Third Prince has a good future

294
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,400
then all this suffering will not have been for nothing

295
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,700
You have performed your duties well

296
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,900
My father's ceremony was performed very well

297
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,700
Thank you father

298
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,500
I have seen all of your good work

299
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,300
That's right, I've heard that

300
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,200
you've been to prison to see your uncle Yin Ci many times

301
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,200
Yes

302
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,400
Eighth Uncle is very miserable

303
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,700
Wow, you are so gracious and loving

304
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,300
Eighth uncle made a big mistake

305
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,200
No matter how much you punish him, he deserves it

306
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:46,956
But in the memory of your father

307
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,800
Eighth prince is your brother after all

308
00:19:49,112 --> 00:19:51,591
I would think that if grandfather was alive, then

309
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,300
he would want to see all his sons getting along

310
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,800
What else?

311
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,000
Also,

312
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:01,072
Fourteenth Uncle

313
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,300
Father,

314
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,300
Fourteenth uncle is my blood uncle

315
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,400
he's your pure brother

316
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:10,186
but he's been under house arrest this whole time

317
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:11,746
I remember when grandfather was alive, Thirteenth Uncle was also under house arrest

318
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,400
And father, you begged grandfather for Thirteenth Uncle's release

319
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,000
It would be nice if, in the memory of grandfather,

320
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,100
you could let Fourteenth Uncle free

321
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,800
I see you've been thinking about your uncles quite frequently

322
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,200
I don't dare

323
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,200
But I heard that when the Dowager was ill, she kept asking for Fourteenth Uncle

324
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,226
I was thinking...

325
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,500
If at the time, Fourteenth Uncle could have been there...

326
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,300
If your Fourteenth Uncle was free,

327
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,400
then the Dowager's illness would have been cured?

328
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,500
You think I've been unfilial towards the Dowager?

329
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't dare

330
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,300
You don't dare?

331
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,700
Weren't you just talking about brotherly love?

332
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,300
About how my lack of brother love

333
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,800
resulted in my brother's disrespect towards me

334
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,100
Filiality

335
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,200
You were saying how I am not filial

336
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,900
so there is no need for you to be filial to me as well?

337
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:04,765
That's not what I meant

338
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,300
Father

339
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,600
I was thinking for your legacy

340
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,900
Father,

341
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,800
Even if my uncles have mistakes

342
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,500
they are still your brothers

343
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,600
Though Empress has made mistakes

344
00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:21,503
she is still your wife.

345
00:21:21,503 --> 00:21:23,996
I can withstand your momentary anger

346
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:27,121
but I must think for your legacy

347
00:21:27,277 --> 00:21:30,219
You house arrested your brothers and wife

348
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,400
I am worried

349
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,500
how others will guess...

350
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,900
How the people will think?!

351
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,500
What I think you really want is to be my ruler as well

352
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Though I am your father

353
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:48,132
you have not gotten the facts right

354
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,000
and have already accused me of crimes

355
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,500
In your eyes, am I such a terrible Emperor?

356
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,300
Or have you long watched my "mistakes" and have been wanting to replace me?

357
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,500
I don't dare! I don't dare!

358
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,900
Since I ascended the throne

359
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,462
your Eighth and Fourteenth uncles

360
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,200
have done nothing but createdtrouble and disrespect me. You have seen all of this.

361
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,600
Yet today, you have switched sides

362
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,900
You want to beg for those that wish me harm

363
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,600
You have joined forces to besmirch my name

364
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,700
As for your Empress mother, why I have chosen to house arrest her,

365
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
is not only for Noble Consort Xi's unborn child

366
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,600
All this time, your Empress has created trouble

367
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,900
just to make sure you ascend the throne in the future

368
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,000
Father <br> You still dare call me father?

369
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,300
You are my oldest son, but you are weak and useless

370
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,200
Yet I have always spoke up for you, cherished you and forgiven you

371
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,800
Unfortunately fate wouldn't have it

372
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,900
somehow I have taught you to become someone else's son!

373
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,100
To the point that you beg for your Eighth uncle! Why don't you be his son instead!

374
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Father

375
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,400
You can be angry

376
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,900
but you don't want me as a son anymore?

377
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,200
It was you that didn't want me as a father, not the other way arround

378
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,600
Su Pei Shen!

379
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,200
Enforce my decree: Third Prince is not allowed in the palace anymore

380
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,900
He has empathized with Eighth Prince

381
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:31,614
Let him be Eighth Prince's son

382
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,500
Eighth Prince made mistakes, so he was stripped of honors

383
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
And is no longer in the family tree

384
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,700
Since Third Prince is now his son

385
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,900
He must also be stripped of honors

386
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,700
Remove his honors right now

387
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,500
And give it to Lord Heng

388
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,800
I do not have this son

389
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,700
Emperor... <br> Do it now!

390
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,200
I obey

391
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,700
Niang niang

392
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,300
Something terrible has happened!

393
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,700
Third Prince

394
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,700
he...

395
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,300
said something wrong again?

396
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,000
It's ok if he couldn't convince the Emperor to release me

397
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,800
Most important is that he still cares for me

398
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,200
which means that I can rise again in the future

399
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,000
The emperor stripped him of his royal honors

400
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,500
and made him Eighth Prince's son instead

401
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,400
What did you say?!

402
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,300
The decree was already given to the officials

403
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,200
You're lying!

404
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,700
Third Prince is the Emperor's son! This is not possible.

405
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:56,700
I don't dare to make this up. Third Prince spoke up for 8th and 14th uncle, and you. So the emperor accused him of treason

406
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,500
Everything was fine. Why did he speak up for those criminals?

407
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,600
All my effort these past years has been for nothing

408
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,500
It is all wasted

409
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,700
Niang niang, think of something to save him!

410
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,000
Useless!

411
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,400
The emperor has always been cold. So little and he has broken this father son bond.

412
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,800
Niang niang

413
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
If Third Prince can't ascend the throne...

414
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,800
If there's no 3rd prince, there is always 4th and 5th prince, and so on

415
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,200
Plus there is also a 6th prince now

416
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,500
6th prince?

417
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Just like how Consort Qi died. If there wasn't Zhen Huan

418
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,000
then I could have raised 6th prince

419
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,900
It's all ok

420
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:58,700
as long as I am still Empress, I can still rise again

421
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,700
No one's child matters!

422
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,800
If my child was still alive, I would be the only Dowager Empress

423
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,100
Have you prepared the object that I asked for?

424
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,100
Yes, everything is ready. But the Empress doesn't know. Should I tell her?

425
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,200
If a master suffers humiliation, it is only because the servant was useless.

426
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:41,526
I've been with the Empress so many years. She's never suffered this kind of humiliation

427
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,400
A royal Empress house arrested after being set up by a lowly consort?!

428
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,600
She even caused the Empress to lose 3rd prince as support. This cannot be the law of the land.

429
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,500
But this is too big. If anything goes awry, then both our lives will be in danger

430
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:03,700
It doesn't matter if I lose my life. As long as Noble Consort Xi is gone, then the Empress can rest easy.

431
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,900
Give it to me

432
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,400
17th brother

433
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,300
Our father's ceremony is over

434
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,200
I've remembered the times when he was still alive

435
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,000
the things I taught you

436
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:39,042
It was such foresight

437
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Thus the tears today

438
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,200
As a family, we should remember our brotherly love

439
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,300
I thank you for your love and concern

440
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,800
Sit down, Sit down

441
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,100
Family members don't need to be so polite

442
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:00,556
If our father was alive

443
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,900
seeing that you have a family now

444
00:28:03,928 --> 00:28:06,431
and almost a child

445
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,600
he would be very happy

446
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,000
Everything that I have was given to me with your blessing

447
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,700
I have not forgotten our father's teachings

448
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You have respected your brothers

449
00:28:26,227 --> 00:28:29,076
and respected your place and title

450
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:30,913
We are

451
00:28:31,308 --> 00:28:36,696
merry brothers and good court members

452
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,000
Yes

453
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,200
A little brother is in my stomach. 6th prince, do you like him?

454
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,300
I want a little sister

455
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,400
What about you my lord?

456
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,400
Both are good

457
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,500
6th prince is so little and he likes your child

458
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,800
They must be fated to be together

459
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,600
Of course cousins are fated to be together

460
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,300
6th prince

461
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,900
Come and drink some soup

462
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,500
Don't bother your aunt

463
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,100
But I want my aunt to feed me!

464
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,400
Ok, your aunt can feed you

465
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,800
What's wrong?!

466
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:09,238
Get the doctor!

467
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,600
Doctor!

468
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,000
What's wrong? She was fine earlier!

469
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,900
Yes,... it looks like poison

470
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,400
There's poison in the food. Guards! Protect the emperor!

471
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,000
Emperor, if her Ladyship is truly poisoned, then this place is not safe. You should go back to your palace

472
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:38,000
I am not leaving. I want to see who dares

473
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,000
to poison in front of me

474
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,700
Move her to the back room

475
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,300
My Lord

476
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,700
I'm here

477
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,200
My lord

478
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,000
Hurry

479
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,500
Silver needle?

480
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,000
It's poison

481
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,000
Poison?

482
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,300
Oh no, she's already 8 months pregnant

483
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,200
Get the medicine to induce labor

484
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,900
Hurry

485
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,500
My lord, let me feel her pulse

486
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,700
It is fortunate that she did not ingest too much poison. It did not harm the fetus.

487
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,300
My lord, rest assured. The doctors will take care of her.

488
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,900
I will go and report to the emperor

489
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,044
Hurry

490
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,000
My Lord,

491
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:10,511
who would want to harm me?

492
00:32:16,442 --> 00:32:18,089
Emperor,

493
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:20,181
Her ladyship was poisoned

494
00:32:25,087 --> 00:32:28,887
Why would there be poison at a royal feast?

495
00:32:31,364 --> 00:32:34,191
What was the last thing she ate?

496
00:32:40,728 --> 00:32:42,729
She was feeding 6th prince's food to him

497
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,329
Jin Xi

498
00:33:04,147 --> 00:33:06,883
The needle turned black. Indeed there was poison

499
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:09,250
What about this bowl?

500
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:20,559
This bowl has poison too

501
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,200
Because someone wants to kill me and 6th prince

502
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,091
Her ladyship was collateral

503
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,186
I am here

504
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:39,439
Investigate!

505
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:42,877
How could these dirty things

506
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,300
get into Noble Consort Xi and 6th prince's food

507
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:51,408
My Lord

508
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,881
Am I going to die soon?

509
00:33:57,332 --> 00:33:59,604
Don't think too much. The doctors are all here

510
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,071
My lord, I let you drink too much

511
00:34:10,044 --> 00:34:12,585
and that's the only reason we had this child

512
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,526
Don't say that

513
00:34:15,841 --> 00:34:17,526
I will stay by your side

514
00:34:17,784 --> 00:34:19,674
I will always stay by your side

515
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,581
I have investigated

516
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:30,983
The royal kitchen prepared the food and the servants brought it over

517
00:34:31,233 --> 00:34:34,555
The servant that brought Noble Consort Xi and 6th Prince's soup say that

518
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,600
on the way she ran into the Empress's servant, Jian Qiu

519
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:40,946
Jian Qiu opened the food to see what was inside

520
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:43,708
Other than that, no one else has touched the food

521
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,500
I have brought Jian Qiu with me

522
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,900
Bring her in

523
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,910
Who told you to do this

524
00:35:12,953 --> 00:35:16,525
Who. Told. You. To. Do. This?

525
00:35:16,678 --> 00:35:19,084
No one

526
00:35:19,582 --> 00:35:21,666
It was all my idea

527
00:35:22,377 --> 00:35:23,837
Was it the empress?

528
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:27,640
She is house arrested

529
00:35:27,788 --> 00:35:30,352
She doesn't know anything about this

530
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:35,121
It was all my idea

531
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,129
She wants to commit suicide!

532
00:35:45,678 --> 00:35:46,923
Emperor

533
00:35:47,116 --> 00:35:49,730
Why can't you believe the empress?

534
00:35:50,196 --> 00:35:52,812
She is your wife! She truly loves you!

535
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:54,569
Take her away and punish her severely!

536
00:35:54,827 --> 00:35:58,971
Make her tell us the truth!

537
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,564
She is your wife! She is the empress!

538
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:02,677
Emperor

539
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,768
Why can't you believe her?

540
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,358
Take her away

541
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,823
Noble Consort Xi, aren't you afraid of bad karma?

542
00:36:10,846 --> 00:36:12,843
You will die horrifically

543
00:36:13,848 --> 00:36:15,846
Noble Consort Xi, you are an evil person!

544
00:36:16,128 --> 00:36:17,486
Evil person!

545
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:34,721
Emperor, she has given birth to a boy

546
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,700
But her ladyship was weak after labor

547
00:36:38,723 --> 00:36:41,605
and the poison too effect. She has just passed away.

548
00:37:02,242 --> 00:37:03,665
Jian Qiu

549
00:37:05,383 --> 00:37:06,794
niang niang

550
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:08,542
Where is Jian Qiu

551
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,900
Why haven't I seen her?

552
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,700
Also where is Jiang Fu Hai?

553
00:37:13,225 --> 00:37:16,277
Would you like some water? I can get it

554
00:37:16,563 --> 00:37:18,305
I am asking you a question!

555
00:37:18,554 --> 00:37:20,924
Why are you changing the subject?

556
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:25,884
What could it possibly be that I can't handle?

557
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Jian Qiu has not returned

558
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:30,970
Eunuch Jiang has also been taken away

559
00:37:31,204 --> 00:37:32,122
Who dares!

560
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,841
How could anyone just take my people away?

561
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:37,238
No one even asked me

562
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:41,174
It was the corrections facility... they were obeying the emperor's orders

563
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,690
They said it was unnecessary for you to know

564
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,163
What happened?

565
00:37:47,629 --> 00:37:49,572
I do not know

566
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:51,000
I just heard that

567
00:37:51,283 --> 00:37:53,448
Jian Qiu tried to harm Noble Consort Xi

568
00:37:53,768 --> 00:37:55,038
and poisoned her Ladyship

569
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:00,689
We've tortured you. Are you ready to tell the truth now?

570
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,800
The empress never did anything

571
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,314
There is nothing to say

572
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:11,135
You can't just torture me until I lie

573
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:13,083
The Emperor will not believe such confessions

574
00:38:14,122 --> 00:38:15,576
In the future

575
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,578
The Empress will not forgive you stupid lot

576
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,300
I are obeying the emperor's orders

577
00:38:22,402 --> 00:38:23,757
To use all means necessary

578
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:25,755
to get the truth out of you

579
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,000
Even if your body is made of steel

580
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,966
you can't withstand all the torture

581
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:35,088
If you don't want to tell the truth

582
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,300
then let's use the needles

583
00:38:37,788 --> 00:38:40,237
You don't dare! <br> Whether or not we dare is not up to us,

584
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,596
It is up to this needle

585
00:38:42,915 --> 00:38:47,741
If this needle dares to pierce your fingers

586
00:38:47,953 --> 00:38:51,733
You will not confess? Let us do this first.

587
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:54,304
Let me go!

588
00:39:00,886 --> 00:39:02,480
We told you to tell us the truth!

589
00:39:03,285 --> 00:39:04,183
What about you?

590
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:08,536
Will you speak?

591
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:11,593
Speak!

592
00:39:12,131 --> 00:39:15,375
Who knows if those servants will speak?

593
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,000
Don't they say that the servant in charge

594
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,252
is more effective than prison guards?

595
00:39:22,502 --> 00:39:26,156
But Jian Qiu has always been loyal to the Empress

596
00:39:28,484 --> 00:39:30,276
I'm worried she won't tell

597
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:32,369
If not Jian Qiu, there is always Eunuch Jiang

598
00:39:32,883 --> 00:39:34,678
If not Eunuch Jiang

599
00:39:35,002 --> 00:39:37,645
there is always the servant Wei Chun.

600
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:40,444
At least one of them will give it up

601
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:43,556
Once one hole has ripped open

602
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:46,147
the rest will come falling out

603
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,247
Hearing you say this, I feel a lot better

604
00:39:50,631 --> 00:39:53,285
The drama has gotten so big

605
00:39:53,935 --> 00:39:56,662
If we don't continue to poke at the Emperor's emotional scar even more

606
00:39:58,069 --> 00:40:00,473
then, it will be truly out of hand
