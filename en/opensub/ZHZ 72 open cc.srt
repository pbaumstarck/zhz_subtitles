1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,400
What did those disgusting servants confess?

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,700
They admitted it. Apart from the murdering, they said more

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,400
and?

4
00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:20,228
What else?

5
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:23,566
others are just some small cases

6
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:27,791
but there is one that I have to report

7
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:30,428
what is it?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,300
Emperor,

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,200
the reason of xun yuan queen's death

10
00:00:39,112 --> 00:00:42,314
is related to the queen...

11
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:44,445
how dare you?

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,100
I don't meant to

13
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:59,790
you tell me everything

14
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:01,077
yes

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,600
I've asked the doctor. Normally eating small amounts of Ba Jiao is fine

16
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,200
But pregnant women cannot ingest even a little

17
00:01:11,326 --> 00:01:16,565
Medicines like Ba Jiao

18
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:21,529
can have aborting effects. Although the effects are not as obvious has Hong Hua

19
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:26,822
But if you cook the medicine, it can seep into food

20
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:34,623
After a long time, it can be very harmful. Also, the tea was switched to Tao Ren, which is also very harmful

21
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:40,737
Since it was mixed in, it was very hard to differentiate the taste

22
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:45,649
All of this was in Empress Chun Yuan's food and drink

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,900
Is this straight from the servants' mouth?

24
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:54,136
Jian Qiu didn't say anything, but Eunch Jiang

25
00:01:54,263 --> 00:01:57,523
told us everything

26
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,700
Also, Empress Chun Yuan's stillborn fetus was purple with bruises. That is also clear evidence.

27
00:02:04,318 --> 00:02:08,526
But wasn't that because the consort

28
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,000
used to make Chun Yuan worried and stressed all the time?

29
00:02:12,837 --> 00:02:17,870
The doctors say that all that stress just hid these signs

30
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,900
So it was her. Yes.

31
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,000
Other than harming Empress Chun Yuan, there is much more.

32
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,000
I thought that they were sisters.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,900
Blood sisters

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,500
She was always loving and gentle to Chun Yuan

35
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,900
Bring her here. We have been husband and wife for many years

36
00:03:15,984 --> 00:03:18,933
I believe

37
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:26,179
that she tried to scheme for the throne

38
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:31,440
and kill royal children

39
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:34,674
But about Chun Yuan, I want to hear from her directly

40
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:36,780
Yes.

41
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,900
At this point, do you confess your guilt?

42
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:52,154
If you already believe it, what is the point of asking me?

43
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:56,155
I need to hear it from you directly

44
00:03:56,263 --> 00:04:00,808
You think that I still want to see your face?

45
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:08,472
I have aged, it is no surprise that you do not want to see my face.

46
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:18,474
I just wonder if Jie Jie was still alive, if you would like her aged face as well.

47
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:22,580
I deeply regret

48
00:04:22,664 --> 00:04:28,267
I should have let you see her aged face as well

49
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:34,592
Then you may not hate me so much

50
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,193
Beauty is the result of a pure heart

51
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:43,357
Even if Chun Yuan ages and becomes frail, she will still be superior to you a thousand fold

52
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:57,800
You gave me this jade bracelet to me when I first married into the palace. You even put it on me yourself.

53
00:04:57,953 --> 00:05:02,482
We hoped to be like this bracelet. To see each other every day.

54
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:08,851
Yet today, you say you don't want to see me anymore because I've made mistakes

55
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,800
Back then, you would look at this bracelet and say to me

56
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:21,814
that if I bore sons, then I would be the official wife.

57
00:05:23,977 --> 00:05:29,311
Yet when I did bear a son, you already married my sister and made her the official wife

58
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:36,914
And my son had to be the son of a consort instead

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,300
He had to be like me, the child of a consort instead of an official wife.

60
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:44,695
You know I didn't care of the difference statuses of a consort vs official

61
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:52,000
My mother didn't care either. Both my mother and I were born from consorts

62
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,654
But emperor, how could you understand?

63
00:05:54,737 --> 00:05:58,313
The daughters of consorts are so miserable

64
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:02,674
Consort vs official determines your fate

65
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,553
My mother and I rarely got respect

66
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:10,857
Do you understand?

67
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:14,756
I do understand. And because I understand

68
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,800
when you married me, I treated you very well. Even when Chun Yuan became the official, I made you the second highest.

69
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,822
Yet you are never satisfied.

70
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:29,963
What should have been my official position was snatched away by another

71
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:34,473
The crown prince position was also snatched away

72
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:39,593
Even my husband's love and affection was given to her

73
00:06:40,214 --> 00:06:44,754
I want to be satisfied, but I can't

74
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,836
Chun Yuan was your blood sister!

75
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:54,673
It was my mistake to let you marry into the family

76
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:58,874
Your mistake wasn't marrying me,

77
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:04,600
but rather marrying my Jie Jie, and only loving my Jie Jie

78
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,300
If you think you're smart <br> there's always someone smarter.

79
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,000
You are so wise, how can you not understand when it is your own issue

80
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:19,756
It was my mistake to so highly regard your sisterly affection

81
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,600
Are you afraid of bad karma?

82
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,200
You're not afraid that Chun Yuan and her stillborn will come haunt you?

83
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,000
If she wants to haunt me, let her!

84
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,200
That way I can stop imagining and hearing my child nonstop crying

85
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:43,250
When my child was ill, Jie Jie just became pregannt

86
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:50,641
You only cared that Jie Jie was pregnant. You didn't care about our child

87
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:59,915
He was only 3 years old. His whole body was hot with fever and died from lack of medical treatment

88
00:08:02,296 --> 00:08:07,297
I held his body in my arms and walked in the rain the entire night

89
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:12,565
I wanted to ask the gods for help

90
00:08:12,565 --> 00:08:16,964
If you want a life, take mine, not my son's

91
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:31,335
And then Jie Jie got pregnant. Her son took my son's life! How could I sit idly as her son becomes the Crown Prince

92
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:33,827
You're crazy

93
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,024
It was MY decision to marry Chun Yuan. It was MY choice to make her the official wife.

94
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:43,169
It was ME that had a child with her. Why didn't you hate me?

95
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:47,566
You think I didn't want to?

96
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:53,105
I wanted to hate you

97
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:59,245
But I couldn't do it

98
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:06,120
In your eyes, all you could see was Jie Jie.

99
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,600
How could you know that my love for you was no less that your love for Jie Jie

100
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,041
Emperor

101
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,662
You think that Jie Jie loved you a lot?

102
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:24,119
You think Noble Consort Xi loves you?

103
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:34,756
All women who love their husbands cannot stand watching their husband love and have children with others

104
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:40,760
I can't do it.

105
00:09:42,002 --> 00:09:49,352
You think that I'm evil and jealous, but I'm the one that truly loves you

106
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Thus, I did so much

107
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,400
You disgust me.

108
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,880
- music -

109
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:13,406
If it wasn't that I was in the position of Empress, having to protect myself

110
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,681
I would hope that you can remember some of my good traits

111
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:25,248
Don't you think I wish I wasn't jealous?

112
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:33,241
My instinctual loyalty to you is also the source of my pain

113
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,700
The Empress

114
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:52,280
Empress Wulanla,

115
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:56,783
Disobeyed God's will

116
00:10:57,664 --> 00:11:04,755
Killed royal children and schemed for the throne, despite being the mother of the country

117
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:11,125
Is demoted to a citizen and is house arrested for eternity

118
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,900
Get my seal

119
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,500
Yes

120
00:11:19,657 --> 00:11:24,525
Good Night Emperor

121
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,200
Why are you here Gu Gu

122
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,322
I know that there has been much chaos today. In order to relieve your stress, I have brought the Dowager's royal decree

123
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:41,846
My mother had a decree?

124
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:48,000
I do not dare to lie to you. If you do not believe me, you can look at the decree

125
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,300
It is in the Dowager's handwriting

126
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,000
We can read this later. First I want to get rid of this evil woman.

127
00:11:55,084 --> 00:12:00,689
The Dowager's decree is regarding today's issue. Would the Emperor please kneel to receive the decree?

128
00:12:09,757 --> 00:12:19,315
After my passing, if the Emperor wishes to get rid of the Empress, our Wu family cannot bear the shame.

129
00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:34,259
The Emperor cannot get rid of the Empress. <br> This is indeed my mother's handwriting

130
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:39,875
Wife Ci'er Wulanala, of noble bearing and virtuous upbringing,

131
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:48,492
possesses all necessary women's virtues, is learned in the six practices, has displayed gentleness and excellence,

132
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:56,414
and is worthy of being the mother of the nation. Ordained by the Empress Dowager, I became Empress with all proper ceremonies.

133
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,900
The End.

134
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:07,222
That was the royal decree you wrote when you made me empress. Do you remember?

135
00:13:08,435 --> 00:13:13,301
You are a filial son. You cannot disregard the Dowager's decree

136
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:19,390
The only reason I did not follow the Dowager to heaven, was to enforce this last decree

137
00:13:19,473 --> 00:13:22,955
But her crime is unforgivable

138
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:28,679
I must get rid of her

139
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:34,169
Even Chun Yuan and the Dowager would be angered

140
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:39,156
With her last breath, the Dowager instructed me that if you still want to get rid of the Empress, I would ask you

141
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:45,428
What was Chun Yuan's last words when she was dying?

142
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:52,589
Chun Yuan was already very frail

143
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:56,935
her head rested on my knees and said

144
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:05,627
I cannot accompany you into old age

145
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:10,799
Even our child did not survive

146
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:22,512
I only have one sister. I hope you can look after her no matter what

147
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:26,436
Do not get rid of her

148
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:32,036
You promised her that you would never get rid of her sister

149
00:14:32,115 --> 00:14:38,276
You must forgive the Empress so that Chun Yuan can rest in peace

150
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:46,038
You dislike the Empress. You do not even want to call her by her name. You call her by her last name

151
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,500
But Chun Yuan was also by the same last name

152
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:58,202
And the Dowager was by that name. Even you, the emperor, have blood from the Wu family.

153
00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:03,558
It is the Dowager's decree that the Wu family cannot be removed as Empress

154
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:28,295
Seeing as I am feeling nostalgic

155
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:35,758
The Wu family woman is house arrested to this palace and can never leave until she dies.

156
00:15:38,002 --> 00:15:44,238
Go get my decree that made her Empress

157
00:15:44,349 --> 00:15:51,238
And the royal seals

158
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:57,003
We are never to meet again in this lifetime

159
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,280
I got it.

160
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:28,598
Can't you hear all this noise?

161
00:16:28,718 --> 00:16:32,976
If the Emperor gets angry, look out for your lives!

162
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:40,079
Bo Ke has raised an army of 40,000

163
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:45,218
If Ye Ming Guan falls, then Beijing may not be safe either

164
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:49,957
I also know his ambition very well

165
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:59,621
All these years, there has been much trouble within the nation, that I haven't had time to take care of this matter

166
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:06,908
Today, even a small tribe dares to usurp me!

167
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:14,000
We just took care of Xi Bei. There was also another uprising. The treasury is much depleted

168
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:21,437
If Bo Ge attacks now, we will indeed have to scramble

169
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:27,187
I sent General Bo Er Dan

170
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:33,759
can't handle the heat. Every year many die from illness. We are truly unable to handle it

171
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:37,799
If we had to send another general

172
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:40,572
it would be a little difficult at the moment

173
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:45,277
It is easy to have soldiers, but difficult to find a good general.

174
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,054
I dare to say something disrespectful... If we could use 14th Prince...

175
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:51,802
No.

176
00:17:51,878 --> 00:18:01,160
It is easy to free a tiger, but difficult to tame. Once he is free, if he decides to rebel, it will be a big trouble

177
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:06,998
We all don't want to anger the emperor. We don't know how to serve him.

178
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,647
Haven't you seen all the reports being sent to the Emperor these days?

179
00:18:11,678 --> 00:18:16,198
How to serve? Serve as if you life depends on it.

180
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,238
Yong He Gong's servants came to ask if the Emperor wants to eat lunch there.

181
00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:27,040
The Emperor ate little for breakfast

182
00:18:27,158 --> 00:18:33,399
He hasn't even touched lunch. He's worked so hard, even his eyes are red.

183
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:36,988
then what's wrong with the Emperor?

184
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,518
What's wrong? Ask God

185
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:44,142
The person who takes my place in battle

186
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:47,648
should at least be a royal prince or lord

187
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:52,724
17th prince is a good choice

188
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:59,346
But his mother's status isn't very high. He's also not very politically active.

189
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:04,239
But you have considered many factors; I am in awe.

190
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:10,726
He's always loved studying. I will give him a promotion then.

191
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:14,079
As for the fighting general, you need to choose well.

192
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:16,281
Yes

193
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:22,629
You need to do this quietly. Give 2000 men to 17th prince.

194
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:28,339
Once the front lines are more settled, you can send him in.

195
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,594
Yes

196
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,243
Close the window, I don't want to hear the wind.

197
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:37,960
Yes.

198
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:45,472
Don't worry, Emperor, you are so powerful that you can have everything under control.

199
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,962
Take a look at this!

200
00:19:57,011 --> 00:20:00,932
Zhun Ge Er wants the Qing Empire to pay him 300,000 taels

201
00:20:01,011 --> 00:20:06,461
This Mo Ge is Zhun Ge Er's new Khan (King), young and full of energy, ambitious

202
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:11,952
By doing so, one, he is tested the Qing's power

203
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:17,682
Two, he wants to use this chance to go to war and go down into history as a good warrior that won lands

204
00:20:17,765 --> 00:20:21,806
Mo Ge is testing Your Majesty, you cannot agree to his request

205
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:28,813
That goes without saying. He does not know his boundaries because he has strong armies and plentiful harvest

206
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:32,045
I cannot look over this matter

207
00:20:34,354 --> 00:20:37,405
Your Majesty, Lord Zhang Ting Yu wishes an audience with you

208
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,884
Yes

209
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:42,733
I will take my leave first

210
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:54,106
I greet Your Majesty.

211
00:20:54,106 --> 00:20:56,324
Get up.

212
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:05,255
Yue General has sent an urgent about that the enemy solders had food poisoning.

213
00:21:08,043 --> 00:21:11,243
The heavens look after my Qing Empire

214
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:17,507
Zhun Mo Ge requests for an audience with Your Majesty

215
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:21,504
Why does he want to come to the capital?

216
00:21:21,553 --> 00:21:28,585
The Khan has come to the capital at this time when his armies are strong and their harvest bountiful

217
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:32,784
Your Majesty, we must be wary of them

218
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:38,265
You send people to the Khan's and find out his motives and reasons

219
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:45,763
I remember Physician Wen left a prescription

220
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,825
Maybe it would be able to put into use

221
00:21:49,485 --> 00:21:51,313
Yes

222
00:21:51,426 --> 00:21:58,210
Older sister, we cannot let the 17th Brother go into war. His Majesty has always been jealous of his talent

223
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,800
This honour of going into war, the previous Prince has seen to its 'benefits'

224
00:22:03,774 --> 00:22:07,985
His Majesty's temperamental you know it well, even I cannot say anything to this decision

225
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:15,186
But to stop this, there is only one way. And the only excuse is to say that one is useless

226
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:20,026
This way, His Majesty would be happy and 18th Brother (Wangye) with then be safe

227
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:22,459
Can't the Wangye not go?

228
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:27,445
The Court is in want of competent people.<br>There are not many qinwangs that the Emperor can trust.

229
00:22:27,505 --> 00:22:33,104
No wonder Yun Xi (her husband) is so fed up and raving at home. The country is on verge of war and he wants to bring armies

230
00:22:33,266 --> 00:22:38,344
Only that he has written many reports to the King, but the King has replied none

231
00:22:38,386 --> 00:22:42,946
Beile Shen (Yun Xi) is still young. Naturally, there'll still be plenty of opportunities for him to contribute.

232
00:22:43,024 --> 00:22:46,881
Only 17th brother is appreciated by the King

233
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:49,957
Forget it.

234
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:54,338
Wangye is unlucky to be used by the King. I'm so worried for him.

235
00:22:54,504 --> 00:22:59,122
Who knows his future?

236
00:23:02,226 --> 00:23:06,174
Mo Ge is already near the capital but Your Majesty is not anxious to see him

237
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,300
I refuse to give him glory coming to the capital

238
00:23:09,987 --> 00:23:15,027
Mo Ge comes to capital full of zest, Your Majesty's cold shoulders is the best remedy to cool him down.

239
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:19,726
2 days later is 7th day of 7th month, I will go Yuan Ming Yuan (famous garden) to see him

240
00:23:19,726 --> 00:23:23,503
The relevant details get Lord Zhang to plan

241
00:23:32,426 --> 00:23:36,973
Your Majesty, Mo Ge is outside, waiting for an audience with you

242
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:38,933
- Tell him to come in.<br> - Yes.

243
00:23:42,977 --> 00:23:47,709
Announcing Zhun Mo Ge coming.

244
00:23:52,908 --> 00:24:00,190
<i>Liking something for me means I like it and I will try anything to obtain it.</i>

245
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:11,950
Khan is here to see your Majesty.

246
00:24:17,348 --> 00:24:22,735
You came here to meet your Majesty, why are you not using our etiquette.

247
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:31,800
“Isn't it delightful to have friends coming from distant place?"

248
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:36,450
Today is July the 7th and you Majesty has invited close friend and family for the banquet.

249
00:24:36,593 --> 00:24:41,808
Hearing Khan say proverb in Zhun Ge Er language,"Isn't it delightful to have friends coming from distant place?"

250
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:46,998
Jun Zi deal with things carefully without errors as well as treat people respectfully

251
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:50,196
All men between Four Seas should be all brothers!

252
00:24:50,196 --> 00:24:54,710
- I haven't seen you for awhile.<br>- You still look the same.

253
00:24:54,749 --> 00:24:59,429
Khan seems to like the Analects of Confucius.

254
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:06,062
My 17th brother, Prince Guo of the Second Ran loves the poetry and literature the most.

255
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,525
Khan and him can learn from each other when you are free.

256
00:25:33,886 --> 00:25:39,271
Han only pour liquor on floor when it comes to people dying<br>How dare you curse me?

257
00:25:39,301 --> 00:25:45,327
Khan has misunderstood. I didn't mean to curse you. I am using the highest regard to welcome you to our palace.

258
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:51,926
Khan is our special guest. The first glass of wine is to thank the god to bring in the special guest.

259
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:56,110
This is a little bit far fetched.

260
00:25:56,134 --> 00:26:01,629
Khan don't blame yourself. The only interaction our nations have are only for trading

261
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,270
for many days their has been many deaths because of the war

262
00:26:07,453 --> 00:26:14,502
Without a doubt, our relations became alienated <br>Hopefully, your attendance to Da Qing today can improve our relations

263
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,728
Then there's no more wars;<br>citizens can have peaceful life as well

264
00:26:19,895 --> 00:26:27,503
How wise and eloquent are you, Xi Noble Consort<br>You look nothing like the consorts who always keep indoors

265
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:32,228
Khan, I am flattered<br> I am only stating the truth

266
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,900
what is know was taught to me by the emperer

267
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:39,285
How can I accept this praise from you Khan?

268
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,468
What she said is exactly what I meant

269
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:49,578
Cheers, Khan<br> For the joy of meeting today

270
00:26:54,045 --> 00:27:00,463
Ok. Wish Da Qing Emperor long live！

271
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,400
Sit

272
00:27:19,894 --> 00:27:24,869
Present.<br> Today is the 7 day of the 7 month.

273
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:29,671
I have a special item that I want to share with you together

274
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:38,500
I gained a Nine Jade Rings a few years ago. The name was given because lots of jade craftsmen sacrificed themselves

275
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:42,511
during plucking as well as worked diligently to make the ring

276
00:27:42,706 --> 00:27:46,829
It is said that Zhong Yuan is full of intelligent people

277
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:52,555
May I ask you to do me a favor to unlock this Nine Jade Rings?

278
00:27:52,637 --> 00:28:00,014
Present this to all the Da Chen, <br>whoever unlock it can receive grand prize

279
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,574
Yes

280
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:05,950
Dancing time

281
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,900
Emperor said that whoever unlock this can be greatly rewarded. What do you think?

282
00:28:37,297 --> 00:28:41,213
What do you think?

283
00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:12,563
Sir,

284
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:15,693
-Please take a look, Da Ren,<br>-No, I don't know

285
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,070
No no

286
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:21,671
Da Ren, what do you think?

287
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:35,309
-How do you feel about it? <br>- The jade rings are turned out naturally, I can't undo this

288
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:39,188
Won't you take a closer look, please?

289
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:58,438
Emperor, nobody can unlock the rings

290
00:30:03,187 --> 00:30:05,990
Show it to all Wang Ye

291
00:30:06,043 --> 00:30:08,061
Yes

292
00:30:09,534 --> 00:30:13,149
Go away, I feel dizzy

293
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:28,694
I don't know either

294
00:30:29,368 --> 00:30:34,148
-Yun Xi<br>-I usually don't like golden or jade jewelry

295
00:30:34,229 --> 00:30:36,791
I have not a clue

296
00:30:37,155 --> 00:30:39,855
Xi Noble Consort

297
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,200
-I can't solve it<br>-So I guess "Da Qing is full of wise" is just a fake rumor

298
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,100
So its not true that the Qing Dynasty has many wise men

299
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Long Yue

300
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,100
Yes

301
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:21,216
Dad, I have an idea, maybe that would work

302
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:26,757
Even the Court officials can't come up with a solution.<br>How can a girl like you have a solution?

303
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:34,955
Your daughter is young and lacks knowledge. <br>Even if I give the wrong solution, no one will laugh. Why don't you let me try?

304
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,489
Fine then.

305
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,709
Look, Imperial father! I've untangled it!

306
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:03,300
Longyue is the most favored in my heart.

307
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:12,247
You don't have to compliment me because everyone in Da Qing knows how to do it.They just too disdained to tell you

308
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:16,080
How could you...!, this Nine Jade Rings is priceless

309
00:32:16,956 --> 00:32:24,961
To me,the jade rings is a very common item.Merely for a little piece of jewelry,you completely lose your tolerance.Are all Zhun

310
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,700
Ge Er people that cheap?

311
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:35,497
The jade rings are our nation's precious item.<br>Now that you break it, how are you going to responsible for it?

312
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:38,042
Longyue.

313
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:42,421
The princess is young. Please don't be angry, Khan.<br>Congratulations, Khan.

314
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:47,626
The Princess's friendly action, in fact, will bring your nation auspicious and harmonious air.

315
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:56,079
Jade stands for ominous things which would bring harm to civilians.Thus,princess actually helped break the unlucky jade

316
00:32:56,742 --> 00:33:09,489
Of course, breaking the jade rings made Khan feel unhappy.

317
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:13,484
Xi Noble Consort is right

318
00:33:13,598 --> 00:33:23,163
If hatred continues war in inevitable <br> Why not change for the better don't know of Ke Han agrees

319
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:27,870
Using ants to stop a predator?

320
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:31,721
What does Your Majesty think?

321
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,559
Your Majesty, this is the newly brewed orange wine. Your Majesty give it a taste.

322
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:53,092
Mr Zhang Ting Yu wanted to me tell you <br> that his part was a success

323
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,200
Ferocious beast has its power.

324
00:33:58,342 --> 00:34:04,119
Mole crickets and ants (also means tiny individuals with no power) have its own brightness.

325
00:34:04,254 --> 00:34:10,199
Khan, do you really know for sure who is going to win?

326
00:34:10,366 --> 00:34:14,280
It looks as if mole crickets and ants (also means tiny individuals with no power) have been losing for several rounds.

327
00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:19,119
Making concession in order to gain advantages. I believe Khan has studied books on the art of war, right?

328
00:34:19,242 --> 00:34:26,687
Khan likes to think that way but I hope it is not just talking in random.

329
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,359
I am the son of the god. Every word carries weight.

330
00:34:31,641 --> 00:34:37,522
Dragon gave birth to nine sons. There might be more than one son of the god.

331
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:47,450
We both have the same root, why do we try to hurt each other? Your nation belongs to me. Of course, I care about you.

332
00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:52,559
I have just heard that some of your solders have had little food poisoning out there.

333
00:34:54,397 --> 00:34:58,976
You are away from home, perhaps you don't have enough medication.

334
00:34:59,142 --> 00:35:03,999
Several years ago, we also had similar food poisoning happened.

335
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:10,619
I do have some secret recipe. If Khan needs it, I am more than happy to send someone to find it for you.

336
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:15,539
Thank you, Your Majesty. Khan will find it myself.

337
00:35:15,623 --> 00:35:21,420
That's fine. However, those doctors travel everywhere.

338
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:28,021
If I send people out to look for it, it might take as long as several months.

339
00:35:28,187 --> 00:35:32,059
I wish Khan well.

340
00:35:56,961 --> 00:35:59,879
I like to go and change, please.

341
00:36:06,483 --> 00:36:10,607
- Niang Niang. I have good news. <br> - Su eunuch.

342
00:36:10,689 --> 00:36:19,440
I have good news! Mr Yue Zhong Qi pretended to <br> confront with Zhun Ge Er secretly attacked his forage army

343
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:27,700
Without the forage, his army also infected with an epidemic <br> I kind of want to see how he's going to be superior

344
00:36:28,094 --> 00:36:30,552
What a good news!

345
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:34,140
Your Majesty will be very happy when he learned the news. I will be there momentarily.

346
00:36:34,306 --> 00:36:35,552
Yes.

347
00:36:38,324 --> 00:36:40,742
Please wait!

348
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:50,758
Hail Ke Han

349
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:53,989
How have you been, Noble Consort Ci?

350
00:36:54,287 --> 00:37:00,734
What do you mean, Khan? I have never met you before.

351
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:04,231
Why are you talking as if I have seen you before?

352
00:37:04,316 --> 00:37:09,188
I have eyes of eagle and never forget anyone I ever met.

353
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:13,235
Noble Consort Ci, you are really brave.

354
00:37:13,392 --> 00:37:17,328
You dare to have affair with Your Majesty's brother.

355
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:24,832
I have never make trouble for Khan.

356
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:28,407
Why would you think of harm my entire family?

357
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:32,310
Are you not afraid I told Your Majesty what I saw years ago?

358
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,708
About years ago,

359
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:44,062
Prince Guo of the Second Rank's 2nd wife is my sister who shares similar facial feature with me.

360
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:49,718
I have heard Prince and his 2nd wife travelled together and met Khan when you were hurt by a snake.

361
00:37:49,843 --> 00:37:56,759
Now that friends met again, Prince and his 2nd wife were going to invite you for a drink.

362
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:09,027
You really are good at words.

363
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:13,689
The women like Noble Consort Ci who are beautiful and smart at the same time.

364
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:18,617
Your Emperor of Qing likes it, and I like it too.

365
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:24,999
Khan, you're drunk. I'll notify the Emperor to fix a potion to help you wake up.

366
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:30,471
That's not necessary. Do you really think I'm afraid of your Emperor?

367
00:38:30,638 --> 00:38:35,436
He burned all the food for my army in secret and using the food poisoning to threaten me.

368
00:38:35,602 --> 00:38:37,577
It is too contemptible.

369
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:41,344
How can Khan not know that in war nothing is too deceitful?

370
00:38:41,427 --> 00:38:45,759
Disaster is caused by luck <br> Luck appeared with disaster,

371
00:38:46,134 --> 00:38:51,559
Noble Consort Ci, do you believe that I have some lost

372
00:38:51,692 --> 00:38:54,679
but at the same time I am going to have some gain?

373
00:38:54,817 --> 00:39:00,482
As long as we can put an end to the war and have peace, it is gain for both Qing Dynasty and your nation.

374
00:39:00,616 --> 00:39:05,600
I hope the thing I want, Your Emperor of Qing

375
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:08,696
will be willing to part with.

376
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,246
- scene -

377
00:39:31,675 --> 00:39:36,092
I have confirm it for Your Majesty. It did happen.

378
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:42,464
You take your people and make sure you find the evidence.

379
00:39:44,602 --> 00:39:45,999
I got it.

380
00:39:49,462 --> 00:39:52,712
Your Majesty, Khan Mo Ge would like to see you for an important matter.

381
00:39:53,098 --> 00:39:56,295
Khan said there is something he really like and hoping Your Majesty will grant it to him.
