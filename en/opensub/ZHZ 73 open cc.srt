1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
The Legend Of Zhen Huan <br>Episode 73

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,425
Your Majesty

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,796
Huangshang

4
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:13,600
Xi Guifei has been waiting inside for a while

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,069
call the 17th Prince waiting here

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,200
he can't go in without Zhen's call

7
00:00:35,347 --> 00:00:36,090
Huangshang are back

8
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,600
why look at Chenqie like this, Huangshang?

9
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,100
since when?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Chenqie are slow

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,700
don't know what Huangshang mean?

12
00:01:09,412 --> 00:01:10,853
Zhen has been favoring you

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,800
but at this moment

14
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,300
Zhen hate this face of yours

15
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,700
someone just told Zhen

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,900
the story of Zhaojun

17
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:26,938
is Muoge

18
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,800
Muoge came to see Zhen on a special purpose

19
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,800
ask Zhen allow you to marry him

20
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,200
when did he lay his eyes on you?

21
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,685
Chenqie is a concubine of the Heavenly Emperor

22
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:45,123
how could I marry someone for such purpose?

23
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,600
Muoge is ridiculous

24
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,300
How could Zhen not know he's ridiculous?

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,500
Zhen used you words to block his mouth

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,300
but he brought up the precedent of Han Yuan Emperor

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,600
compare Zhaojun to you, and asked Zhen to give my own favor up

28
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,700
this face of yours attracts Zhen so much

29
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,843
can attract others too

30
00:02:05,552 --> 00:02:06,973
Zhen should not have you seen him

31
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,500
Ming Fei (zhaojun) going to the West

32
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,700
was the hear break of Yuan Emperor's life

33
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,580
chenqie is Huangshang's concubine

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,600
if this happens

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,500
how could the royal son and the princesses

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,800
spend their lives with their heads up?

37
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:23,298
he told Zhen

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,646
he doesn't care these

39
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:27,489
as long as he likes

40
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,766
he can accept anything, not mention it is you

41
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,800
if Muoge had the evil thought because of Chenqie

42
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,700
Chenqie is willing to destroy my face to preserve my integrity

43
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,000
it is not that important if it is only about face

44
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,800
though Qing forced back Zhungeer with plaque

45
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:53,119
it is not certain that

46
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:55,162
they won't find the antidote against the plaque

47
00:02:56,254 --> 00:02:58,254
furthermore, the war is continuous still

48
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:00,306
the vitality of Qing has been undermined greatly

49
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:02,652
Zhen have asked the Treasure

50
00:03:03,246 --> 00:03:05,309
gathering all grains to one place

51
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,674
it provides the military for only three to five months

52
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,000
if the stalemate lasts

53
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,400
it is only getting worse, not better

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Muoge told Zhen in a way that couldn't be more clear

55
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,600
if allow you to be Zhungeer's concubine

56
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,700
and provide the prescription to cure the plague

57
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,600
the big army of Zhungeer will withdraw

58
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,600
and each year

59
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,300
pay him 3000 jin grain,

60
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,261
and 100,000 tael of silver

61
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,700
and never have war with Qing

62
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,600
Chenqie see

63
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,400
Chenqie as a Guifei

64
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,300
have Huangshang's favor for many years

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
this is the time to repaying Huangshang's favor

66
00:04:04,304 --> 00:04:05,910
Chenqie won't dare to protect myself

67
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,700
I'll do what Huangshang wish

68
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,200
Zhen is the Emperor of the country

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
let...

70
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,200
let you decide yourself

71
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:26,836
Chenqie

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,700
wouldn't dare to forget Huangshang's favor

73
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,200
Guifei Niangniang think again, you can't do this

74
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,300
though Xi Guifei niangniang doesn't protect herself

75
00:04:38,884 --> 00:04:40,725
that could put the royal brother in a position of injustice

76
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Prince,

77
00:04:43,547 --> 00:04:46,173
Huangshang hasn't called, and you couldn't come in

78
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,400
Guo Junwang would feel bad if he couldn't finish his words

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,900
Guo Junwang worry too much

80
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:55,406
Bengong is voluteered

81
00:04:56,101 --> 00:04:57,465
Huangshang didn't force me

82
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,100
Niangniang don't want to make it difficult for the royal brother

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,100
but once Ninagniang marries Zhungeer

84
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,100
Royal Brother would be like Han Uuan Emperor

85
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,600
a laughing stuff of the future generation

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,400
but how to reply to Muoge?

87
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,600
Roral Brother, Xi Guifei is the mother of three children

88
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:12,788
her position is high and glorious

89
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,300
if send Xi Guifei to marry other

90
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,300
the princes and the princess

91
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:17,853
ask about their mother in future

92
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,019
how Huang Xiong reply to them?

93
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:22,095
furthermore

94
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:24,135
zhungeer is tens of thousand li away from here

95
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:26,605
if the royal brother miss Xi Guifei

96
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:28,494
it won't be possible to see her again

97
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,500
Huangshang loves Guifei

98
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,200
certainly won't want to use Niangniang's life to maike peace at the border

99
00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:35,132
if Zhungeer really wants to use marriage to make peace

100
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,800
why don't Huangshang choose another beautiful and talented woman to marry Muoge?

101
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:40,876
that would save Niangniang

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,500
and save the face for Muoge

103
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,400
you know

104
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,700
once you love someone, it is extremely difficult to change

105
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,716
since Muoge dares to ask for Xi Guifei

106
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:54,432
he must've determined to get her

107
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,720
you thought that another woman

108
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:01,425
could make Muoge happy and withdraw?

109
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
nothing for you here. go outside

110
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:10,376
either another woman

111
00:06:11,295 --> 00:06:12,120
or Guefei

112
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
it is to sacrifice a woman to protect homeland

113
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,576
what's the difference?

114
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,400
if Zhungeer uses this precedent, asking bribes and women year after year

115
00:06:22,188 --> 00:06:24,101
wouldn't it make women accept cruelty?

116
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,600
where is the integrity of Great Qing?

117
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,500
Chendi thought that this is umproper

118
00:06:32,012 --> 00:06:32,801
it is Zhen

119
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,500
who was deceived

120
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,400
I didn't even know

121
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:40,253
when Muoge noticed Xi Guifei

122
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,300
that put me in a position that no matter what I do would be hard and lose face

123
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:46,338
huang Xiong, it is not that we couldn't beat Zhungeer

124
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,700
do you think Zhen want to give up Xi Guifei?

125
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,800
it is not that we can't fight

126
00:06:57,814 --> 00:06:59,952
but we can't fight like this without ending

127
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,500
the situation now

128
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:06,012
you thought how many good generals Great Qing still has?

129
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,145
in the History of Han, use marriage for peace was the worst strategy they had

130
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,800
if Huang Xiong don't think your younger brother useless

131
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,700
I'm willing to lead army to the West

132
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:22,702
I won't be back without defeating Zhungeer

133
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,500
you told Zhen

134
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:36,791
what you ask is for Great Qing

135
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,227
or for her?

136
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:49,218
Huang Xiong tried so hard

137
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,100
was to make your brother

138
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,700
to say this?

139
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,000
you had been cautious

140
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,500
yet heard that

141
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:08,279
Zhen would allow Xi Guifei marrying to Zhungeer

142
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:09,860
you ran into the palace boldly

143
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,400
in general

144
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:16,082
you had paid little attention to the politics

145
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,900
you knew also that

146
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:21,767
Zhen don't like to have princes to be in charge of army

147
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,800
but for her

148
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,500
you asked Zhen let you lead military to against Zhungeer

149
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,800
Zhen hate self blind before

150
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,526
didn't find out the secret affair between you two

151
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:39,734
Huang Xiong is mistaken

152
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,300
if it is not for your running into the palace

153
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,800
Zhen would never

154
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,600
believe what others said

155
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,700
saying that two of you met secretly outside the forbidden City

156
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,500
and Zhen didn't know anything

157
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,000
you...

158
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:07,238
you are really good

159
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,180
Huang Xiong

160
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,488
Xi Guifei has been following the rules of the harem

161
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,000
Chen Di was careless and impolite

162
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,100
to enter the palace without calling

163
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,600
but Chen Di is a person of Great Qing

164
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,300
couldn't stand the insult imposed

165
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,500
by Zhungeer humiliating us with the demand of the marriage

166
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:26,606
though Chen Di is useless

167
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,800
I am paid as Qin Wang

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,200
I should make my contribution to the country

169
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,300
until death

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,100
you continue

171
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,900
Chen Di understand what Huangshang suspect

172
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:42,975
that's all because Huang Xiong care Xi Guifei so much

173
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:48,085
congratulate to Xi Guifei

174
00:09:50,094 --> 00:09:51,074
yet last tow years

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Zhen heard many gossips

176
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:57,948
saying that since you married Yu Fujin

177
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:01,085
you two are not getting along

178
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
even Huang Xiong have to be bothered by the things in the harem

179
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,000
certainly can understand that

180
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,100
it is not easy to stand between Yuying and Jingxian

181
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,300
deep feeling causes jealousy, and jealousy causes suspicion

182
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:16,608
not getting along

183
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,487
is really feelings too deep

184
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,200
the worst between husband and wife

185
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,900
is suspicion

186
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:29,493
Chenqie is not afraid to suffer for Great Qing

187
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,300
there was the thing of Doctor Wen

188
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,609
Wangye got implicated today

189
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,500
Chenqie couldn't help but feel disheaten

190
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,200
dishearten?

191
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,200
Zhen had a moment of suspicion

192
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,100
the 17th brother

193
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:51,412
married Yuying because of the little portrait

194
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,500
that little portrait

195
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,900
had really resembled Yuyin

196
00:10:56,638 --> 00:10:58,873
but it is okay if saying it resembles you

197
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,600
Zhen won't dare to think further

198
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,000
Huang Xiong really thinks too much

199
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
it is Zhen that thought too much

200
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,300
Xi Guifei is either intentional

201
00:11:16,748 --> 00:11:17,820
or not

202
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,000
she is between our brothers

203
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,400
and caused the attraction of outsiders

204
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,300
is a real evil flood

205
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,500
Zhen will allow the request of Zhengeer

206
00:11:33,657 --> 00:11:35,199
sending her far away from Great Qing

207
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:39,855
marry Zhungeer to make peace

208
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,800
please think over more, Huang Xiong

209
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,105
Zhen have decided, and

210
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,200
won't change

211
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,800
banquet in a Spring day

212
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,400
a cup of green wine and a song

213
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,800
bow again to make three wishes

214
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,300
first is to wish husband living one thousand years

215
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,600
second wish is for me be healthy

216
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,900
third wish is to be swallows on beam

217
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:35,022
see each every year

218
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,600
Chenqie is a deserted woman

219
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:44,867
today I can use my body

220
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:46,711
to serve Huangshang

221
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:49,316
Chenqie couldn't refuse

222
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:55,473
even if couldn't see Huangshang every year

223
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
still hope Huangshang healthy

224
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,000
and living forever

225
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,500
you go out now

226
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:12,900
Yes.

227
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,900
Zhen ask you

228
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,600
what is you plan

229
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:31,507
after allowing the marriage?

230
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,100
Chenqie couldn't take the insult of others

231
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,300
and damage the reputation of Huangshang

232
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,400
Zhen is not Han Yuan Emperor

233
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,600
I don't want you to be Zhaojun who went and never came back

234
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:54,220
even the 17th Prince had some bad intention to you

235
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,800
Zhen wouldn't be really angry with him

236
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,300
everyone likes beauty

237
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:06,632
no wonder they are longing for your beauty

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,600
yet

239
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:13,004
no matter how others admire your beauty

240
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,300
your heart can only be here with Zhen

241
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Huangshang gave an edict last night and said Sister is seriously ill

242
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,700
but not allow to visit

243
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
not only claim she is ill but not allow visit

244
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:39,005
what Huangshang has done is like house arrest

245
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Huangshang intends to use marriage for peace

246
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,400
once Xi Guifei is sent out of the country

247
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,898
Huangshang will held funeral ceremony for Xi Guifei

248
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,700
after that

249
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:56,217
she won't exist in the world

250
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,300
here is Yuanming Yuan, everything is inconvenient

251
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,211
if the 17thi brother's news is accurate

252
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,900
we go back to the House first

253
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,000
discuss there

254
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,300
Huangshang is going back in a few days

255
00:15:14,902 --> 00:15:16,175
we should go back immediately

256
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:25,655
don't know how he is

257
00:15:27,654 --> 00:15:29,901
Niangniang is locked up here and don't know what is happening

258
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,500
still worry about the 17th Prince

259
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,200
I'm afraid that Yunli can't hold back any longer

260
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,200
I bowed Huangshang farewell yesterday

261
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,500
bid Huangshang living thousand years

262
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,300
only hope Yunli

263
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,500
doesn't lose control for me

264
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,700
it doesn't matter what happens to me

265
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,900
don't want to hurt him more

266
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:57,616
this Huangshang

267
00:15:59,146 --> 00:16:00,377
is too cruel

268
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,800
nurture into jade color, sell to royal house

269
00:16:06,997 --> 00:16:08,490
everything including life belongs to Huangshang

270
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,000
so called favor and love

271
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,300
can't compare with the future of the country and the crown

272
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
if I asked Huangshang to pity and protect me

273
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,100
I didn't know how much I was worth

274
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,200
Nubi saw that

275
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,300
Niangniang seems giving up

276
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:30,994
Huangshang has suspected me

277
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,100
between him and me,one person can't be saved

278
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,400
if it is him,

279
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,455
I'd rather be me

280
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,900
Niangniang shouldn't believe such a foolish idea

281
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,700
if fear death

282
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,400
house of the 17th Prince won't be survived

283
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
it's better to let me die

284
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:54,035
Huangshang still cares those children

285
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,300
won't kill them all

286
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
and you thought

287
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,700
if he dies

288
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,900
could I live?

289
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,000
if Niangniang ends as such

290
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,300
Wangye would get the same

291
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:14,216
I'll try my best to protect them

292
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,000
Wangye

293
00:17:45,536 --> 00:17:46,287
don't go

294
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,200
my heart has gone

295
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:54,698
Huangshang is so suspicious

296
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,200
and you have endured for so long

297
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,100
why at this most dangerous time

298
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
you want to risk everything?

299
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,200
you have know and no more questions

300
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,000
you know.

301
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,806
you cares the older sister so much

302
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:15,252
that not care about your own life?

303
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,562
to protect me, she can sacrifice herself

304
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,800
me, too

305
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,400
how could what she did is to protect you?

306
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,000
it is to protect herself

307
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,200
there is only death without the marriage for peace

308
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
she could be live with the marriage

309
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,200
Wangye, didn't you know the temperament of the older sister?

310
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,000
not long after she got the news of your death

311
00:18:36,676 --> 00:18:37,427
she went back to the harem

312
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,000
why don't you for her

313
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,600
still give up your safety and prosperity?

314
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,400
there were difficulties at the time for each of us

315
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,627
don't talk about it

316
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:47,902
between me and Huaner

317
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
we don't give thought about such things

318
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:53,681
if something happens to her

319
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,000
you won't have a good time for the rest of your life

320
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,200
I never begged you before

321
00:19:03,365 --> 00:19:04,496
I beg you this time

322
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:07,042
I beg you with my life

323
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:12,492
though the older sister is my real sister

324
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:15,015
and I'm grateful to her

325
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:18,689
you are my husband

326
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:22,649
you are the only man I love in my life

327
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,100
I'll hurt anyone for you

328
00:19:28,394 --> 00:19:29,557
and not have you been hurt

329
00:19:38,997 --> 00:19:39,626
Yuyin

330
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:42,742
I know I owe you

331
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:45,950
but I can't listen to you

332
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,900
do you think that Huangshang will forgive you if you can get her out?

333
00:19:52,517 --> 00:19:54,112
wake up, Wangye

334
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,900
from the first moment I laid my eyes

335
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,000
on her

336
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,300
I knew there would be a day like this

337
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:11,913
I can't save myself

338
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,832
but I want to save her

339
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:30,658
everything has arranged

340
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,400
the news went out

341
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,500
and the 17th Prince Household thought that Xi Guifei had sent to the marriage for peace

342
00:20:43,237 --> 00:20:44,386
nobody knows

343
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:46,991
in the carriage

344
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,627
there is only a prescription

345
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,175
for the plaque

346
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,300
this Muoge is really audacious,

347
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,200
dares to ask to marry Xi Guifei, and looks down upon the Heavenly Dynasty

348
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,100
the people that can accomplish great things don't sweat on trivial things

349
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,000
and won't be drown in a love affair

350
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,900
Zhen said only to give him a prescription for the plaque

351
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
he understood

352
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,100
but Muoge has been denied that

353
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:17,444
there is any secret affair between Guo Junwant and Xi Guifei

354
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,700
Muoge takes side with Xi Guifei, couldn't Zhen see it?

355
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:27,745
the most outrageous is Guo Junwang

356
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,500
who dares to eye on his royal sister-in-law

357
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,200
a disloyal heart

358
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,100
Zhen know you are effective; now it is up to Yunli

359
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,100
whether he'll pursue her to the West

360
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:48,125
if he does

361
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,700
that would be true that he pursued Zhen's woman

362
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,700
Nucai will have someone watching Xi Guifei

363
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,100
there won't be any leak

364
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:01,685
good

365
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,000
for Muoge leaving the capital

366
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:07,748
sent out the order.

367
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,400
going back to the Palace tomorrow

368
00:22:15,707 --> 00:22:16,253
the 17th Prince,

369
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:17,693
you go without worry

370
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,500
every here Yurao and I won't tell anyone for now

371
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,500
hide now, can't hide forever

372
00:22:26,015 --> 00:22:27,058
it will get you in trouble

373
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,554
17th Brother, take care

374
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,813
brothers

375
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,765
you are my close soldiers and guards

376
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,100
this trip to the West is dangeous

377
00:22:44,184 --> 00:22:45,872
I'm afraid that I may not come back

378
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:47,970
but I still ask you

379
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,500
to help me

380
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:51,660
it is me

381
00:22:52,911 --> 00:22:53,829
that owe you all apologies

382
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,118
Nucai want to follow Wangye

383
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,400
protect you with all we have, live or die

384
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,459
what has happened?

385
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,418
a person down there reported that

386
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,900
the 17th Prince with his people is pursuing out of the capital

387
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,300
Longyue is taller

388
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:23,178
come over, let Royal Father take a look

389
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,900
what is going on?

390
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,600
the Princess grows up, and has ideas

391
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,500
she heard that Hongyan and Lingxi are ill the day before yesterday

392
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,400
she wanted to go to see the brother and the sister

393
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,900
who would know that she couldn't sleep and worried after she came back

394
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,300
Zhen had seen Hongyan and Lingxi

395
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,000
doctor said that the illness were caused by upset stomach and worries

396
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,400
where are the worries from for such little person?

397
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
it must be the people there that didn't serve well

398
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,600
Zhen had scolded their wet nurses

399
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,300
Hongyan and Lingxi haven't seen their mother for a long time,

400
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,900
they miss her very much

401
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,200
I heard that Mother is seriously ill and couldn't get out of bed

402
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,700
Longyue couldn't ease the pain of brother and sister for missing Mother

403
00:25:14,812 --> 00:25:17,616
could neither do my filial devotion at Mother's bed

404
00:25:18,112 --> 00:25:19,275
that's why I am sad

405
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,000
Jing Niangniang and other mothers

406
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:31,131
love you very much

407
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,100
Longyue know

408
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,000
yesterday Lingyue read "Mencius"

409
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,000
Mengzi said that

410
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,460
first happiness is that parents are alive and brothers have no problems

411
00:25:44,882 --> 00:25:48,737
second happiness is that being worthy of Heaven and others on Earth

412
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,000
the third happiness is to educate talents

413
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,400
Longyue wish to be Junzi, be fijial to Royal Father and mother, take care of younger brother and sister

414
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:23,466
something bothers Huangshang?

415
00:26:24,697 --> 00:26:26,200
you haven't slept well for a few days

416
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:28,481
nothing. go to sleep

417
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,200
Xi Guifei is recuperating at Bitong Study

418
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,700
Huangshang have been worrying about her

419
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,700
let's take Sister Xi back

420
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,900
Chenqie know that

421
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,300
Huangshang care Sister Xi very much

422
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,300
go to sleep

423
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
though Huangshang let Niangniang back

424
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,900
that the 17th Prince went to the West for Niangniang is not over

425
00:27:20,803 --> 00:27:23,199
I'm afraid that Huangshang will blame and question Niangninag more

426
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,706
even he let me back to the harem

427
00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:31,491
look this Yongshou Palace, not even a ghost here

428
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:35,696
everyone thought that I was still at the Yuanming Garden

429
00:27:37,092 --> 00:27:38,450
if I died at this moment

430
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,800
who would know?

431
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,500
Huangshang must've wanted to hear Niangniang

432
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,500
that's why he calls you to Yangxin Palace

433
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,400
Niangniang have to prepare for it early

434
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,200
Huangshang, Xi Guifei is here

435
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:24,981
Chenqie is well now,

436
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,200
special greetings to Huangshang

437
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,400
it was not a big deal that you were ill

438
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:34,064
but Guo Junwant thought that you married for peach

439
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,900
and dared to take his men to the West

440
00:28:42,135 --> 00:28:43,495
Xi Guifei

441
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,700
his feeling to you is really not shallow

442
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,000
Chenqie should be died for ten thousand times for the crime,

443
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,900
and didn't even know that such thing happened

444
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,400
you deserve to die

445
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,900
can you say anything to defending yourself?

446
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,200
Guo Junwant was reckless to go to the West

447
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:02,546
but he did it for preserving the integrity of Great Qing

448
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,700
yet chasing the root

449
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,100
it was still caused by Chenqie

450
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,300
Chenqie is willing to take punishment by Huangshang

451
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,900
Zhen will punish you, of course

452
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,500
Chenqie submit to the order of Heaven

453
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,000
it is not only this one thing that Zhen want to punish you

454
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:29,703
several crimes, that make difficult for Zhen not to know where to start

455
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,700
Zhen saw you got leaner

456
00:29:35,793 --> 00:29:38,951
you must've thought over your mistakes at Yuanming Garden

457
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:43,900
alright,

458
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,400
Su Peisheng

459
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,500
take Xi Guifei back to her palace

460
00:29:53,306 --> 00:29:54,732
go to see your children

461
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,100
they miss you very much these days you were sick

462
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,400
Chenqie leave

463
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,600
Niangniang

464
00:30:53,424 --> 00:30:55,020
go to greet your father

465
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,900
Huangshang, use some almond tea to moist your throat

466
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,700
Su Peisheng

467
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,000
Zhen forgave Xi Guifei as such

468
00:31:27,347 --> 00:31:28,943
whether or not that would spoil her?

469
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,988
Huangshang, forgive Nucai to say something that I shouldn't

470
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,100
this has nothing to do with Xi Guifei

471
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:46,546
this is the fault of Yunli

472
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,200
he had his eyes on the concubine of Emperor, and went out of the capital without order

473
00:31:52,983 --> 00:31:54,513
rebelliously amoral

474
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:58,544
Guo Junwant won't dare to be against Huangshang

475
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,200
Junli had submit his memorial

476
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,100
admitted his crime of leading a troop without permission

477
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,000
asking the punishment of guarding the border and enduring the harsh life of wind and sand

478
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,200
it is good that Guo Junwant doesn't come back

479
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,600
so that it won't cause the anger of Huangshang if Huangshang don't have to see him

480
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,900
what do you know

481
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,100
Zhen have to endure gossip if I punish him for this

482
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:24,293
and cause speculations on the harem

483
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:28,483
he wants punishment, Zhen want to award him

484
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,200
send my edict

485
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,900
Guo Junwang and Shen Beile are loyal to Emperor and defend the country

486
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,300
promote Guo junwant to Guo Qinwant

487
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,900
Shen Baile to Shen Junwang

488
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,400
Guo Qinwant stations outside of the Yanmen Pass

489
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,300
can't come back to the capital

490
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,800
without Emperor's order

491
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:50,900
obey the order

492
00:32:54,413 --> 00:32:56,030
Three Years Later

493
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,100
beautiful flowers and full moon is easy to have

494
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,920
people cannot be together for long

495
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,500
Huan'er, at this moment

496
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,700
I hope, under this bright moonlight, you are safe and happy

497
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:53,001
these letters are true?

498
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,600
is it confirmed that is his handwriting?

499
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,300
it's confirmed

500
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,700
it was when Cucai greeted Yu Fujin that I stole

501
00:34:02,236 --> 00:34:03,248
from the lower drawer of her dressing table

502
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,100
are these all?

503
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,000
Nucai were afraid to be discovered that were all I took

504
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,300
How is Guo Qinwang?

505
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,640
Huangshang, Guo Qinwang stations in Yanming Pass for three years, and

506
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,453
Zhunge'er didn't invade at all

507
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,700
Wangye guards the border, runs the army with strict disciplines

508
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,700
eats and sleeps with officers and soldiers, and didn't show any arrogance because of royalty

509
00:34:35,243 --> 00:34:37,943
officers and soldiers all love him without exception

510
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:40,107
he wants to bribe for love of mass?

511
00:34:41,082 --> 00:34:42,018
Chen guess that

512
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,792
maybe Wangye doesn't want to be the talk of others

513
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,000
Zhen have seen his memorial

514
00:34:48,871 --> 00:34:51,612
saying that Spring wind won't across Yumen Pass

515
00:34:53,565 --> 00:34:55,364
life in the Pass is harsh and cold

516
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,698
ask Zhen to care about the officers, soldiers, and the people at the border

517
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,300
reset Hu shi

518
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,221
let the people prosperous

519
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:10,420
what Guo Qinwang said is reasonable

520
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,591
it is reasonable though it is unnecessary for him to say

521
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,600
Zhen want him to guard the border, not involve in local politics

522
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,400
don't be angry, Huangshang

523
00:35:23,514 --> 00:35:26,409
the medicine the doctor gave you

524
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,000
you have to avoid anger if taking it

525
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,200
three years

526
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:41,987
call him back to the capital

527
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,000
Mother, Look, dragonfly, red dragonfly

528
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,700
Lingxi, look

529
00:36:12,214 --> 00:36:13,888
the lotuses on the lake are blooming

530
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,800
why do there only lotuses on the lake not other flowers?

531
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,800
because

532
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:21,974
the fragrance of the lotus is pure and sufficient

533
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,500
the fragrance of other flowers would make it worse

534
00:36:36,692 --> 00:36:39,614
Lingxi, this is your 17th uncle

535
00:36:39,882 --> 00:36:41,049
hello, 17th uncle

536
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:44,973
Lingxi grows so much

537
00:36:49,018 --> 00:36:52,698
heard Wangye was coming back, didn't expect you were back so soon

538
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,900
I haven't been in the capital for a long time

539
00:36:57,206 --> 00:36:59,804
my heart was like a flying arrow, and I came back nonstop

540
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,000
hadn't seen Xi Guifei for a long time

541
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,400
how are you doing?

542
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,972
with Wangye's blessing, I am doing well

543
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,200
have you seen Yuyin and Yunche?

544
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,700
I rushed to see Emperor to report my job and haven't be back to my house

545
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,314
I'll arrange someone to get them here immediately

546
00:37:30,617 --> 00:37:32,007
the wind, the bitterness, and hardship at the Pass

547
00:37:33,154 --> 00:37:34,384
every time Yuyin talked about it

548
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:37,217
we worried

549
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,052
thanks for the concerns of Xi Guifei

550
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,300
I had been written to Yuyin

551
00:37:43,863 --> 00:37:45,016
so that she would worry less

552
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:47,000
everything is fine

553
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:48,900
Wangye

554
00:37:50,888 --> 00:37:52,969
Nucai found you finally

555
00:37:54,031 --> 00:37:55,592
Xi Guifei is happy

556
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,400
Wangye is happy

557
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,020
Huangshang is waiting for you

558
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,300
he waited, and waited, and worried, hurry up

559
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,900
I am going

560
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:16,388
Huangshang cares about his brother, send Nucai to have a look in particular

561
00:38:32,212 --> 00:38:33,010
come

562
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,337
the 17th

563
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,650
give Zhen one true word

564
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,000
be blown by the wind of the border for three years

565
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,800
whom did you miss the most?

566
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:01,917
Mother

567
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,500
your brother is not a filial child

568
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,800
you dared to let a troop to leave the capital

569
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,800
you remembered your mother?

570
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,500
Chen Di have filial devotion, royal brother have, too

571
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,700
Huang Xiong is a wise emperor

572
00:39:27,288 --> 00:39:29,227
certainly wouldn't blame Mother and Yuyin

573
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,400
for Chen Di's fault

574
00:39:35,288 --> 00:39:37,082
go out, all of you

575
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:47,297
the 17th

576
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,500
you tell Zhen one true word

577
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,900
did you do anything improper with Xi Guifei?
