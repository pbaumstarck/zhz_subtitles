00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,794
<i> ~ Episode 74 ~</i>

2
00:00:10,517 --> 00:00:11,584
Seventeen,

3
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:15,192
tell me a true fact.

4
00:00:20,268 --> 00:00:24,732
Did you and Concubine Xi have any illicit relationship?

5
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:29,334
For her,

6
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:32,482
you have been living out there in the blowing wind for 3 years.

7
00:00:33,343 --> 00:00:36,325
is it because of her, you also want to steal my throne?

8
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,067
ehh?

9
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,917
all of the wrong-doings,

10
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:47,071
are my fault.

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:55,193
Imperial Brother, i have nothing.

12
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:58,792
We did not.

13
00:01:00,488 --> 00:01:01,469
I am the Emperor.

14
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:04,970
naturally, you shouldn't have anything!

15
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,832
You don't deserve it!

16
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:21,409
Niang Niang,

17
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:23,148
The Emperor's eunuch Xiao Xiazi is here

18
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:24,473
Let him in

19
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,724
Yes

20
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:31,676
Servant greets Precious Consort Xi

21
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:32,708
Get up

22
00:01:33,797 --> 00:01:35,761
The Emperor is waiting for Niang Niang at Jiu Zhou Qing Hall

23
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,418
Please go over there immediately

24
00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:38,905
Alright

25
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:46,321
Your Majesty, Precious Consort Xi is here

26
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,208
Greetings and peace to the Emperor

27
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:52,240
Rise

28
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:56,119
You can go now.

29
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,120
Yes.

30
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:06,884
Your head is covered with sweat.

31
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:26,020
You've been in the Palace all these years...

32
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,257
This is first time I hit you after you have been in the Palace for all these years.

33
00:02:28,984 --> 00:02:31,758
Your Majesty want to hit me, I will of course endure it.

34
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:35,145
What did I do wrong?

35
00:02:36,677 --> 00:02:38,613
Let me understand what's wrong.

36
00:02:38,613 --> 00:02:39,668
Will tell you.

37
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,397
When Yunli returned you were especially happy...

38
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:46,427
I was happy because of Yuyi (her sister)

39
00:02:48,026 --> 00:02:51,095
Unlike me who has husband on my side every day.

40
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:53,553
She can only wait up with a single candle on her own each night.

41
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:55,600
I hoped when Prince Guo came back...

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,642
to rekindle their couple love.

43
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,153
Therefore,

44
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:02,170
I have already sent for her and her son.

45
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,567
Is it you waiting for Yunli or Yuyi (her sister) is?

46
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:07,768
You know the answer in your heart.

47
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:09,675
I am selfish.

48
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:12,799
I didn't want Prince Guo to come back.

49
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:16,971
Because of Prince Guo's return to the palace...

50
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:18,773
Your Majesty would doubt me as your wife.

51
00:03:18,773 --> 00:03:20,566
The Palace will loose its peace.

52
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:22,990
I have doubt?!

53
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:27,060
I have no choice to avoid him.

54
00:03:28,477 --> 00:03:31,496
From youth, Your Highness (my father) have especially loved the 17th Prince.

55
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:33,660
If not because of all the subject were against it back then,

56
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,954
today the person who sits on this throne in the Palace

57
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:37,126
would not be me.

58
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:42,229
Besides, in literature, riding or aerial shooting,

59
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:45,033
he was taught by Your Highness. (the previous Emperor)

60
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:46,900
He is better than me on everything.

61
00:03:48,163 --> 00:03:49,758
Now that I let him lead the army

62
00:03:51,175 --> 00:03:54,267
What if he had a different heart like my tenth brother.

63
00:03:57,753 --> 00:03:59,158
I have to be careful

64
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:01,810
Emperor, Prince Guo is not capable of such...

65
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:03,346
You are not him.

66
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:04,631
How to you know what's in his heart and his thoughts?

67
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:08,247
Does he tell you everything ?

68
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,872
I knew long time ago

69
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:13,631
that he inappropriate feelings for you.

70
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:16,910
I do not dare

71
00:04:17,818 --> 00:04:19,152
I am just guessing.

72
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,230
Prince Guo has always had the respect for Your Majesty.

73
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:24,803
For anyone who has the most respect,

74
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:27,638
once they have power in their hands, it is always possible that they will have a different heart.

75
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:30,687
Besides,

76
00:04:31,657 --> 00:04:33,992
Your Highness (the previous Emperor) has wanted to hand over his power.

77
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:38,838
Hard to say that he might have wrong <br>thoughts about the throne

78
00:04:42,678 --> 00:04:45,003
The royal family has brotherhood

79
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:46,564
as well as the civil being

80
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:50,101
King wants me dead <br> I will have to die

81
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:51,884
Your Majesty

82
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:54,553
Emperor, Prince Guo is your younger brother.

83
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:56,491
That day

84
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,393
when my mother and I decided to go after the throne,

85
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:02,992
even #14 prince was part of it.

86
00:05:03,628 --> 00:05:05,825
I've forgotten about having any brothers.

87
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,730
These few years...

88
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:13,757
I have treated him very well.

89
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,961
It is extra reward for him.

90
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,509
Your Majesty, please think carefully.

91
00:05:23,461 --> 00:05:26,452
Prince Guo has done lots by leading the army and did not make any mistakes.

92
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,704
If Your Majesty really want to get rid of him,

93
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,110
I am afraid your integrity will be damaged.

94
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:50,745
You have never disppointted me.

95
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,267
So this time,

96
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:57,076
I am asking you to do it this time.

97
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:02,087
I must wipe out the 17th prince .

98
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:05,899
I'm giving you an opportunity...

99
00:06:07,961 --> 00:06:10,839
Your actions will demonstrate

100
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,423
that you do not have selfish motives.

101
00:06:26,192 --> 00:06:27,847
Its all arranged...

102
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:32,945
your meeting with him at the Lotus Flower Pavilion.

103
00:06:33,988 --> 00:06:35,198
you take this and go there

104
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:37,953
I will be waiting for good news from you.

105
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:50,338
Let me change my outfit first.

106
00:06:53,221 --> 00:06:54,439
You don't need to change clothes

107
00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:04,183
My Huan Huan is always this pretty

108
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,970
If I were the 17th Prince,

109
00:07:10,616 --> 00:07:13,342
I would be willing

110
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:15,959
to drink the poisonous wine you offer.

111
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:21,852
Little Xia Zi,

112
00:07:22,672 --> 00:07:25,027
bring Xi Consort to the Lotus Flower Pavilion.

113
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:26,399
Yes.

114
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,245
After it is done,

115
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:35,167
Hong Yan will definately be the Crown Prince with no problem.

116
00:07:38,186 --> 00:07:40,671
Because he has a

117
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:47,207
mother who I can trust but also is very capable.

118
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:01,677
Once Noble Conssort Xi has learn Prince was coming back,

119
00:08:01,677 --> 00:08:04,075
She ask me to come get you and your son.

120
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:05,725
So the whole family can be reunion.

121
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,437
Big Sister is very good to us

122
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:09,573
Of course

123
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:12,542
Niang niang naturally hopes that Wangye...

124
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,498
and Fujin to have a harmonious marriage.

125
00:08:14,498 --> 00:08:17,876
Her actions...

126
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:19,210
can be counted as giving me her blessings.

127
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:25,929
Yuan Che, you haven't seen your father for three years.

128
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:28,126
when you see him, remember to call him Father.

129
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:29,130
Yes.

130
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,890
He will surely be happy to see his Father

131
00:08:34,217 --> 00:08:37,867
If only he would remember his wife and son.

132
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:58,357
Peace upon Your Majesty.

133
00:08:58,357 --> 00:09:00,867
Wangye, it is Consort Xi who has arrived.

134
00:09:02,357 --> 00:09:03,527
Oh? It was His Majesty who said to meet here.

135
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:05,367
His Majesty has not recovered from his hangover.

136
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:07,727
He ask for Consort Xi to provide some company first.

137
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:09,907
His Majesty will come after he has refreshed himself.

138
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,277
I'll have to trouble you then, Consort Xi.

139
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:15,567
Wangye, there's no need to be so courteous.

140
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:28,967
This is fine wine that has been bestowed by His Majesty.

141
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,917
Niang Niang, please accompany him.

142
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:35,547
I'll escort His Majesty over.

143
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:50,127
It's such a rare opportunity to drink with you, Wangye.

144
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:54,017
It's just like the old times. It's still summer.

145
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:56,917
You still like to dress like a royal wife.

146
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:01,617
Flower copper top <br> has been lonely for many years

147
00:10:03,157 --> 00:10:06,497
Only the sun regularly visits

148
00:10:06,547 --> 00:10:09,127
Consort Xi, do you still remember your words from the old days?

149
00:10:10,637 --> 00:10:14,647
Yugao Flower is just a flower for a night

150
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:17,947
Just like something that neither be accepted by people

151
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,777
nor the world

152
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,157
Even though they are rejected by the general public

153
00:10:24,217 --> 00:10:25,697
and the world

154
00:10:26,947 --> 00:10:29,277
Things will still remain deep inside my heart

155
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:37,867
Will there eventually come a day when

156
00:10:37,877 --> 00:10:41,067
people consider Yugao Flower as an eyesore,

157
00:10:42,677 --> 00:10:45,587
and then strip all leaves of it？

158
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:49,127
Perhaps.

159
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:51,617
Even if you pluck the Yugao Flower

160
00:10:51,707 --> 00:10:54,057
the things that remain inside of it

161
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:56,347
will never be removed

162
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:07,277
Wangye.

163
00:11:07,357 --> 00:11:09,487
All these years,

164
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,407
you've worked hard at the borders.

165
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:19,157
Have you ever heard of this saying, Consort Xi?

166
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,117
May we all be blessed with longevity

167
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:24,747
Though far apart, we are still able to share the beauty of the moon together.

168
00:11:27,557 --> 00:11:29,787
When I think of the moon that we share together

169
00:11:29,827 --> 00:11:32,767
would illuminate on healthy people

170
00:11:34,557 --> 00:11:36,687
It is worthy of my hard work

171
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:40,847
Before I work in palace,

172
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:43,177
I have been to Lingyun Peak

173
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,537
The mountain and the river,

174
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,337
It was all the same as in the past.

175
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,097
I'm afraid that in this life,

176
00:11:55,137 --> 00:11:58,077
I will never get the chance to go back there again.

177
00:11:58,147 --> 00:11:59,967
Have you ever thought of returning?

178
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:02,337
Wangye, would you believe me?

179
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:07,007
I've returned many times in my dreams.

180
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:10,367
It's as if everything is as it were in the past.

181
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:12,327
Nothing changed at all.

182
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:14,747
But when I awaken from my dream,

183
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:17,617
I'm just left with hurt feelings.

184
00:12:24,347 --> 00:12:26,357
The best moments in my life...

185
00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:29,427
are just in Ling Yun Feng.

186
00:12:35,897 --> 00:12:37,327
Tonight is the 17th. The moon isn't even round anymore.

187
00:12:43,757 --> 00:12:46,417
Do you still remember the marriage certificate?

188
00:12:46,527 --> 00:12:48,397
I do.

189
00:12:50,677 --> 00:12:52,007
There was a certificate,

190
00:12:52,017 --> 00:12:55,127
but we never shared a wedding toast.

191
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,717
Then tonight...

192
00:13:06,757 --> 00:13:10,757
allow me to be impudent this once.

193
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:26,607
The winds are strong tonight. <br>Close the windows first.

194
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:46,877
Look at the picture on the window.

195
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:49,157
Is it especially current?

196
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:52,277
This is a pattern of He Huan Flower

197
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:56,087
The colour of golden red like this

198
00:13:56,157 --> 00:13:58,487
Isn't it seem like we are in the wedding season?

199
00:14:02,017 --> 00:14:03,717
Mother like this type of flower,

200
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:06,927
Dad once said when building this Tonghua Tai

201
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:09,377
that windows should all be decorated with this kind of flower

202
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:15,957
He Huan means gentle and forever

203
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:18,567
Wasn't Ninghui Tang you lived before

204
00:14:18,617 --> 00:14:20,627
full of He Huan Flower?

205
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,937
It's just a pity

206
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:29,597
that no matter how much ather adores mother

207
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:32,787
he can never only be with her forever

208
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:35,637
Neither can I

209
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:40,137
I own Jingxian a big apology

210
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:42,077
As well as Yuyin

211
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:48,477
And even, you

212
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:52,397
Don't say such things. I understand it.

213
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:56,617
Maybe if we went back to the past,

214
00:14:56,717 --> 00:14:59,507
we would all regret the choices we made then.

215
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:02,947
Perhaps if we change our paths,

216
00:15:02,957 --> 00:15:06,577
we wouldn't even be trapped <br>in this difficult position like today

217
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:10,087
What I regret most...

218
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:13,127
is going to Ganlu Temple...

219
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:16,207
to announce the edict and welcoming you back to the palace.

220
00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:24,277
Huan Er, that is the single unforgivable mistake I made in this life.

221
00:15:29,677 --> 00:15:32,347
Even though I always have feelings for you

222
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:35,827
but I have to restrain myself

223
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:40,087
Everything is predestined

224
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:42,657
I will not hold it against you.

225
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,687
The only one that I have been longing for throughout my entire life,

226
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:52,707
Not only can I not have her,

227
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:57,247
but also let two other ladies down

228
00:15:59,217 --> 00:16:04,547
I am horrible

229
00:16:04,637 --> 00:16:08,387
This is the place where the last emperor and Concort Shu kept their precious memories

230
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:12,287
Don't say such depressing things here.

231
00:16:12,357 --> 00:16:15,497
But I'm afraid that if I don't say it now, <br>I'll never get the chance to.

232
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,607
-Nonsense.<br>-Isn't it?

233
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:24,807
Every time I see you, it's at a palace banquet.

234
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:27,357
Even getting close to you is so hard.

235
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,417
Where would we get the chance to speak these words?

236
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,017
- scene -

237
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:35,387
Over tens of years in one's life

238
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:38,317
already have passed by

239
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:41,697
I've never had the opportunity to tell you.

240
00:16:44,017 --> 00:16:48,757
You're already a father, <br>and you still speak without restraint?

241
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:57,417
I'm just afraid that I'll miss the chance again.

242
00:16:59,347 --> 00:17:01,147
I'm sorry.

243
00:17:01,227 --> 00:17:03,597
I refuse to hear such words.

244
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:16,877
What if I say

245
00:17:16,947 --> 00:17:19,617
Wish you two can be together until death do you apart

246
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:37,197
We will have a harmonious<br> husband and wife relationship forever

247
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:50,157
Look, I've finished drinking mine.

248
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:15,207
When it comes to cross-cupped wine,

249
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:18,897
I never had anything left in cup

250
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:22,577
I want to tell you,

251
00:18:22,627 --> 00:18:27,497
In this lifetime of mine, <br>to be able to have this moment...

252
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:30,677
I have no other regrets.

253
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:59,527
Ah Jin!

254
00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:01,907
Ah Jin!

255
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:08,157
Why hasn't Wangye returned yet? <br>I want to go take a look.

256
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:10,617
Wanye is drinking at Tong Hua Tai

257
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:13,917
-I'm going to take a look.<br>-It might not be appropriate for you to go, Madam.

258
00:19:13,957 --> 00:19:16,067
Don't stop me.

259
00:19:17,627 --> 00:19:19,277
Huan Er.

260
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:24,007
Let me hug you once more.

261
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:37,087
If I'm no longer around,

262
00:19:37,157 --> 00:19:39,727
Will you treat Yu Ying well

263
00:19:39,797 --> 00:19:41,617
Of course.

264
00:19:41,717 --> 00:19:44,687
If it were you,

265
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,717
you would do the same.

266
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:53,687
When Hongyan was young, <br>he was very mischievous.

267
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:56,087
And yet, he was very sharp.

268
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:58,917
Unlike Ling Xi

269
00:19:59,437 --> 00:20:02,097
who have been stable and lively since a young age

270
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,627
Their moves and sounds,

271
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,247
Their personalities are not like twins at all.

272
00:20:13,627 --> 00:20:16,697
I want to go back to Ling Yun Feng

273
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:23,377
Yunli, what's wrong with you?

274
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:28,177
The cup of poisoned wine was clearly mine!

275
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:30,757
You switched the cups, didn't you?

276
00:20:33,087 --> 00:20:36,497
A wine flask that's divided into a poisoned and un-poisoned section

277
00:20:38,357 --> 00:20:42,237
I'm not unaware of the schemes in the palace.

278
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:48,417
I know what kind of person Brother is. <br>He had you come alone in the night...

279
00:20:49,157 --> 00:20:50,827
I felt that it was unusual.

280
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:53,827
When I asked you to close the window,

281
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:57,227
I switched the wine goblets.

282
00:20:59,297 --> 00:21:00,637
Huan Er.

283
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:03,297
I refuse to make it difficult for you.

284
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,827
Spit the wine out!

285
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:11,397
I'll call the Imperial Physician.<br>Yunli! Yunli!

286
00:21:11,887 --> 00:21:14,037
Yunli.

287
00:21:15,627 --> 00:21:19,597
Ever since I took my soldiers to save you,

288
00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:22,807
Older Brother's threatening to kill

289
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:25,687
I long have been unable to run

290
00:21:29,337 --> 00:21:36,287
If this drink was really from you

291
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:38,827
it won't even matter

292
00:21:38,877 --> 00:21:42,477
That's because you are choosing to protect yourself.

293
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:47,047
Huan Er, from today on,

294
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,447
I cannot protect you anymore.

295
00:21:52,757 --> 00:21:54,567
You must...

296
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:58,307
you must know how to protect yourself, alright?

297
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:03,777
No. I am the one who was supposed to die!

298
00:22:03,827 --> 00:22:07,577
If I died, you'd still have a means to survive.

299
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:10,217
Imperial Brother wants me dead.

300
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,217
How can I still survive?

301
00:22:13,277 --> 00:22:17,217
I don't want you to die!

302
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:19,087
Yunli!

303
00:22:36,827 --> 00:22:41,057
The child, Hongyan, really resembles you.

304
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:43,817
You have your child.

305
00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:47,357
You must live on well.

306
00:22:52,377 --> 00:22:56,067
I beg of you, don't leave me.

307
00:22:56,547 --> 00:22:59,637
I'm your wife. Take me away from this palace!<br>I don't want to remain here!

308
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:01,917
I don't want to remain here!

309
00:23:01,957 --> 00:23:04,517
I beg you to take me away from here!

310
00:23:07,147 --> 00:23:10,197
With this sentiment of yours,

311
00:23:10,203 --> 00:23:17,434
I have no regrets in this life.

312
00:23:21,437 --> 00:23:22,397
Yunli.

313
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:31,548
In my heart...

314
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:38,707
you've always been my one and only...

315
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:43,167
wife.

316
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:55,593
I never told you...

317
00:23:55,593 --> 00:24:02,646
Hongyan and Lingxi both are yours...

318
00:24:29,057 --> 00:24:30,697
Niang Niang, you've come out?

319
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,497
Who's there?

320
00:24:42,097 --> 00:24:46,447
If the Niang Niang came out, I will read the Royal Edict.

321
00:24:46,497 --> 00:24:49,087
But if besides Niang Niang, there were someone else came out,

322
00:24:50,637 --> 00:24:53,057
I was told to kill Niang Niang and the other person/people. No matter who the person is.

323
00:24:53,147 --> 00:24:55,617
the person would be executed on the spot.

324
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:00,417
I'm fine.

325
00:25:00,497 --> 00:25:02,457
I've come out.

326
00:25:02,527 --> 00:25:04,597
Then...

327
00:25:07,247 --> 00:25:09,217
Prince Guo...has passed away.

328
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:14,907
Please read the Royal Edict.

329
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,817
Gui Fei, please knee to receive the Royal Edict.

330
00:25:24,777 --> 00:25:27,667
By royal edict of the Emperor,

331
00:25:27,747 --> 00:25:30,647
The palace is full of misconduct <br> Your majesty feels there's no owner of the palaces

332
00:25:30,707 --> 00:25:34,307
Assign Royal Xi as head of the 6 palaces

333
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:36,457
Position same as Queen

334
00:25:36,637 --> 00:25:37,947
End of edict.

335
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:42,797
Niang Niang, this is a great news.

336
00:25:50,737 --> 00:25:55,077
His Majesty knew that you'd be tired, Niang Niang.<br>So he had me escort you back to your chambers.

337
00:26:10,857 --> 00:26:12,817
Where's Wangye?

338
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:14,767
Inside.

339
00:26:22,407 --> 00:26:24,357
-Wangye!<br>-The flower has fallen.

340
00:26:27,357 --> 00:26:29,177
Niang Niang!

341
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:32,527
Your Majesty.

342
00:26:33,957 --> 00:26:35,617
Prince Guo has passed away suddenly.

343
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:37,667
The matter is concluded.

344
00:26:39,627 --> 00:26:43,467
I have follow Your Majesty's order and sent <br> Prince's body back to the boarder in secret.

345
00:26:43,817 --> 00:26:46,987
So the public would think Prince Quo had<br> returned to the border

346
00:26:47,077 --> 00:26:48,347
Ok and,

347
00:26:50,887 --> 00:26:54,557
The weather is hot. <br>It's not convenient to delay it for too long.

348
00:26:59,377 --> 00:27:01,627
I remember that when I was young,

349
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:05,037
my Mother wasn't favored.

350
00:27:06,507 --> 00:27:09,187
Father didn't like me either.

351
00:27:11,857 --> 00:27:15,127
Among all the brothers, <br>only the 13th and 17th...

352
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:17,197
were close to me.

353
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:20,027
That is precisely why...

354
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:22,677
Prince Guo's crime cannot be pardoned!

355
00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:24,227
Has Your Majesty forgotten?

356
00:27:24,307 --> 00:27:26,787
The letters that I secretly found in Prince Guo's residence...

357
00:27:26,987 --> 00:27:29,297
were all filled with secret language between<br> husband and wife.

358
00:27:31,027 --> 00:27:33,217
He did deserve death.

359
00:27:33,257 --> 00:27:37,027
But I cannot ignore our brotherly bond either.

360
00:27:39,547 --> 00:27:41,547
I would like to give the prince a very big funeral.

361
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:47,327
Have his mourning carried out with lots of pomp.

362
00:27:48,977 --> 00:27:51,257
In order to protect the peace at the boarder,

363
00:27:51,327 --> 00:27:53,627
don't make it too big.

364
00:27:53,697 --> 00:27:55,767
Your Majesty is definitely right.

365
00:27:55,817 --> 00:28:01,657
I wonder if Gui Fei Ci was too surprised and <br> sad so she fell from the stairs.

366
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:06,977
The Doctor said her knee was injured quite seriously. <br> It would take a few days to heal before she can walk.

367
00:28:07,077 --> 00:28:09,267
Sadness costs the scared.

368
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:16,947
It's really too hard on her.

369
00:28:23,097 --> 00:28:27,497
Niang Niang has been sick for a few days now. <br> Your Majesty has not been here once.

370
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:29,997
What does that matter?

371
00:28:31,807 --> 00:28:34,307
He has done what he set out to do?

372
00:28:35,597 --> 00:28:38,697
Even my title has been bestowed.

373
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:40,597
Physician Wei said...

374
00:28:40,707 --> 00:28:43,527
that your right knee was too seriously injured.

375
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:46,617
I'm afraid...

376
00:28:46,697 --> 00:28:50,467
I'm afraid you won't be able to dance anymore.

377
00:28:50,537 --> 00:28:53,567
Mother said...

378
00:28:54,497 --> 00:28:59,197
that the Crane Dance is to be performed<br> for the man you love.

379
00:29:02,397 --> 00:29:05,197
Indeed, I don't need to dance anymore.

380
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:11,497
Niang Niang, it's time to drink your medicine.

381
00:29:21,257 --> 00:29:23,067
Naturally, I should take my medicine.

382
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:29,197
I have promised him to live well.

383
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,597
Jin Xi

384
00:29:46,997 --> 00:29:49,797
Tomorrow is his funeral procession.

385
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:54,367
-Yes.<br>-I really want to send him off.

386
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:59,997
What did I do to deserve having him save me...

387
00:30:00,137 --> 00:30:03,227
and give up his life for me?

388
00:30:04,797 --> 00:30:07,797
I loved him my whole life.

389
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:11,837
I let him down my whole life too.

390
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:16,697
Now, he's died for me.

391
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:21,467
And I can't even have a good cry for him.

392
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:14,697
I want Father! I want Father!

393
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:17,537
You mustn't cry. You cannot cry!

394
00:31:19,097 --> 00:31:22,797
His Majesty has granted special favour to allow the funeral ceremony.

395
00:31:22,897 --> 00:31:26,097
His Majesty's edict stated that no sound of crying is to be heard!

396
00:31:30,877 --> 00:31:34,037
His Majesty has done such a unrighteousness thing.

397
00:31:34,127 --> 00:31:36,027
Naturally, he doesn't want people talking about it.

398
00:31:36,097 --> 00:31:37,997
Asking us not to make a sound when crying.

399
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:42,097
You shouldn't say something like that. It is really not respectful.

400
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:44,957
Not respectful?

401
00:31:46,997 --> 00:31:49,697
What should I be afraid of?

402
00:31:57,637 --> 00:32:01,987
It's time. Move the coffin.

403
00:32:09,197 --> 00:32:10,997
Mrs.

404
00:32:22,197 --> 00:32:26,997
Dear, don't leave me behind!

405
00:32:31,597 --> 00:32:36,897
Mrs. Mrs... Mrs. you...

406
00:32:38,597 --> 00:32:41,197
Mrs. wake up. Mrs...

407
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:47,097
Mrs.

408
00:32:51,397 --> 00:32:53,497
Mrs... Mrs...

409
00:32:54,797 --> 00:32:57,597
Mrs... Mrs...

410
00:32:58,697 --> 00:33:00,597
Mrs.

411
00:33:15,197 --> 00:33:19,197
- Niang Niang, Su Pei Sheng has ask to see you.<br>- Niang Niang.

412
00:33:20,197 --> 00:33:21,697
What's wrong?

413
00:33:21,797 --> 00:33:24,497
Niang Niang, please overcome your grief.

414
00:33:27,097 --> 00:33:30,697
Prince Guo's wife has followed his foot step and past aw

415
00:33:37,497 --> 00:33:40,897
- Niang Niang!<br>- Niang Niang, please take care.

416
00:33:42,997 --> 00:33:45,597
His Majesty really respect her death for preserving her chastity.

417
00:33:45,897 --> 00:33:50,697
Already order the proper funeral so she can be buried with Prince Guo.

418
00:34:00,097 --> 00:34:02,197
What about Yuan Che? (their son)

419
00:34:02,697 --> 00:34:06,997
His Majesty said his son is young <br> He'll be given to Sheng Jun Wang and his wife to raise

420
00:34:07,597 --> 00:34:12,097
The prince died suddenly

421
00:34:12,107 --> 00:34:16,027
Also been unable to tell anyone about the situation

422
00:34:16,027 --> 00:34:19,467
He's been getting thinner in a few days

423
00:34:19,997 --> 00:34:22,997
Tell him to contain his grief

424
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:31,797
There is one thing I like to you find out for me.

425
00:34:31,797 --> 00:34:33,697
His Majesty,

426
00:34:35,597 --> 00:34:42,297
Why did His Majesty wants Prince Guo dead all of a sudden?

427
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:47,097
It seems like it was because of some letters.

428
00:34:47,097 --> 00:34:51,097
Letter? What letter?

429
00:35:14,265 --> 00:35:17,310
Peace upon Consort Xi.

430
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,274
Peace upon Consort Xi.

431
00:35:19,274 --> 00:35:21,528
Peace upon Consort Xi.

432
00:35:21,528 --> 00:35:24,098
Peace upon Consort Xi.

433
00:35:24,098 --> 00:35:26,995
Peace upon Consort Xi.

434
00:35:26,995 --> 00:35:31,715
Peace upon Consort Xi.

435
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:34,589
At the end of every letter he sent home,

436
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:37,658
this is what was written.

437
00:35:37,658 --> 00:35:42,242
Jinxi,

438
00:35:42,242 --> 00:35:48,105
every letter had it.

439
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:52,683
Prince Guo really cared about Niang Niang and that's the reason it resulted his death.

440
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:58,712
Yu Li and Yu Ying's letters

441
00:35:58,712 --> 00:36:02,168
Only they can read it

442
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:05,748
Why would His Majesty have it

443
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:08,817
Xia Yi

444
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:12,064
The person Xie Yi brought named Zhan Gan Chu

445
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:13,782
He is definitely a competent person

446
00:36:13,782 --> 00:36:15,816
He especially detect matters about the former dynasty for Emperor

447
00:36:15,816 --> 00:36:17,397
Eliminate the opposition

448
00:36:17,397 --> 00:36:20,558
So that's what it is

449
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:35,558
Jin Xi

450
00:36:35,558 --> 00:36:38,679
I had already grown white hair

451
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:41,427
when I was only 27 years old

452
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:45,913
Concrot Xi

453
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:48,850
Now you are 37 years old

454
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:54,828
Let me help you cover your white hair

455
00:36:54,828 --> 00:36:57,998
In case Emperor feels unhappy when he sees it

456
00:36:57,998 --> 00:37:03,114
The reason why he would feel unpleasant<br> is because he knows I am aging

457
00:37:03,114 --> 00:37:07,069
Rather than he knows about my white hair

458
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:09,904
which is not grown due to him

459
00:37:09,904 --> 00:37:12,765
Let me re-put dressing on your feet for you

460
00:37:16,265 --> 00:37:18,567
Emperor is here

461
00:37:29,067 --> 00:37:31,566
Your Majesty,

462
00:37:37,566 --> 00:37:39,970
You may sit down

463
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,939
Your feet just got better

464
00:37:48,939 --> 00:37:51,518
I heard that you have been to my place earlier this afternoon

465
00:37:52,518 --> 00:37:54,069
Yes

466
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:56,167
I don't think it was a perfect time

467
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:58,352
since you were off to Consort Gui

468
00:37:58,352 --> 00:38:00,901
It's my bad

469
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:03,412
Going out without informing you

470
00:38:03,412 --> 00:38:05,716
How is your feet?

471
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:08,259
I am feeling better now

472
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:12,909
Why are you so careless while walking?

473
00:38:12,909 --> 00:38:18,017
Was it Xiao Xia Zi's negligence?

474
00:38:18,017 --> 00:38:20,044
It's all my fault

475
00:38:20,044 --> 00:38:23,964
Wasn't it caused by heart breaking?

476
00:38:23,964 --> 00:38:29,648
I am very scared

477
00:38:29,648 --> 00:38:32,737
I never hurt anyone

478
00:38:32,737 --> 00:38:38,034
Are you really concerned with Yun Li's death?

479
00:38:38,034 --> 00:38:41,624
Recently, I heard that Emperor was extremely tired

480
00:38:41,624 --> 00:38:44,765
and sleep deprived

481
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:50,884
To be honest, I dream about

482
00:38:50,884 --> 00:38:53,920
what Yunli and me used to be back in old days

483
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,113
We are brothers from long ago, so I feel really sad

484
00:38:58,113 --> 00:39:03,668
Then what about you?

485
00:39:03,668 --> 00:39:07,091
I have been with you for a very long time

486
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:10,368
And you are still suspecting me?

487
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:13,549
It's not that I distrust you

488
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:17,201
But huanhuan, I think you...

489
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:21,670
have changed.<br>-What about you?

490
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,781
Do you still care about me like you did before?

491
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:30,179
Hope we all haven't changed

492
00:39:52,317 --> 00:39:56,667
I'm seeing off the Majesty.
