00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
<i> ~ Episode 75 ~</i>

2
00:00:05,165 --> 00:00:06,391
Greetings your majesty.

3
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:10,446
It's very late.

4
00:00:10,446 --> 00:00:12,463
are you here to do a check up for one of the concubines?

5
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:13,889
your majesty,

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,167
Concubine Xi is a bit sick

7
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:17,975
I am here to bring the herbs/medicine.

8
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:21,227
Concubine Xi has heart problems

9
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:24,943
She has yet gotten over her shock/sadness. Of course, it is heart problems.

10
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:28,552
It's just fear, not sadness

11
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:31,794
Of course. Yu Fujin was just buried.

12
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,718
Then take good care of Concubine Xi for me.

13
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:39,151
yes your majesty.

14
00:00:44,232 --> 00:00:46,838
Why are you here this late?

15
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:48,478
Replying to Niang Niang

16
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:51,598
Concubine Ning Ping asked me for some medicine/herbs.

17
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:53,551
What type of medicine?

18
00:00:53,677 --> 00:00:55,594
Some meds to increase sexsual drive.

19
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:58,048
She's favored by the emperor

20
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,145
Why would she want these things?

21
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:03,842
Concubine Ning specifically asked for the love potions that Consort Li left behind.

22
00:01:03,842 --> 00:01:05,106
But that's not important.

23
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,318
The most crucial thing is

24
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:08,014
She asked me for some pearl powder

25
00:01:08,845 --> 00:01:11,352
Pearl powder. What for?

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,754
Your highness might not be aware

27
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,517
Since his majesty ascension

28
00:01:14,517 --> 00:01:16,661
He has been continously taking pill medicine

29
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,334
To seek longevity

30
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:20,553
Since your highness return a year ago

31
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:22,564
After his majesty's major illness

32
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:24,354
His dosage has increase

33
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:27,941
His prescription contains sulphur as well as mecury

34
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:29,419
Although its not lethal

35
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:31,239
But with the addition of pearl powder

36
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,926
He might look well on the outside

37
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,891
But he is getting weaker and weaker as time goes by

38
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:36,807
plus sensation incense catalysed

39
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:38,691
Internal and external are both hollowed.

40
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:42,220
So Official don't dare to give cinnabar to Concubine Ning.

41
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:48,900
Imperial Concubine Ning wants pearl powder?

42
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:51,526
Perhaps she may have other intentions for it.

43
00:01:52,607 --> 00:01:54,412
If you feel uneasy about it,<br>just don't give it to her then.

44
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,141
If she wants it,

45
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:59,539
she'll naturally find a way to get it.

46
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:03,215
Yes. Your subject understands.

47
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,593
Your majesty has awaken?

48
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:22,147
It looks like the medication Immortal Zhang gave

49
00:02:22,147 --> 00:02:23,227
is actually working quite well.

50
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:29,336
The meds Immortal Zhang gave is really working.

51
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,663
Otherwise...

52
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:36,197
both Guangdong and Guangxi governors wouldn't have strongly recommended me.

53
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:40,314
What incense did you light?

54
00:02:40,314 --> 00:02:44,389
When I smell it, <br>my heart feels warm.

55
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:47,100
It's just the usual Longxian fragrance that you use, <br>Your Majesty.

56
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,451
I just added in a little...

57
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:50,711
other fragrance ingredients that I like.

58
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:53,256
Just as I thought, the fragrance is legendary.

59
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,426
The scent is not as good as your scent.

60
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:14,579
your majesy, you have been looking at documents for a whole morning and noon.

61
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:16,114
and finally you have time to sleep,

62
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:18,244
how come now your getting up again?

63
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:21,106
Court matters will always keep me busy.

64
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:23,368
I will never finish reading all the documents.

65
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,725
Sometimes, I'm lazy.

66
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:29,859
i want life to be unpainful, and short.

67
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:32,628
Why should I work so hard and diligent in government affairs?

68
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,125
I agree to that too.

69
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:43,475
life is short and painful, and you would need some time to rest.

70
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,777
Mother is here?

71
00:03:58,777 --> 00:04:00,500
Greetings, Mother.

72
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:04,310
rise.

73
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:08,194
Mother, the wound on your leg just recovered.<br>Sit down quickly.

74
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:12,357
after my leg injury, I have not have time to come and see you.

75
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:15,130
Its a good thing that your are a modest child.

76
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,730
you do not need me to worry.

77
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:20,323
Just read your books. <br>Hongyan and I will just listen.

78
00:04:21,104 --> 00:04:23,460
I'm hopeful that Hong Yan would be as hardworking as you in the future.

79
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:25,575
your son is not as precious as Hong Yan.

80
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,439
You are both my sons.

81
00:04:28,973 --> 00:04:30,202
Naturally, you won't be lacking.

82
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,047
I do not have as much fortune/luck as Hong Yan.

83
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:36,075
When I first saw you, you were still young.

84
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,508
you have always been in Yuan Ming Yuan.

85
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:42,238
I have always felt guilty,

86
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:44,651
about not bringing you to live with me in the palace earlier.

87
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,479
Only after I met you, Mother,

88
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,083
that I was able to enjoy having a mother.

89
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,611
althoguh now you are not as important as you were before in Imperial father's heart,

90
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:51,941
althoguh now you are not as important as you were before in Imperial father's heart,

91
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:54,116
whatever happens,

92
00:04:54,116 --> 00:04:56,410
i will never leave you alone, run away, and never care about you, mother

93
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,618
Hong Yan and Ling Xi are still young.

94
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:03,226
All my hopes are on you.

95
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:05,940
Yes, your son understands.

96
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:11,526
Reporting to Your Majesty,

97
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:14,110
Even though Your Majesty still young and healthy,

98
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,590
but foundation of a nation should be build early.

99
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:19,108
Your majesty, among your sons,

100
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:20,930
the fourth prince is the oldest.

101
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,713
Please make the fourth prince, the crown prince,

102
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:26,868
so he can help you solve the country's problems.

103
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:32,334
The court never crowns the crown prince based on age.

104
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:35,184
we only look to see if the prince has the ability.

105
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:37,698
Your majesty

106
00:05:37,698 --> 00:05:40,097
The fourth prince<br> has always grown up out side of the Imperial Palace.

107
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:41,266
He is also very educated.

108
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:43,475
I think among all of the princes,

109
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:45,653
only the sixth prince is smart and intelegent.

110
00:05:46,787 --> 00:05:47,781
Your majesty,

111
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,509
The sixth prince is very young<br> how can he hold this important position?

112
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:52,500
Instead, the fourth prince is better.

113
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:53,842
Your Majesty,

114
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:56,167
Concubine Xi was never born in a high position.

115
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,626
She can not be the Matriarch of the nation!

116
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:00,032
Although Sixth Prince is intelligent,

117
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:01,845
as he is still young, his mother will wield the power.

118
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:03,753
Once Concubine Xi becomes the Dowager Queen,

119
00:06:03,753 --> 00:06:06,072
she will take control of the court.

120
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:08,458
Furthermore, Noble Consort Xi <br>was once banished from the harem.

121
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,189
It will invite rumors.

122
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:12,866
She can not become the mother of the crown prince.

123
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,151
In your opinion,

124
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:17,591
you have no objections to the Sixth Prince,

125
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:19,955
but you worry about Noble Consort Xi?

126
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:22,971
I feel that his young age give his mother the power.

127
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:26,793
For example, the Lv and Wu messing with the affairs of state.

128
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:29,979
Furthermore, Noble Consort Xi is not kind by nature.

129
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,873
Otherwise<br> she would not have been banished from the harem before.

130
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:38,947
I have already said before

131
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:44,050
Noble Consort Xi left the palace to pray for the nation.

132
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,830
To think that you assume...

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,015
that since Sixth Prince is born by Noble Consort Xi,

134
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:51,716
he will definitely be used by her?

135
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:53,227
But I have three sons!

136
00:06:53,227 --> 00:06:56,324
two of them are from Concubine Xi

137
00:06:57,754 --> 00:06:58,668
You guys also know,

138
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,477
Fifth Prince is mischievous.

139
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:03,530
I have never think about who to be the crown prince yet.

140
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:06,864
the sixth prince is young and relies on his birth mother.

141
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:08,822
The fourth prince is already a man now.

142
00:07:08,822 --> 00:07:10,877
so he will not have the need to lean on his mother.

143
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:13,386
unlike the sixth prince who is dependant on his mother.

144
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:16,870
If your majesty's wish <br>to make the 6th prince the crown prince,

145
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,569
Please learn from the earlier Emperor and plan ahead.

146
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:23,398
What do you mean plan ahead?

147
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:26,885
Keep the son, get rid of the mother<br> that way there will be no future troubles.

148
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:30,596
You want me to order Concubine Xi to die?

149
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:32,317
Your servant does not dare!

150
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:37,188
Your servant just wants to persuade your majesty,<br> to put the country's affairs up front.

151
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,371
I heard from Su Pei Seng,

152
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:45,026
Your majesty has not been well these past days.

153
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,097
I will use your Qing playing as my breakfast.

154
00:07:54,618 --> 00:07:56,527
I do not have such an amazing ability.

155
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:59,659
Your majesty mustn't put me in such a high position.

156
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:01,889
or else, one day,

157
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,578
Your majesty will listen to one of the officials,<br>and behead me.

158
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:07,760
Giving me a piece of cloth and tell me to hang myself.

159
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:12,645
I thought about it and thought I should let it go.

160
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,210
Your majesty can even still joke.

161
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,022
which represents that your majesty's mood is good.

162
00:08:21,578 --> 00:08:24,251
I am worry about the crown prince's business.

163
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:27,461
The fourth prince is the oldest.

164
00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:31,379
the sixth prince is my favorite.

165
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:33,869
I am pressured by each side.

166
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:36,857
since we've talked up to this point

167
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:39,698
i always think about the 6th prince's birth condition.

168
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,139
I wish that the court business is fair.

169
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:52,051
Your majesty, please listen to what I have to say.

170
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:53,625
say it.

171
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:56,083
the person saying that Hong Yan is young,

172
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,598
so he cannot become the crown prince,

173
00:08:57,598 --> 00:08:58,845
must be dark hearted and evil.

174
00:08:58,845 --> 00:09:00,592
your majesty's health is very good.

175
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:02,681
why can't he wait untill Hong Yan grows up?

176
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:06,700
who ever says that, I don't like either.

177
00:09:08,535 --> 00:09:10,929
so you still think,

178
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:14,413
our child is the best, correct?

179
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:18,708
Hong Yan is only so so. He is not suitable to be crown prince.

180
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:20,963
So for a long term plan,

181
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,204
The 4th prince is the best choice.

182
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:29,098
The 4th prince is not your biological son.

183
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:32,129
what your majesty worries about,<br> is who should be crowned the crown prince,

184
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:34,053
but not if the prince is my biological son.

185
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:38,280
then what if I,

186
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,240
choose another person that was born with a higher position to be the 4th prince's adoption mother,

187
00:09:41,854 --> 00:09:44,510
as long as it is fair, and the country has a heir to the throne,

188
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,672
I have no concerns.

189
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:49,749
after hearing this,

190
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:53,472
I should promote you to the position of empress.

191
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:56,936
I have already received so much from Your Majesty.

192
00:09:56,936 --> 00:09:59,037
I can not compare with Quan Yuan Empress.

193
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:03,019
There are already lots of talk about me.

194
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,449
I really don't want to be put in a spot.

195
00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:10,328
Which would put Your Majesty in a tight spot among all the wives.

196
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:18,293
Thank you your majesty.

197
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,469
if it has to be like this,

198
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:24,241
I will not force you.

199
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:31,629
greetings Concubine Xi.

200
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:32,467
rise.

201
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,379
I past by Ning Hui Hall earlier.

202
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:37,375
I saw the servants have received ordered

203
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,645
to cut all the Albizzia.

204
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:41,933
It is said that the Emperor feels that

205
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:45,058
All the Albizzia's flowers falling to the ground in the Fall, it is really tiresome.

206
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:48,065
His Majesty is not even willing to keep<br> these Hehuan flowers alive.

207
00:10:49,202 --> 00:10:51,733
Those Hehuan flowers were bestowed upon Wang Ye

208
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:52,859
by the previous Emperor when he was 15.

209
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:57,491
It was to wish Wang Ye prosperity and happiness.

210
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:02,812
but what his majesty says is correct.

211
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:07,674
The person is not even here anymore, <br>whats the use for these flowers to stay?

212
00:11:08,524 --> 00:11:09,775
Looks likes this is good too.

213
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,793
I know that you won't say it,

214
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:16,715
and you can't say it,

215
00:11:16,715 --> 00:11:18,737
so I said it for you

216
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:20,634
say what?

217
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:30,636
Those Albizia flower, are from when you were titled.

218
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:32,796
He sent them to you as a gift.

219
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,837
afraid that you would be sad about this,

220
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:41,713
So I told His Majesty that I wouldn't sleep well at night.

221
00:11:41,713 --> 00:11:44,424
Need to keep the Albizia to cook for medicine reason.

222
00:11:44,424 --> 00:11:47,738
It's a good thing that His Majesty has agreed to it.

223
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,913
He ordered people to put those lotuses...

224
00:11:50,913 --> 00:11:52,590
in my palace.

225
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:54,458
Thank you

226
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:58,857
then don't let him go easily.

227
00:12:02,717 --> 00:12:03,630
don't worry.

228
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:09,410
mother.

229
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,162
greetings mother.

230
00:12:13,255 --> 00:12:14,678
You're already a man with your own family.

231
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:16,677
Whenever you're happy, you still forget yourself!

232
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:17,812
Today at Court,

233
00:12:17,812 --> 00:12:20,033
Imperial Father granted me the title of Prince of Bao!

234
00:12:21,186 --> 00:12:22,222
That's what you deserve!

235
00:12:22,222 --> 00:12:23,568
You're the eldest son.

236
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:25,505
And naturally the first Ruling Prince among the Imperial sons.

237
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,854
But Sixth Brother hasn't been made a ruling prince yet.

238
00:12:28,184 --> 00:12:29,287
6th prince is still young.

239
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:32,027
Furthermore, I hope...

240
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:34,951
that his Princely estate will be bestowed by you.

241
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:38,975
Mother.

242
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:40,484
if you understand what mother means,

243
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:41,905
then you must know what to do.

244
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:46,838
Don't display your intentions, <br>and do not allow people to know your thoughts.

245
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:50,402
More importantly, <br>don't allow people to guess your preferences.

246
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:52,318
Yes.

247
00:12:53,597 --> 00:12:54,603
next month,

248
00:12:54,603 --> 00:12:57,000
is your Imperial Father's birthday.

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,196
your Imperial Father is getting old.

250
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,940
yes, your son will try his best.

251
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,027
and plan the birthday celebration greatly.

252
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:05,890
then make it great.

253
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,114
yes

254
00:13:15,013 --> 00:13:19,001
I wish Your Majesty Happy Birthday and have many more of them in the future.

255
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:22,193
To celebrate Your Majesty's birthday,

256
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:26,668
My Younger disciple and I have made another 2 elixir. (for living forever)

257
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:29,308
Special brought it to give it to Your Majesty.

258
00:13:31,088 --> 00:13:32,362
You are thoughtful.

259
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:36,861
But I wonder, after I consume this pill,

260
00:13:36,861 --> 00:13:39,581
will I really live a long life?

261
00:13:42,095 --> 00:13:43,848
Your Majesty, your complexion...

262
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:46,997
is looking a lot better than previously.

263
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,384
I've been accompanying Your Majesty everyday.

264
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:53,970
I too, feel that you've been more energetic...

265
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,097
like before.

266
00:13:56,555 --> 00:13:57,448
That's good then.

267
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:00,991
After taking the elixir, Your Majesty shouldn't overwork.

268
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:02,509
Please make sure you remember it.

269
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,413
Then I will move to Yuan Ming Yuan. (The Imperial Garden)

270
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,971
Less rules and trouble.

271
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,832
Niangniang, I have something to report.

272
00:14:29,772 --> 00:14:31,299
Recently, Concubine Ning...

273
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:33,872
has been asking for pearl powder with increasing frequency.

274
00:14:34,859 --> 00:14:37,489
On the surface, His Majesty's complexion looks good.

275
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:40,267
But in fact, foundation of his body is getting weaker.

276
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:43,945
Have the other physicians in the medical department detected anything?

277
00:14:43,945 --> 00:14:46,385
This is a slow poison. It can't be detected.

278
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,041
That's good then.

279
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:50,210
If Consort Ning asks for it, just give it to her.

280
00:14:51,295 --> 00:14:53,684
Besides, I never heard anything.

281
00:14:54,232 --> 00:14:55,961
Yes. This subject understands.

282
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:01,411
You guys accompany me

283
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:02,637
to visit His Majesty later.

284
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:06,543
Greetings, Noble Consort Xi.

285
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:08,699
Greetings, Noble Consort Xi.

286
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,907
Hearing the qin for too long makes it boring.

287
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:11,260
I want something more exciting.

288
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,336
Then shall we play something else?

289
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:17,314
Your Majesty, Meimei and I will guess riddles.

290
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:18,290
Yeah!

291
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,503
Your Majesty, listen.

292
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:20,363
Who is inside?

293
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:22,331
They are two Young Mistresses of the rank of Promise.

294
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:28,056
Then I'll come back tomorrow to see His Majesty.

295
00:15:29,223 --> 00:15:31,033
His Majesty doesn't take care of his own body.

296
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,391
His Majesty thought that he's regained his strength.

297
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:36,963
You are the head of the Imperial Medical department.

298
00:15:36,963 --> 00:15:39,212
You should be showcasing your ability.

299
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:42,375
Don't let him between the wives

300
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,522
feel the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

301
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,821
Niangniang, don't worry.

302
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:47,065
All these stuffs are originally from Concubine Li.

303
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:49,634
It can be handy to Concubine Ning.

304
00:15:49,634 --> 00:15:52,238
His Majesty is eating it up.

305
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:54,079
Just remind her to be careful.

306
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:55,305
Yes.

307
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:00,692
Your Majesty.

308
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:02,452
Shall we guess another riddle?

309
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:05,071
Your Majesty, slowly.

310
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:07,058
Do you have any other riddles, Jiejie?

311
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:09,091
Quickly think of more!

312
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:10,720
Your Majesty!

313
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,746
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

314
00:16:12,746 --> 00:16:14,188
Your Majesty!

315
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:15,517
What's wrong? What's going on?

316
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:18,444
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

317
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,283
What's wrong, Your Majesty?

318
00:16:19,283 --> 00:16:21,382
Summon the physician!

319
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:47,275
It's summer again.

320
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:52,654
His Majesty has been nursing the illness on and off for 6 months now.

321
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:55,361
Even though living at Yuan Ming Yuan (the Imperial Garden) is very quiet.

322
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:57,184
But it doesn't seem to be getting better.

323
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:00,677
His Majesty worry about the affairs concerning politics.

324
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:02,625
Tell Su Peisheng...

325
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,339
to send the folded notebook (relate to work in the old day.)

326
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,360
He will definitely read them.

327
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:09,337
His Majesty dislike the power taken by others.

328
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:12,811
Any folded notebook sent to him would be read by him personally for sure.

329
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,414
It's just that his health is no longer like before.

330
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,865
How can he work like before...

331
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:20,353
and read official documents for 12-14 hours?

332
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:23,333
Where are Hongyan and Lingxi?

333
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:27,980
The princess has gone to Noble Consort Jing's residence to play with Longyue.

334
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,294
Sixth Prince is living with Duchess Shen.

335
00:17:31,294 --> 00:17:32,918
He is playing at the garden right now.

336
00:17:34,944 --> 00:17:37,096
Your Majesty, even though it is summer time,

337
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:38,472
the winds are still strong.

338
00:17:38,472 --> 00:17:41,843
Your Majesty, hold on to my hand and walk slowly.

339
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:44,475
Don't let the wind blow at you.

340
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:48,164
It is already summer?

341
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:51,716
I still feel cold.

342
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:54,780
It's like there is a leak in my body.

343
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:57,653
Your Majesty, you're still healthy!

344
00:17:57,653 --> 00:17:59,983
But lately, you've been engaging too much in marital relations.

345
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:02,231
You have to be careful.

346
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:13,278
I just like watching those...

347
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:15,847
flower-like faces...

348
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,353
Looking at Consort Ning so young,

349
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:22,679
I feel young myself too.

350
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:25,040
Then, Your Majesty, just look.

351
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,864
Don't let your royal body...

352
00:18:30,723 --> 00:18:31,368
Prince!

353
00:18:32,342 --> 00:18:33,761
Slowly!

354
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:34,554
Who is over there?

355
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,822
- Don't haul me. <br>- Slow down.

356
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:40,732
Your Majesty, that's Duchess Shen...

357
00:18:40,732 --> 00:18:42,027
and her eldest son.

358
00:18:42,027 --> 00:18:43,808
He's playing with Sixth Prince.

359
00:18:44,486 --> 00:18:45,293
Her eldest son?

360
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:46,399
Yes.

361
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:47,872
Is it...

362
00:18:47,872 --> 00:18:49,464
17th Brother's son, Yuan Che?

363
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,753
Exactly.

364
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:52,386
Yuan Che, come here!

365
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,923
His Majesty has arrived.

366
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:05,509
Peace to His Majesty. <br>Peace to Imperial Father.

367
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:06,582
All of you, rise.

368
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:10,303
It's so rare for you to enter the palace. <br>Don't feel too constrained.

369
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:12,826
Thank you, Your Majesty.

370
00:19:15,943 --> 00:19:18,595
Hongyan...really needs playmates.

371
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:20,413
It's a pity this palace...

372
00:19:20,413 --> 00:19:21,910
has no princes who are around his age.

373
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:26,148
When you're free, bring Yuan Che into the palace frequently to play.

374
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:27,142
Yes.

375
00:19:27,142 --> 00:19:29,476
The two of them get along really well.

376
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:33,074
Come here. You too.

377
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,119
They do look like brothers.

378
00:19:41,645 --> 00:19:44,164
It's just that Hongyan looks stronger.

379
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:48,512
Let me carry him.

380
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,446
Your Majesty!

381
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:54,820
I can't carry you anymore!

382
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,028
Sixth Prince is older. He is much stronger.

383
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:59,556
But he does look very much like the young lord.

384
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:01,182
It's almost like they're biological brothers.

385
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,952
What did you say?

386
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,565
Wet Nurse said Hong Yan and Yuan Che are like blood brother.

387
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:11,567
Let me take a look.

388
00:20:24,504 --> 00:20:25,508
They really do look alike.

389
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:30,211
Especially the eyes and the jaw.

390
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:34,693
It really looks alike.

391
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,381
Emperor, you are tired.

392
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:52,864
Your Majesty.

393
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:54,343
Your Majesty.

394
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:56,708
I heard that when His Majesty had his dizzy spells, <br>you were present too.

395
00:20:57,836 --> 00:20:58,956
His Majesty was acting weird.

396
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:00,792
We were talking normally, and he suddenly fainted.

397
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:01,888
What did you talk about?

398
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:04,534
We were just talking about Sixth Prince's<br> and Yuan Che's features.

399
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:05,449
And we were discussing...

400
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:07,525
that Sixth Prince's eyes and jaw looked like Yuan Che.

401
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:11,969
His Majesty is not very well.

402
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:14,251
Don't bring Yuan Che into the palace so frequently anymore...

403
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:15,845
to lessen any trouble.

404
00:21:16,092 --> 00:21:17,074
I understand.

405
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:20,813
In this past year the Emperor's health has not been well

406
00:21:21,705 --> 00:21:22,865
Duke Shen is a close relative.

407
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,775
Have him pay more attention to what's going on <br>inside and outside the palace.

408
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:27,419
I understand

409
00:21:40,823 --> 00:21:43,088
Go.

410
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,614
Fine. All of you, go out.

411
00:21:47,998 --> 00:21:49,273
Go out.

412
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:03,398
Your Majesty, you must see the physician!

413
00:22:05,837 --> 00:22:07,125
Bring Xiayi over.

414
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,039
I have something important for him.

415
00:22:10,658 --> 00:22:11,554
Yes.

416
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:30,648
Sixth Prince got a shock today.

417
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:33,029
It wasn't easy for him to finally fall asleep.

418
00:22:36,444 --> 00:22:38,107
I'm afraid His Majesty got a shock today as well.

419
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:39,715
Why?

420
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:41,333
Have you never realized...

421
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,999
that Hong Yan and Yuan Che are looking <br>more and more alike?

422
00:22:46,438 --> 00:22:49,005
They're cousins. Of course they'll look alike.

423
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:50,505
Jingxi.

424
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:54,027
I'm afraid His Majesty has gotten suspicious.

425
00:22:56,095 --> 00:22:57,308
What you mean is that...

426
00:22:57,308 --> 00:23:01,616
His Majesty suddenly had an attack because of Sixth Prince...

427
00:23:02,396 --> 00:23:03,880
We cannot not take precautions.

428
00:23:08,782 --> 00:23:11,022
Niangniang, Noble Consort Jing's Ruyi has come.

429
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,461
She said something big happened in the harem. <br>She's requesting an audience.

430
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:14,889
Let her in.

431
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:15,903
Yes.

432
00:23:20,301 --> 00:23:22,078
It's regarding the royal bloodline.

433
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:24,838
You must be extremely conscientious.

434
00:23:27,002 --> 00:23:28,270
And do this job well.

435
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:29,942
Your Majesty is saying...

436
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,949
that you've done a paternity test with Sixth Prince before?

437
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:34,710
Nothing is absolute.

438
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:38,772
Go investigate it again.<br>Remember...

439
00:23:40,229 --> 00:23:41,840
don't let anyone find out.

440
00:23:42,374 --> 00:23:43,450
I will definitely carry it out.

441
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:01,946
Peace to Niangniang.

442
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:03,894
Where's His Majesty?

443
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:07,079
His Majesty just took his medication. <br>He's fallen asleep.

444
00:24:07,277 --> 00:24:08,493
I'll go in to take a look.

445
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:10,459
Yes.

446
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:13,308
Open the door.

447
00:24:27,142 --> 00:24:28,231
Meimei, you've come.

448
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:30,451
Jiejie, dispense with courtesy.

449
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,474
These few days, you've been taking care of His Majesty.

450
00:24:33,474 --> 00:24:34,889
It's been hard on you.

451
00:24:35,347 --> 00:24:37,048
What's hardship are you talking about?

452
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:38,809
We do everything for His Majesty's sake.

453
00:24:42,562 --> 00:24:44,727
Oh yes...

454
00:24:44,727 --> 00:24:47,874
The weather hasn't been too good these days.<br>I'm worried that your leg ailments are going to act up again.

455
00:24:47,874 --> 00:24:50,440
You must take care of your health, Noble Consort.

456
00:24:51,148 --> 00:24:54,129
After falling from the terrace, <br>the pain in my leg has become a constant.

457
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:56,186
I've gotten used to it.

458
00:24:58,723 --> 00:25:00,064
I instructed the kitchen...

459
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:01,885
to steam some ginseng soup for His Majesty.

460
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:05,818
His Majesty's body has gotten so weak.

461
00:25:05,818 --> 00:25:08,100
He still keeps eating the Elixir. (med supposedly to make you live forever)

462
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,967
Did not holding back at all.

463
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:13,667
His Majesty is very stubborn.

464
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,202
You and I

465
00:25:15,202 --> 00:25:17,272
often tell His Majesty to take care of his health.

466
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:19,441
His Majesty often just laugh about it.

467
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:22,494
Sister has been busy lately.

468
00:25:23,118 --> 00:25:24,057
Take good rest.

469
00:25:25,197 --> 00:25:26,084
I will.

470
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:34,754
About Promise Sun...

471
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:37,204
Did Noble Consort Jing mentioned it to you?

472
00:25:38,317 --> 00:25:39,750
What do you think you will do?

473
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:41,701
This matter,

474
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:44,348
I got to talk to His Majesty.

475
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:49,073
You need to take your time though.

476
00:25:49,073 --> 00:25:51,223
Don't let His Majesty got too angry.

477
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:55,448
Your thought is also mine as well.

478
00:26:12,707 --> 00:26:13,698
Be careful!

479
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:22,452
Niang Niang, Xia Yi has came to see His Majesty.

480
00:26:22,452 --> 00:26:25,056
Even Imperial Noble Consort got sent away because of it.

481
00:26:25,056 --> 00:26:27,090
Servant is very worry about His Majesty.

482
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,666
I over heard that

483
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:32,144
it is about Niang Niang and Sixth Prince.

484
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:35,301
I got it.

485
00:26:36,536 --> 00:26:38,265
Take all the servants with you.

486
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,298
I will be here tonight.

487
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:42,244
No one is allowed to be in.

488
00:26:42,616 --> 00:26:43,535
Yes.

489
00:27:08,152 --> 00:27:09,494
Noble Consort Xi.

490
00:27:11,117 --> 00:27:12,477
how long have you been here?

491
00:27:13,277 --> 00:27:15,696
When I came, you'd just fallen asleep.

492
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:20,062
If you're tired of sleeping,<br>why don't you sit up?

493
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:28,075
You are Noble Consort.

494
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:32,543
Just leave these chores to the servants.

495
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:39,843
Everything I have is given by Your Majesty.

496
00:27:40,906 --> 00:27:43,543
So I never forget it.

497
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:47,775
I can only return the favour by taking good care of Your Majesty.

498
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,505
Noble Consort Xi.

499
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,664
You never use these kind of big flashy words.

500
00:27:55,353 --> 00:27:56,560
In the past, Your Majesty

501
00:27:57,601 --> 00:27:59,491
never call me Nobel Consort Xi in private either.

502
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:27,503
I was going to touch your hair.

503
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,028
But I ended up with

504
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:34,508
the feeling of the cold and beautiful decoration. (on your hair)

505
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:39,259
I remember in the past

506
00:28:40,293 --> 00:28:42,316
when we were here to relieve summer heat (because Yuan Ming Yuan is further North than the Palace)

507
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:45,705
In the evening, when there is nothing else to do,

508
00:28:46,697 --> 00:28:47,960
we would relax in a cool place.

509
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:54,917
Your hair were just loose.

510
00:28:59,764 --> 00:29:03,122
You rest your head on my knee

511
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:06,532
without anything on it.

512
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,209
It was very beautiful.

513
00:29:16,183 --> 00:29:17,648
Wrist on the man's knee

514
00:29:18,937 --> 00:29:20,155
Anywhere is not pitiful?

515
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,849
Noble Consort Xi.

516
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:35,949
Your beauty hasn't changed one bit from the past.

517
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:40,249
Thank you for your praise, Your Majesty.

518
00:29:41,449 --> 00:29:44,449
Oh yes. The Empress came to request...

519
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,349
to visit you.

520
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:49,349
I said it before.

521
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:52,149
I will not ever see her again, in life and in death.

522
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,849
Then I'll send someone to pass the message.

523
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:03,349
Your Majesty, drink some ginseng soup.

524
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:09,549
You've lost weight. <br>Don't work too hard.

525
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:12,349
My reaction is not that good.

526
00:30:12,449 --> 00:30:16,249
The important matters still need your decision.

527
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:20,349
So, Your Majesty, you must take care of your body.

528
00:30:24,249 --> 00:30:25,649
Definitely.

529
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,549
Not just for you,

530
00:30:28,949 --> 00:30:31,649
but for our Hong Yan as well.

531
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:37,949
A father knows his son best.

532
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:47,849
There's a matter which has been giving me a dilemma.

533
00:30:47,949 --> 00:30:51,749
I already discuss with Imperial Noble Consort and Noble Consort Jing, but we couldn't decide.

534
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,949
We need your decision.

535
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:55,176
Tell me.

536
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:59,349
This isn't too difficult either.

537
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:02,149
It's just that it affects the honor of the Imperial family.

538
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:05,349
I have no choice but to seek your decision.

539
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:06,749
Say it.

540
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:13,249
Promise Sun and an Imperial guard had an affair.

541
00:31:13,418 --> 00:31:14,947
Noble Consort Jing...

542
00:31:14,949 --> 00:31:17,749
has already had them locked up at her palace.

543
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:20,449
We're now waiting for Your Majesty's decision...

544
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:22,749
to see how we should deal with them.

545
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,949
I've just fallen ill, and she's having an affair?

546
00:31:27,449 --> 00:31:29,849
Does she think that I'm already dead?

547
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,849
Your Majesty, please calm down.

548
00:31:36,849 --> 00:31:38,849
When did this happen?

549
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:41,349
Tell me all the details.

550
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:46,749
The other night, Noble Consor Jing and Imperial Concubine Xin walked by Promise Sun's place.

551
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:51,349
They over head sound at the garden.

552
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:54,949
They thought it were servant not behaving properly.

553
00:31:55,249 --> 00:32:00,549
But they discovered both Promise Sun and the thug were disheveled.

554
00:32:01,349 --> 00:32:05,949
The couple were just at it.

555
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,349
Noble Consort Jing detain them both right away.

556
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:14,049
When I get it in a hurry, they both still sweating like pigs.

557
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:18,549
Promise Sun's red underwear was on the thug's belt.

558
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:22,049
It is the absolutely truth. No way to deny about it.

559
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:26,749
We can only grounded Promise Sun and sent the thug to the torture chamber.

560
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,749
Whore!

561
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:38,949
- This matter was known by many people. We were afraid to make the wrong decision.<br> Many people know?

562
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:43,949
Kill her.

563
00:32:44,949 --> 00:32:47,849
Have her body split by 5 different horses!

564
00:32:47,949 --> 00:32:52,749
Your Majesty, calm down. <br>You can execute her in any way you please.

565
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:06,149
It also happened in a couldy day like this.

566
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:11,349
I was hiding behind the curtains.

567
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:17,349
Longkodo hold on to my Mother tightly.

568
00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:26,549
My Father is the son of the God!

569
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:38,149
I am also son of the God.

570
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:44,049
Why did all of you have to betray me?

571
00:33:45,749 --> 00:33:50,749
Why did all of you betray me?

572
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,249
You Majesty has not past away yet.

573
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:41,449
You're all in such a hurry to cry?

574
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:51,849
How did His Majesty become so seriously ill all of a sudden?

575
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:55,049
When the eunuch came to report it, <br>we all got a big fright!

576
00:34:55,549 --> 00:34:58,449
Your Majesty's heath could go up and down.

577
00:34:58,949 --> 00:35:00,749
It is still time.

578
00:35:00,749 --> 00:35:05,249
If you can hold it at this point, there will be more days for us to be sad.

579
00:35:06,549 --> 00:35:13,149
So who should stay here to take care of His Majesty? Or should we take turn?

580
00:35:13,149 --> 00:35:19,049
Any of us are not good choice. We, women, cry first whenever things happen.

581
00:35:19,149 --> 00:35:21,949
It will only irratate His Majesty when he hears it.

582
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:27,449
What about we all stay in our own bedroom.

583
00:35:27,549 --> 00:35:31,549
When His Majesty wakes up, he will call the person he wants to see.

584
00:35:31,749 --> 00:35:33,549
That is good too.

585
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:35,649
Alright.

586
00:35:41,649 --> 00:35:43,749
The Emperor is very sick

587
00:35:44,149 --> 00:35:48,149
The Doctor has ask His Majesty to rest in quiet.

588
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:53,449
From now on, no matter which concubine wants to see His Majesty,

589
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:58,149
everyone needs to go through me and ask the Doctor first before doing so.

590
00:35:58,749 --> 00:36:05,349
Everyone of us needs to take care of our own Princes and princesses.

591
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:12,549
Kids are still young. If any of them distrubed His Majesty's rest, I won't be able to take on the sin.

592
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:14,349
Okay.

593
00:36:15,149 --> 00:36:18,349
Right now, His Majesty's health is our primary concern.

594
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:21,649
If any interfered with His Majesty's health healing process,

595
00:36:21,749 --> 00:36:27,149
don't blame me not to take in the consideration of us being sisters wives.

596
00:36:28,149 --> 00:36:31,349
Why do you need to be using such harsh words?

597
00:36:33,049 --> 00:36:39,849
It is all because of Promise Sun's incident so His Majesty's health decline.

598
00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:45,649
Since His Majesty is very ill, we should contact the Royal Household Bureau to get ready.

599
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:49,749
The Coffin was already prepared months ago.

600
00:36:51,749 --> 00:36:53,849
What what just happened,

601
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:58,549
- we need to ask some of His Majesty's brothers to come into Palace.

602
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:01,899
Okay, I will arrange that right away.

603
00:37:03,749 --> 00:37:09,249
We got to be strong so both inside and outside the Palace won't be in a mess.

604
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:16,549
We will each do our jobs. We can met if there is anything require we to discuss.

605
00:37:23,649 --> 00:37:25,849
Why is Imperial concubine Xin not here?

606
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:32,749
You know Imperial concubine Xin's temper. If she wants to come,she comes. If she doesn't want to come, she won't show.

607
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:36,249
Let her be.

608
00:38:57,749 --> 00:39:00,249
Why did you brought them here?

609
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:06,049
If I didn't bring them here, you would not have known if your son were kill in his dream.

610
00:39:06,549 --> 00:39:09,449
- Jin Xi. <br>- Yes.

611
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:11,609
- Xiao Yun Zi. <br>- Yes.

612
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,749
Bring them back to their bedroom.

613
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:31,049
Xia Yi has use drug to put everyone to sleep and puncture his toe to get some blood.

614
00:39:31,049 --> 00:39:37,849
Xia Yi works for His Majesty so I bet His Majesty ask Xia Yi to do the DNA Blood test again.

615
00:39:38,149 --> 00:39:42,849
But I don't understand. Why does His Majesty want to do the DNA test again?

616
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:46,849
Hong Yan is who's kid?

617
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:52,949
Please take a bowl from Zhen Huan.

618
00:39:55,349 --> 00:40:00,249
You have done me a great faour. You have saved Yun Li's children.

619
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:06,182
<i>Thank you for watching!</i>
